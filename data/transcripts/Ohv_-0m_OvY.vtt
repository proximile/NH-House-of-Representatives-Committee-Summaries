00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
9h I wanted to thank the I'll second
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
that oh thank you would you like to
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you Mr
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm a strong supporter of
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
personal privacy I think that's
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
something we take dearly here in the
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think what I'm trying to
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
do is amend the bill for
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
clarification in working with both
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
the represent Lon and also the
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services I
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
think this finds that Sweet
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
Spot currently the department does not
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
share data within the registry now so
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's really not an issue it's going
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
forward what we do second changes the
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
terminology from data to
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
information in talking with the
 
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
Department I came across the fact that
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
something called personally identifiable
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
information which is different then Phi
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
which is patient health information
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
patient health information is defined by
 
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.470 align:start position:0%
patient health information is defined by
Hippa

00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
Hippa
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
this is a terminology used a lot in
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
cyberspace or into technology and so
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
forth so it's more broader if you will
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
but it's clear to what we're trying to
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish and
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
thirdly what I wanted to be sure of is
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
that if a provider goes into the
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
registry whether it be a school
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner pharmacist whoever go
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
into the registry that if they extract
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
the information from the data to put it
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
into the medical record on behalf of the
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
patient that is not included with
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions um it becomes very
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
difficult and owners some if you
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
basically want to have every single
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
provider who's ever take anything out of
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
the registry to have them go back and go
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
through their records to to remove it so
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
therefore I want to be clear that this
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
does not apply to a provider who takes
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
information out of the registry as far
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
as the ability for the state when they
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
go into any kind of sharing of
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
information we currently have the same
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
situation with the prescription duck
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring program
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
our state law is very clear who can have
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
access to that data it's medical records
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
the prescription data if the state wants
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
to share that data with another state
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
they have to ensure that that state will
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
abide by our state laws and that in fact
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
is what happens in that program as well
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
so whenever they have a contract with
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
another state to share the data that
 
00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:22.759 align:start position:0%
state has to comply with our state laws
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a sweet spot is
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to protect privacy
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
at the same time allow
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
access thank you representative Lon uh
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you very
 
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:36.759 align:start position:0%
much representative Merchant for um
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
taking the lead on getting this
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
amendment I really appreciate everything
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
that you do in order to Value personal
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
privacy and everything to support people
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
here in the state and I really thank you
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
for your work on this um I'm going to
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
support this obviously and I think this
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
will be great to move forward and just
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we're removing a
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
potential for concern from people and
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our data will be handled
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
correctly so thank you other
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman um I also
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate um the two Representatives
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
working on this together to get a
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
compromise that um hopefully we can
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
support um I'm just curious um there was
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
an on the initial bill there was a
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
financial note of $3 million and then
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
that was amended and
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
um I believe this is the case reduced
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
to 160 to
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
$180,000 for fiscal year 2025 and then
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so I'm curious with the
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
amendment is this fiscal note
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
still likely
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
accurate um thank you representative Sor
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you it should be accurate
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
because this is just specifying that
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
language um that was in order to have
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
somebody work at the department in order
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure sure that these that um we
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
do have the correct data entry sections
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
um this is ear bill so it's headed off
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
to finance off to finance but we have
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
removed that $3 million charge through
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
both the prior Amendment and this one so
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's been a good
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
move you all set representative follow
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
just I'm going to vote for this because
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the fact that um people are
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
working together to um protect private
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
um but I'm also aware of uh um what was
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
said on the floor last week about the
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money that's going to
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
be available for um Finance
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
to um appropriate for all these things
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
that are coming forward and um this
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
would likely not be my
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
priority representative Lon um thank you
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I recognize that we
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
have limited funds um because we are not
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
sharing and we are not in the process of
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
entering into any contracts at this
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
point I think that that fiscal Noe is
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
actually premature for spending in this
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
year whenever we do look to um to agree
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
to contract in order to share that
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
information in the future there will be
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
a cost to it there may be I assume that
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
there will be this additional cost when
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
we do make that choice and put this out
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
um for the contracts but until we make
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
that choice to share the data externally
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
with with other states or other bodies
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
then I don't expect that we'd be
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
spending that
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
money thank you for that clarification
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant to follow up on
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you for the
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
question representative Sho my
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is because we're not
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
currently sharing data there's no change
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
that has to occur within the department
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
so therefore there's no need for fiscal
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
funds however if the department elects
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
to share or want to share data with
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
another state and therefore have to be
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
sure that things are in place and so
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
forth at that point in time it would
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
require some fiscal funds to do it so
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
currently based upon the way the
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
amendment's written there should be no
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
impact financially to the state however
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
if the department wanted to do something
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
they would have to come back and asked
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
funds other
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%

voting Mr chairman yes representative
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
Weber um I'm wondering about consent

there's no appropriation to the bill so
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
and it is going to finance so um there's
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
no objection my hope is that it could go
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
on consent sure especially as it's going
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
to finance next okay yeah if there's no
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
objection uh Christino do you are we you
 
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
okay on that or do you
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
know you don't okay you were giving me
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a look back there so I wasn't
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
sure okay if there's no objection we'll
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
put we'll put that on
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Shapiro you have an
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
believe yes I do yes I
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
do so I would move or to pass or I would
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
move adopting
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment 0416 on House Bill 1593 and
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
around okay I'll give it a moment to
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%

00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%

to the hearing to um testify about this
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.630 align:start position:0%
this bill
concerns

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
um certain kinds of recreational
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
activities that were previously paid for
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
through um a CMS waiver for
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled people so these
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
are um these are activities that people
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
do that are not like going to a
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic dance class for disabled
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
people but going to regular activities
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the community um to improve people's
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
um socialization and to improve people's
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
integration into the community and um
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
there was a great deal of support and I
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
think there was a great deal of support
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
in this committee as well um so since
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
the hearing um I've been working with
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and um DHHS and
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody representing the area agencies
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
and what we have done with this
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is um number one we have
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
reduced the original appropriation from
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
a million to
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
$500,000 we have also taken out um
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
making this a Permanent Fund so this
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
will not be a Permanent Fund this will
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
be a stop Gap
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
measure um to fund these Services until
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle when this will be
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
addressed um in a more integrated way
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
um those are the two major changes that
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so um this is a bill that um the
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
I've been working with attorney namoth
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
has supported um it's got to go to
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee where it'll face the
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
same hurdles as I was just talking about
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
with the last bill which is that there
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
are limited funds and um a lot of
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are heading there um but
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is something that we can
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
support um that
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
will support developmentally disabled
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
people being able to have a full life in
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
the community and um um they've had it
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
before this was um either a change in
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
CMS rules or or a newly new
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation of CMS rules that made it
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that all of a sudden they couldn't be
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
paid for so I would ask you to support
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
adopting Amendment
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
0416 okay thank you other
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lon um thank
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro for all the work
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
you've put into this
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think that it's absolutely critical
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we make sure that these services
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
are restored um and I think that it's
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
actually most important that we restore
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
it first to those people who were
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
already receiving these funds previously
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
because we already know that those
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
people had these programs they knew how
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
to do it they had already been vetted
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
and approved through their area agencies
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
and so the idea of addressing them first
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
and then handling anything else that
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
will require a little bit more work to
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
get those approved and get those paid
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
for I think would be a strong stronger
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
path forward to make sure that we're
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
restoring those funds as quickly as we
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
possibly can um I think that it's been
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
an absolute travesty that um the way
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
that this whole shakeup that came from
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government has impacted this
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
really important really special
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
community that we need to make sure that
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
we are all supporting um has been just
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
terrible but we also need to make sure
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
that those people who are already
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
receiving services are the ones who are
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
first restored so um I I really
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate as far as representative
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
Shapiro came on this one um but I think
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
that it's um I I'll have another
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
amendment to present that um would then
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize the people who missed that um
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
who were already receiving services so
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate the work it just
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far enough for me um so thank
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber um if if we are
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
going to be asked to
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
consider the contents of another
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
amendment as well as this Amendment
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to have that passed
 
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
out um so I already passed that out so I
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
can change what I said I simply don't
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
think that this amendment goes far
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
enough in order to ensure that we're
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
restoring services so I don't even need
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
to reference it regardless of whether or
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
not that other Amendment passes I think
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
the first thing we need to do is restore
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
the services to the people who had them
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
ripped away from them when the federal
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
government made us change the way we
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
provide these services to me that is the
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
critical point and um I don't think that
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment goes far enough so I
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
won't be supporting it thank you
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
represent Weber understood I'm just
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
trying to work out for myself the order
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
in which we're dealing with things the
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
ability to read what I haven't read yet
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
and decide
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
whether um whether I want to support the
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
one or the other because while I am I
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate your point and I in many ways
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
agree with it I
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
am rendered very uncomfortable by saying
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
that we're creating a two-tiered system
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
here and that's what it sounds like I'm
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
hearing you saying so I need to read the
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
bills the the Amendments before I make a
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
determination CL I vote for
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
clarification at
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
06338 right representative Lon correct
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the one I handed out before
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's two pages that are stapled together
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
if you open it up and turn to the second
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
page um it basically just says that we
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize has to be some way in which
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
all of the cases are handled is it
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
alphabetically is it by the date
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
received or is it by the people who have
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
already receive these
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
Services representative
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
Shapiro um I I would like to speak to
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
the two amendments if I can I don't um I
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't really we have a motion on the
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
floor for one I don't think we can
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
consider the other at the same
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
time representative we are the
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary expert here I I
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
what we have done what I used to do when
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
I was chairing was I would have them
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
both handed out I would discuss both of
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
them before I take a motion we have a
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
motion um committee procedure is very
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
very loose as you know and there are
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
very few guidelines for it I certainly
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
have no objection if nobody else does if
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
if we allow reference to both while
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
people are trying to make up their minds
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
on the one before us I don't see any
 
00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
better way of coming to a properly
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
reasoned conclusion so uh while it may
 
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.789 align:start position:0%
reasoned conclusion so uh while it may
not

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
be just seems sensible to me that we
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
should be able to consider and and speak
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
about the merits of both because I think
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
they both do have Merit all right I
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
proceed representative shapo okay so if
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
you have both amendments in front of you
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
one is 0416 that's the amendment where
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
there's a motion um and then there's 0 6
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
33h which is the um amendment that um
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative Leon has sponsored and
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
has um just discussed and um you take my
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
word for it without reading it they're
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
exactly identical except on page two
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
lines one and two of Representative
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
Leon's Amendment those that line is
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
added the Department of Health and Human
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
Service shall prioritize payment for
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
service provided to July prior to July
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 that were reduced or excluded
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
from payment after such date other than
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
that they're identical
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
um I have been working with the
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have everybody on
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
board so I was absolutely fine when um
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
um amendment was when I saw
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Le Leon's Amendment
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't think prioritization is
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
necessary but I don't think it makes any
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
practical difference I think there's
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
enough money appropriated that anybody
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
who um deserves and you know it's it's
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
clinically determined that they need
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
these um services will get them so I
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a practical
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
difference however in working with the
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
various parties um I was told by
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
attorney namoth at Department of Health
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't support that language
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
so so therefore I think that we should
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
and and she is present if we want to
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
hear from her um so therefore my
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
priority is number one to get um as full
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
of support as possible from this
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee so that it go forth to finance
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
committee where they'll look at it again
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
um and that could be either Amendment
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
but I think it makes sense for us to go
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
to to put this forward with an amendment
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
that DHHS can support because I think
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
that in the long run that will give us
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
the best chance of it um becoming
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
statute and people getting these
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
services so those are the two
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
distinctions I don't know if we want to
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
hear from um attorney nth about what the
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
particular issue is with those two lines
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
or not I will leave that up to the
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
chair I would represented Weber I would
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
find it helpful if we could have a very
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
brief statement from
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
namoth uh good morning Mr chairman
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Melissa nth I'm an attorney
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.550 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the there were a couple of concerns
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
that the the department had with the
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
language um added by representative Lyon
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
in her Amendment and one is the
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
reference to the date July 1st
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
2023 um that's factually incorrect as
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of work that was
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
done with a corrective action plan that
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of change to the
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
developmental Services system as of July
 
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.870 align:start position:0%
developmental Services system as of July
1st

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
2023 this issue is completely
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
independent of that um it is something
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
that had come up throughout waiver
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
amendments uh and so that that date just
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
isn't correct and so that that is part
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the concern the department had um and
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
also based on the language that was
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
received from CMS as to whether these
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
Services should be included in the
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
waiver or not and having this language
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
here um the department feels that having
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
a language of this nature in in a
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
statute has the potential
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
CMS take another look at this um and
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a that could be the potential
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
for some action on their part of course
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
no one knows if that would be uh taken
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
or not but the department just wanted to
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
point those two items out um for the
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration and again as
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
was stated at the previous hearing the
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
department is completely supportive of
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
the concept of of this bill and ensuring
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
that folks you know do have access to
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
Services representative Lon um thank you
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chman and thank you for providing
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
this I'm sorry I wasn't able to meet up
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
with you prior to discuss this but I
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
think it benefits the committee as a
 
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
whole um does CMS prevent the state from
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
choosing how to spend State funds to
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
support people here no this is this
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
would only be with respect to CMS only
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
has a say with respect to those on the
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
waiver so has a followup followup and so
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
as a followup if CMS has no say about
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
how we spend our state funds why would
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
spending State funds to cover something
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
that the CMS has said is no longer
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
coverable with CMS funds cause problems
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
with us with CMS so the risk is that the
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
the way in which these were provided
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
previously what what the state has been
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
told by CMS is that these were never
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to be provided on the waiver
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
yet they were for a number of years um
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
CMS has expressed a desire to look
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
forward with the state to look
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
prospectively on fixing that rather than
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
looking retroactively and so the concern
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
is references to there having had been
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
continued payment on the waiver for
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
these Services that's where the state
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
sees there is a potential for um action
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
on the part of CMS and as I said there's
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
no way to predict whether or not that
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
would happen um but that's the
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
concern another followup as another
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
followup um I recognize that concern but
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out if it's
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
more important to restore these services
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
to people who already had them first or
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
to worry about a potential question from
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
CMS when they already know that we're
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
moving forward and trying to get this
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
done with state only funds and something
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
else I'd like to point out this wasn't
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
um as if a curtain came down and
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
everything stopped these are the being
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed as people's service Agreements
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
are being reviewed so it's being looked
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
at kind of on a rolling basis um so as
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
people's service Agreements are coming
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
up if they had certain services in there
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
before when that's being renewed with
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
their team they're looking at it in the
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
context of what the waiver permits now
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
um and what CMS has said is allowed a so
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like I said it wasn't as if a
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
curtain came down and things stopped
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
overnight um I know it probably feels
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
that way to some people who were getting
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
their services and and went through the
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
renewal process and maybe have been told
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
those cannot be covered now um but I
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide that
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
clarification too as to how this has
 
00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:42.870 align:start position:0%
clarification too as to how this has
been

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
working let other people ask some
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
questions I might have one after
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I I actually have a
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
comment rather than a question so if
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
anybody else has questions
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative mer you've been very
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
patient over there thank you Mr
 
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
patient over there thank you Mr
chairperson

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairperson
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
a question on
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
the page two line
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
one I'm concerned because if you look at
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
the prior page the department shall
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
contract with one or more
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
organizations however then we go back
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
into page two on line one it will be the
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
department Health Human Services who
 
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
department Health Human Services who
shall

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
prioritize the payments versus the
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
organization who's been given the funds
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
I think it' be problematic because we're
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
getting into state not having the access
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
to what was being done yet we're
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
requiring them to do the prioritization
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
versus the organization that receives
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
the funds that's the first thing
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
secondly I do agree with the fact that
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
many of these things probably happened
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
after July 1
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
2023 and therefore we get into looking
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
at how we prioritize things so I'm not
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to prioritization what I'm
 
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the process we put in
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
place to who's going to do the
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
prioritization because the way it's
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
written today the money goes to the
 
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
written today the money goes to the
organization

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
but then the department has to instruct
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
the organization how to use the funds
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
when they don't have probably a lot of
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
the knowledge the agency has on how the
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds were utiliz so it's just a quirk
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the the way it's written
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative land did you want to
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
respond or um thank you um that's a good
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
point my question would be how the
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
department plans to make sure that these
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
services are first restored to those
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
people who had them denied and what your
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
plan is moving forward if we authorize
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
this without the language to make sure
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
that these the people who are already
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
participating in this are the first ones
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
who received this money so how would you
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
plan to do that in the department uh I
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have the subject matter
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
experts here with me today and I wasn't
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
prepared for that question so I do
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
apologize um but I think the department
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
understands the the question um and I
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
know in the previous iterations there
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
were when it was proposed to be uh a
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
long-standing fund there was a whole
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
provision about rulle making I think
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
that would have addressed that so um you
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
know I can see maybe potentially in the
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
contract cont with the agency that would
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
be administering this that kind of
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
language would be included the
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
department would include that with with
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
that vendor so that they knew everyone
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
kind of knew what the guidelines were
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
for providing those
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
Services representative Nagel and then
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh thank you Mr
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
when we originally saw this bill the
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
dollar figure was a million dollars now
 
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.910 align:start position:0%
dollar figure was a million dollars now
it's

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and I asked the question back
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
then do we know exactly what the total
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
cost of what we're paying out now is do
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
we know what that number is my
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is no um that this is an
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
estimation and I think it was arrived at
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
working with a representative from the
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
area agencies who have the best
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge about what is being paid out
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
and based on a survey of information
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
that they gave back this was based on
 
00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:45.030 align:start position:0%
that they gave back this was based on
that

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
estimate follow up so is that number
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient to cover everybody or not as
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
was suggested earlier today the
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
Department's understanding is that based
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the the information the area agencies
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
provided that as to what was being paid
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
out for these services that this figure
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient to cover those thank
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
Weber this isn't a question it's a
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
comment that I hope might get us further
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
forward I I'm remembering my French
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
teacher whose favorite phrase was
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
Coupe which means uh splitting a hair
 
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
into four different parts
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that first of all
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're very much on the same page about
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
what we want to do um and
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
secondly um looking at it from the point
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
of view of either of the two amendments
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds very much that as best we can
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
determine the people who have been
 
00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:49.190 align:start position:0%
determine the people who have been
receiving

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
Services could be covered by the
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
$500,000 um um payment
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds further to me like if the
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
department is having an agency
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
administer the department does simply
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
put in the request for proposal or or
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
the directive or the contract or
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
wherever it goes because I'm not an
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
expert on Contracting that
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
concern uh so I have been this uh
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself I have been
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
talked around into the proposal that I
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't care which one of these two passes
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
and if if um the second of the two is
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
the one that would get us to uh 20 to0
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
rather than 10 to 10 which I think is a
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
completely uh losing proposition on the
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
floor of the New Hampshire house and
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge that it is still
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to finance where as we all know
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
finance will do things to it that none
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
of us intended or expected and we'll
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
have to deal with that at the time um I
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
I want to just state that I would be
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
happy with going forward with either of
 
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.230 align:start position:0%
happy with going forward with either of
these

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
and that's just one person's opinion so
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Murphy thank
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh just a point of
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
clarification from my notes I took I
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
thought that relative to the cost going
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
from a million to half a million the
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
people that administer the program
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
thought that given the fact that it
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
would start halfway through the year it
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
would be probably only a quarter of that
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
as well so even just 250,000 but the
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
other question I had is in Dr I mean in
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's uh Amendment um
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
should on line 19 on page one should
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
that be June of 2024 because do you know
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro mentioned that
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
these are identical and that's only a
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
difference in the date so would that be
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
25 then representative Leon um thank you
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I actually
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make this effective
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
immediately and I didn't get the draft
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
back that had an effective immediately
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
date because if we're able to get it
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
through both bodies quickly and get it
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
signed let's not waste a a month or a
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
week or anytime getting this money and
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
getting these Services restored um if I
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
can ask sure um so my other question is
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we prioritize
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
this but the language that I had was not
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
correct uh if and we have a few other
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
bills to exact um would language along
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
the lines of contracts to distribute
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
These funds uh should require the
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
agencies um to First restore Services
 
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
before providing new services
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
or something similar to that work so
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we can know that what we're trying
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
to do is get people who already had
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
something that was approved um get them
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
taken care of first because it's going
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
to there's time and resource constraints
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
on everything if we already know that
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know the gentleman who was in the
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
bowling league the people who are
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
already receiving these Services we
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
already know it's helping so if we can
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that that happens first before
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have the resources to figure out
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
anybody who didn't take have them before
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be the most
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
aable one because it's not going to take
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
much work to reapo what had already been
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
paid but it will take time for people
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
who are establishing these these
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
programs is could there be language
 
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.990 align:start position:0%
programs is could there be language
about

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
that um I think there probably could be
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and you know if there is some
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
direction to the department I think
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
what's again what's difficult is these
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
are coming up as service Agreements are
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
being renewed so um I don't know if
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
there is a we the area agency experts
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
aren't here today um but I think the
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
department would need to turn to them to
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
say how because if the department
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't know you know if new budget
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
requests are coming in and they don't
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
have that it the department wouldn't
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily know oh you know this
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
individual had this before and now they
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that in their budget so I
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a good way to
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
gauge that um and the the
 
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
agencies have also been turning to their
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
family support councils in some
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
instances um who have authority they
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
they make up their you know they have
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
some rules they have to abide by but
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
they have policies and guidelines so
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
that for some people that were getting
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
the service it was in their service
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
agreement it wasn't approved when it was
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
renewed they've gone to their family
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
support Council seeking these funding
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
this funding and in many instances it's
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
the Department's understanding that the
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
Family Support councils have approved
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
that so for some folks there is a
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism for which they they have had
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
some continuity but I it's difficult to
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
know I don't know that there's a exact
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
metric to understand who had what and
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
when and what has changed um but I think
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
the department would certainly be
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
amendable to trying to work through that
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
um and and see what can be done
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair uh I offer to the committee the
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
following language the Department of
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services shall include
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
language in the contract with the
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
organization for that organization to
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
prioritize Services provided prior to
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
July 1st
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
2023 representative Lon I think that's
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
almost there it sounds like the July 1st
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
2023 but to provide services previously
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
offer um previously offered uh due to a
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
service reconsideration previously I I
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
what would the be the better thing
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
instead of the July 1st
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
2023 um maybe I'm trying to think on the
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
Fly here so pardon me but maybe in the
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
individualized budget that is what
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
authorizes the payment for services so
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
maybe if it was in someone's
 
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
individualized budget
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
previously so previously included in an
 
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.750 align:start position:0%
previously so previously included in an
individualized

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
individualized
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
budget is that close enough to get it to
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
finance I I I you know like I said the
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
department supports either and the
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
Department's intention was not to you
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
know was to provide information so that
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
people were aware and that if the
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
department were to raise concerns and a
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
further committee by full transparency
 
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
did not want folks to say well why
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
didn't you raise that concern earlier um
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
so that was the Department's intention
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
in in bringing any concerns forward
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative chapero yes I just want
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
to remind people that representative
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
Stringham who is sitting in the back of
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
the room and representative Edwards um
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
who came in to inquire about this bill
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
earlier are the two pro are the two
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill and they are both
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
on finance 3 and um it will get a you
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
know a kind of a a a
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
very thorough um going over when it gets
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
there so um I think we can make a
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
decision about which amendment to use
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
and move forward representative
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm still in the cutting the hair
 
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.150 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm still in the cutting the hair
in

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
four uh part I think that what
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's Amendment does is
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
Express pretty clearly
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
what um uh you know the cons takes care
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
of a lot of the concerns the people had
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
and while I would prefer the language of
 
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
the other one I'm I'm I think that this
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
does give a sense that what we're trying
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
to do is fill the Gap first and then if
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's any Splash over that's great and
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
we've been assured that this probably is
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay the other thing I want to remind
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
people um and I'm thinking of um
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon and saying while
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
we're still young
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh is that this is a temporary fill for
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
something which uh is now just going to
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
be a temporary till the end of this
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and then should be
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
addressed more comprehensively going
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
forward by the department uh in in the
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
next budget request and we hope that
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
they've heard very clearly our concerns
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
about the need but my suggestion would
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
be that perhaps this uh Amendment could
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
be withdrawn and the other Amendment
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
could be offered we could vote on it and
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
send it to finance where there could be
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
further refinements
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
necessary yes suggestion representative
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
Weber is to withdraw the motion in the
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
second on uh
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
0416 is that what your suggestion is or
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking only personally I
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
understand so representative Lon um
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman we do have several
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
other bills in front of us and I did
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
want to make this effective a upon
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
passage um the language the
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant suggested the
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
shall include language and the contracts
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
with the service providers to prioritize
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
Services previously included in
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
individualized budgets and changing it
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
to effective upon passage shouldn't take
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
long from OS so if we can withdraw the
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
motion and then move to another as soon
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
as it's printed I think we've already
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of our discussion and then
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to move forward I can send
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
that along right right now with both of
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
our names representative Merchant okay
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
and would you like to be on there as
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes sure and and I will agree to
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
withdraw my um motion to adopt okay and
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
the who made the
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
second okay okay so EXC me
 
00:52:13.559 --> 00:52:14.549 align:start position:0%
second okay okay so EXC me
representative

00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
McDonald is it possible to add one more
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
clarification to to what representative
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
Lon just referenced in the proposed
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
amendment I think you said contract with
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
service providers is it really meant to
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
be those the the contract that is in
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
section four of the proposed
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it is so should I just say in
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
the contracts to prioritize service or
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
should I use the language from section
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
four or I'm wondering if just referring
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
back to section four so it's clear which
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
contractors I I the the way you had
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
worded it gave me pause to think that
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
people might think it was a contract
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
with any service provider rather than
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
what was for administering these funds
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's why we're
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
woodshedding this right now so uh
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
include laying anguage
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
um let's see um in so and then that
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
would be in the contracts um designated
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
in sub paragraph 4 I believe that would
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
get the committee to where they were
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
get thank
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
you okay so uh the motion has been
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawn and the second has been
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
withdrawn uh if I'm understanding the
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
the sense of the committee we'll we uh
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
move on to the next bill and we'll come
 
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
back to 1593 shortly it is an early bill
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
so we do need to take action
 
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
today okay so pending the amendment
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
coming from OS we'll move on to hb1
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
1393 and and just before we move on Mr
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I may um our a researcher has
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
asked us that if it is at all possible
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
sense I'm sending it right in okay I'm
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
about to send it over with our names I
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that that the
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
sidebar that I had was uh possibly could
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
the report be written while we're
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
attending the arrival of the amendment
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
so that the report can be given and sent
 
00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:14.190 align:start position:0%
so that the report can be given and sent
in

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
um yes I I actually have already I've
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
already drafted um a report so um I was
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
trying to think ahead on that one so I
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
already have language and I'll make sure
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
it's accurate and correct
 
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
and actually if we could be doing the
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
same thing with 16 69% of merchant
 
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing that one
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
right uh new time or I don't think it
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
can be done too too soon but noon time
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
is acceptable I guess
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh anything else on um hb6
 
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.510 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh anything else on um hb6
1593

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
1593
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
FN okay we we'll revisit that shortly HB
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
1393 do I have a motion
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I'd like to make a
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
motion that this uh HB 1393 isn't
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate okay is there a
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
second I can second that or sorry
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber representative
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
Weber seconds representative Nagel do
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to a motion yes this
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
is very spontaneous but I will do my
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
best I'm actually on the State Health
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
assessment um and initiative committee
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
we actually had a very long sidebar
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on this particular Bill
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
earlier um just the other day um it's a
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
very complex process to create that
 
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
assessment and that initiative and
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of priorities that
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
we need to have a fair amount of I hate
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
to use the word wiggle room but wiggle
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
room um to decide what are priorities
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a really important
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
issue but there's also a lot of other
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
issues and I think to place this in
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
statute at or above other things is
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and that I think we need
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
to Le let that committee decide what the
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
priorities are and I already know that
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
this is a priority
 
00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
this is a priority
representative

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and and thank you
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel um I just I I agree
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
and the uh outcome if we were to put it
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
in statute would be that next year this
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
committee would have 47 or 78 or 132
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
other equally concerning conditions that
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
we would be trying to insert in statute
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
and the point of the plan is a balance
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
the point and and I think that if if in
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
writing the
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
report um the report writer could
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
include both how important the committee
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
members think this issue is and that the
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
issue has been brought
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
up uh in front of the commissions that's
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
the appropriate commission and it's
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
being taken into
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
consideration um and I'd be glad to work
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
with you on that if that's helpful later
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
um but I I think that uh if the report
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
States those things it it sort of
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies the intent of the committee
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a dismissal it's a referral
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate place and a statement
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
that uh action has started to be taken
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
and is is to be
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing representative Nagel yeah if I
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
could just add a followup to this if
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
you've got nothing better to do I
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
suggest you look at the website for this
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
program it's not about individual
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis it's about looking at the
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
whole person in four different
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
categories so I would add a factor of 10
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the potential priority list that we
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
could be dealing with um so but I
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
discussion okay if not I'll ask the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the r the motion is itl on
 
00:57:49.559 --> 00:57:51.230 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the r the motion is itl on

representative Lon um I'd move a to pass
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass is there a
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
second I'll second it who said that
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative McLean representative
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
McLean seconds representative Lon do you
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
want to speak to your motion um yes
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um we heard a lot
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
about the different characteristics of
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis whether it's grown under lights
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
or under natural light um just like
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
anything else inputs matter uh just like
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
if you have a stripped soil or a very
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
rich living soil you're going to get a
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
different product um I believe that
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
allowing them to operate an additional
 
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
cultivation location will help them to
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can have the supply
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's necessary and allowing this to be
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
a greenhouse I think brings beneficial
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh brings a lot of benefits to us you
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
know all of these are going to have to
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
comply with local zoning laws so we're
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
not stepping on any local control we're
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
just giving enabling legislation to
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
allow more options for the cultivation
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and especially given that the whole
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
landscape may be shifting moving forward
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
if um adult use um cannabis does become
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
a factor the more that um we can ensure
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
that the quality of product and um the
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
richness of product in the therapeutic
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis um is able to take advantage of
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
all the benefits of natural sunlight and
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
everything else in order to be um the
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
best match for people who need cannabis
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
as medicine as opposed to cannabis as um
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
something else that I think that that's
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
going to benefit them and help to keep
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
this program viable um because in other
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
states when there's been adult use
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
legalization in in Vermont the amount of
 
01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
people using the therapeutic program
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
actually cut in half because there were
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who were happy with an
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
offthe shelf shelf option so the more
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
that we can support the vibrancy and
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
offerings of the alternative treatment
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
centers to best meet the needs of
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
patients not recreational people I think
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
that this is good and this is moving
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
things forward in the
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
state other discussion representative
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman is the proud
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
number one of a 19 to1 vote on a
 
01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar bill but quite
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
different I actually support this bill I
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
like it that it's under the setting of
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
people that we know really know what
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
they were doing I've been to these
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
centers I see what they do I know how
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
smart they are they're phds in
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
Horticulture they're amazing people and
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a great solution for
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
a very very difficult problem because
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
these atc's I think are struggling a lot
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
more than we think they
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
are other discussion representative mlan
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair I I think how
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're almost 10 years in with
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
this program there were a lot of
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
security concerns up front before we
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
knew a lot we've had an opportunity to
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
see how those are manifested in other
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
states such as Maine so I I don't think
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
there there's a real deep concern on the
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
security side but also from the
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
perspective of cost um while we have a
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
very good product in New Hampshire
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
cost-wise um we're not as competitive
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
and so setting up an operation that will
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
help drive down the cost
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
makes it competitive and drives people
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
towards a legal Market um so I that
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
helps with harm reduction and other
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
things so I I think this is a good
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
struggling with this one honestly uh and
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
I I put in my notes and I remember it
 
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
from um the hearing is that the analysis
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the word
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
second kind of contradicts the word the
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
being used used in the actual bill
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
language of additional the word second
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
is very different to the word additional
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and so that was my concern then and I
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
do recall law enforcement uh letting us
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
know that they were not in favor of this
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
U because of how it would be hard to
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
manage for them so I'm I'm honestly
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
struggling with this one just full
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
transparency um but those are my two
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
discussion I seeing none I'll ask the
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%

amendment to that yes representative
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
Phillips is uh is pushing is bringing
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
this one around um with this um I think
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
we need to take a look at it and see
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
where we are um if we're not fully
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
satisfied with what we have let's get
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
some constructive comments and see what
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
we need um and and figure out how to
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
move forward with us if NE if if that's
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
the will of the committee okay we'll
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
take a look at the amendment is it ex
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
exactly and I apologize for speaking
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
before being recognized and before we
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
had the bill in front of us wasn't me
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
need to jump the
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
gun which
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
she hasn't actually made a motion yet
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
actually and if you'd like I can move
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'll tell you the number
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
in just a second um Amendment 2024
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
05778 Z second second representative
 
01:06:12.799 --> 01:06:14.230 align:start position:0%
05778 Z second second representative
kushman

01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
kushman
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
seconds and as it gets around we'll let
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
everybody take a look um and then my
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
question would be um to the chairman um
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill had worked
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
on this um Amendment and the question
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
would be if we would want her to walk us
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
through what changes were made so that
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
we can understand because uh this this
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
was a pretty big change in the bill so I
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
defer to the chairman on that
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay get it get the amendment fully
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
around and give it people a moment and
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
then representative Phillips will be
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
welcome to come to the witness
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
table question Mr chair oh yes
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative K is it normal that um we
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
would ever be given just like 5 minutes
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
time to just silently read something
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
because sometimes when somebody's
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
speaking you want to listen to them but
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
you also want to read it for yourself
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
and I can't do the both at the same time
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
so is that normal to do that something
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
like that uh it's Case by case there's
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
no formal procedure on that but if if we
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
want a couple three minutes to read this
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
through first I I would second um his
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
motion sure yeah let's take a moment to
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
read this through and then when you know
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
when let me know when you're ready and
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
then we'll ask representative Phillips
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
to come forward how does that work is
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:12:00.030 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
how's everybody
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
or no no go ahead if you need some more
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:13:20.310 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
Al sir
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative yeah representative PHS
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to walk us through this
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you all for for this and
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
for reading the amendment um
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative Emily Phillips Rockingham
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
7 Fremont New Hampshire so I went back
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
and I watched the you know two and a
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
half hours on this um hearing and I took
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
in all of the um feedback and I just
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
heard a lot that the original bill was
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming a little bit redundant so I
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
trimmed down basically the original Bill
 
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you have copies of the
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
original one it's probably hard to
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
determine what was cut but everything
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
that was removed from the original bill
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
I can go through what was changed but
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
the only thing that was added was one
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
condition that is a complication so um I
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
have my Google doc that I sent
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the major changes was the original
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
Bill asked to show parents considering a
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
circumcision the restraint board and
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
some um tools used for the procedure and
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
instead we switched it out with an image
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
of so that the um providers didn't have
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
to re sanitize a restraint board or have
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
one dedicated just to show parents prior
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
to the um procedure I removed
 
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.709 align:start position:0%
to the um procedure I removed
[Music]

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
um uh no health care provider shall
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
solicit any parent for circumcision
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
procedure that was originally in there
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
um there was a 25-year Clause asking the
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals to hold on to the original
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
consent form for 25 years I remove that
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
from what I'm hearing EMR um records are
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
forever so that was
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I removed a sentence that
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
said uh since the normal physiological
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
condition for boys to have non-
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
retractable foreskin prior to puberty
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
and often until late teenage years
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers shall not use a
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of fimosis in order to solicit
 
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:13.990 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of fimosis in order to solicit
a

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision I changed um circumcision
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
is associated with between 20 and 47
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
known complications I took that out and
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
just said many cuz who's going to argue
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
how many known complications there are I
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
added in Buried penis syndrome into a
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
reason I'm sorry a um a uh injury after
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
a circumcision or a condition that can
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
be caused by circumcision buried penis
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
syndromes in there um I took out the
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
statement which I thought was personal
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh your son may want an intact penis and
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
decision to have a circumcision denies
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
him his body integrity and autonomy
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
which he may resent when he matures I
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
took that out because obviously
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's already kind of suggesting that
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
this is not medically
 
01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.229 align:start position:0%
this is not medically
necessary

01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
um I took out the section it was a large
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
section that said there is no proven
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
medical benefits following newborn
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh because I think that is
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
um disputed that there may be a small
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
medical I'm not sure so I took all that
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
out because it was just carry-on and
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
redundant uh the actual medical need for
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision in adults is as low as six
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
in 100,000 guess again you can't put in
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
statistics there because it could change
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
over time right
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
um um took out the non-surgical options
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
for alternative prophylactics
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
prophylactics and treatment of potential
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
problems are those that are tissue
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
sparing receiving this consent form does
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
not mean the circumcision is recommended
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
parents May free CH free freely choose
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
to not circumcise their son by
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
withholding signature and returning the
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
form unsigned that's redundant so I took
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
that out and then um I took out the
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
other section um lastly that said prior
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
to approving circumcision consent forms
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
and intact care guides the department
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
shall provide copies of such forms at no
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
cost to register nonprofit advocacy
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
organizations again we we took that out
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
that was redundant and then I changed
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
the uh effective date from 60 days to
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2025 because I'm assuming
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to take some time to get
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
get everybody on board so that's the
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
gist I mean I know it's a lot to
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
um talk about and consider but I think
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
that it was overwhelmingly clear that
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
informed consent is not happening
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
consistently and that people want it in
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so thank you for your time
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
and consideration of the amendment
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking questions
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
and doing all this work um maybe I
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
missed it on line 22 you have uh section
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
F there solicitation the
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
definition um but I'm not seeing any
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
corresponding language in the bill
 
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
regarding solicitation um what's the
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
point of having the definition if
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
there's if it's not later referred to to
 
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
or is it referred to when I just missed
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
it that's a that's a great catch because
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay I see another hand up um
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro did you have a
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
hand up that was The Identical question
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
that I was going to ask okay two minds
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the same direction other
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King again
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this question should be
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
directed to the one testifying or the
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee in general um but I'm just
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
curious um maybe the doctors in in the
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
house can help me uh understand this is
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
it normal to put informed consent
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
language in
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
statute um and if not when we do have
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
informed consent
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
mandates who do we trust to write the
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
informed consent language when it's
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
mandated so we put a mandate something
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be informed consent who are we
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
trusting to write that language if it's
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
not in the statute thank you
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
representative Nel since I just got
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
handed 15 different informed consents
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
that I've written in the past that I
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
need to re-review and have back to our
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
um um institution in the next three days
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
I feel very compelled to answer that
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
question um I've written dozens of
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
informed consents in my career
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
historically way back when I started it
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
was just me I did it but nowadays you
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
have to go through an Institutional
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
review group they have to okay it make
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
sure it's legally acceptable things like
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
that to actually put an in informed
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
consent of this type in statute doesn't
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
happen this would be extremely unique
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
and um I'll leave my comments on that
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
practice for
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
later representative kushman thank you
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um there are some uh
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
informed consent requirements uh that
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
I've come across in in statutes and
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rules particularly the
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
one that um stands out to me now but I
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
know that I've seen others um are the
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for vaginal bursts after
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
cesarian section um in the Midwifery
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
rules so there are some but they do
 
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.950 align:start position:0%
rules so there are some but they do
um

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
they they defer
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the department to make the form so
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
the the department does create the form
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
just like this one um and their
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines they defer they basically the
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
provider gives a information sheet
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's written by the New England um
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
Quality neonatal Network I think is what
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's called probably not probably
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
butchered it but um they give the the
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
fact sheet Pro that an organization
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
creates and then the department has the
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
consent form that is printed and and the
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber and then
 
01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.629 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber and then
representative

01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
Nagel I was just going to point out the
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
difference between being in statute and
 
01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
um the statutes are created by us
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
lawmakers and yes we have a few docs and
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
we have some advanced practice nurse
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
practitioners and some other people with
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
very good qualifications but most of us
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't have any of those qualifications
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
and the point of Ru making is to
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
delegate to those people who have
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
significantly more
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh the creation of um forms
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
that might
 
01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
be um that that need specialized
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge in order to create
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
them however that said I'm still I still
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the actual drafting
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the Lang language of a consent form
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
the specific language because things
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
change and sometimes it's quicker to
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
change a statute than it is to change
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
rule um if if if the legislature has
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines then that's one thing uh but
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
to actually put specific language
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
in uh in any case I think for me is a
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
deal breaker or at least I haven't seen
 
01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
one yet that I would agree was the right
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
go representative Neland then
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative play thank you Mr
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
chairman you pretty much said almost
 
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
everything I wanted to say um the only
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
thing that I would add as part of being
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
in this job I had the very unpleasant
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
job of looking through most of the
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
medical rules and I'm not aware that
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's any informed consent
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
specifically in the medical on Board of
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
Medicine rules um what they do refer to
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
is to the a guide of Ethics is to how
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
you create and the requirement that you
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
do use an informed
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
consent representative Lon and then
 
01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
consent representative Lon and then
representative

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
Merchant as well um thank you Mr
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think informed consent
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
actually is a really important core part
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
of this decision there's two different
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
methods of informed consent there's
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
provider Centric informed consent where
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
you need to tell the person what a
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
provider thinks they need to know then
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
there's patient Centric informed consent
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
where you need to tell the person what
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
the patient wants to know sometimes
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
those aren't the same and it's actually
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
a really really big difference because
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're moving towards sort of a
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
more um homogenized medical system one
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
where there's more focus on herd
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
management than individuals and that's
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
an actual term so I'm not trying to be
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh trying to be rude by saying that but
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's actually one of the terms that's
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
used in some of of the literature and as
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
you move away from a patient specific
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
informed consent if there is more of a
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
standardization and a deference to
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
experts there's a really big chance that
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
people in the state will be harmed I
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
think that it's actually really
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
important for us to try and work forward
 
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
towards this we probably can talk some
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
more but I I'd be willing to withdraw my
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
motion of the amendment and then maybe
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that um anybody who wants to
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
work on it I'd be happy to to talk to
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
people we can figure out if it should be
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee or if I should sort of do
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
this ad hoc with people um but I think
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
that patient Centric informed consent
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
especially for something like this is
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
key I was in the room with all three of
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
my sons I have a feeling that may not
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
have been three if my husband had been
 
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
in the room so thank you representative
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant and then representative
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
chairman there's a couple of concerns I
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
have with the amendment if you go to
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
page two on line
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.790 align:start position:0%
page two on line
24

01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
it talks about a religious circumcision
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
in a non-medical
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
facility many times you may have a
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
person doing a religious ceremony inside
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
of the medical facility so that could
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
occur and right now that would not be
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
allowed um you can have the rabbi going
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
to the hospital to do it there versus
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
doing it outside of the facility so
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's a concern I have number two on
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
line 25 page two the department has no
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over licy that's the Board
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
of Medicine the Board of Pharmacy the
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing they're the ones that
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
have the jurisdiction over that license
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
not the department themselves number
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
three if you look at lines 16 through
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
22 if you have a situation where you
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
have two
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
parents in two different households
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
known as a
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
divorce who rules because you could have
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
one parent who wants to do it as
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
physical custody of the child in medical
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
care of that child but the other parent
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason opposes it just to
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
be what if you will that is not dealt
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
with here uh that means you have to go
 
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
to the court and try to figure out who
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction over this which is a
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
problem number three or four I do think
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
that it's important that the
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
parents have the appropriate education
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
not the consent
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
form it's the education that's critical
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
here not so much that they signed a
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
consent form so I'd be more than glad to
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
work with representative Lon to try to
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
find ways to thread the needle to
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
achieve what we're trying to achieve
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
that parents first and foremost have the
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge to make the appropriate
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
decision and also if you look at on the
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
page most of what's here is all about
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
the risk and it's very negatively
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
written and when you get into the
 
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:48.870 align:start position:0%
written and when you get into the
consent

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
form if I was to read something like
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
that I'll tell you if you read a package
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
insert and a drug you would never take
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
another one in your entire life that's
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
why we have medical providers to help us
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
understand what language is that's put
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
into the package insert for a
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
drug this is kind of the same thing
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
where all of a sudden you have a
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
situation where you hear all the
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
negative things about whatever it is and
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
nothing about the positive side so I
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
think for those reasons it needs to be
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
amended I think we need to work on it
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
collectively and I'd be more than glad
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
not more than glad I'd be willing
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm already on too many things now but
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be willing to work with um Lon or
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the committee Mr chairman
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
um to try to find a way to thread the
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
needle representative Murphy and then
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm not sure we're in the asked
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
the presenter questions yet or just
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
discussed but I I wasn't going to ask a
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
question I was going to make a comment
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
more than anything else and um I I would
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
say that over the last 40 plus years I
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
have probably obtained over 10,000 at
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
least at least 10,000 consents I would
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
say in that period of time I've probably
 
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
used over 10 or so different consent
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
forms and every one of them was a
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
generic form informed consent with a
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
between a provider or surgeon or even if
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're given an injection in the office
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
is between the provider surgeon in my
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
case with the patient it's a
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
conversation it's probably the only
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that really keeps you out
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the courtroom if something goes wrong
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
so I totally and fully embrace the
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
concept of informed consent I think that
 
01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
put in any language in Statue or into
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
rules especially if you try to make up a
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
specific surgical consent for every
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
procedure that we do is going to be
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
terribly problematic it's a very Dynamic
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
you know process informed
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
consent things change as I said before I
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
used over 10 different consent forms in
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
my career and over 10,000 I'm sure that
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
I've gotten myself um I I I find it hard
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
to imagine why in this procedure
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
specifically we would want to actually
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to show them images of tools that
 
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
we use or you know even bring the tools
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
in certainly it's an improvement to show
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
an image but certainly it's terribly
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
problematic to even do that and the
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
reason I say that having done a number
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
of procedures over decades these
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
procedures change often times and if you
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
were to do say a total knee replacement
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
or total hip the instruments that we use
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
change dramatically the implants that we
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
use change dramatically
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
and to put in the quest to put into
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
statute or into any of these form
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
informed consents images showing the
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
tools that we use I'm sorry I I I would
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
find that I would probably say that the
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
majority or not the majority a large
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
number of patients who would otherwise
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
benefit tremendously from a joint
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
arthoplasty meaning replacement would be
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
scared to death if I showed them the
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
instruments that were used that looked
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
like they come from a hardware store so
 
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
you know drills saws cement glue you
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
know processes that we use the weight of
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
the processes that we use these are all
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to show a patient
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then get really a truly informed
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
consent so I I have a very hard time
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
understanding at all putting informed
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
consent language into statute or into
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
rules because of the Dynamics of it
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
because of the complexity of an informed
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
consent and because it is probably
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
something that we do and we take as a
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
very important part of our conversation
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
with any patient to try to inform them
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
as best we can because I can guarantee
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
you that in all the informed consents I
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
got I could never ever have included
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensively every potential risk or
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
benefit that they may perceive that they
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
have or that they encountered during a
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
procedure so I I would find this
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
terribly problematic in any way shape or
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
form to do this especially um the
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent part of it thank you
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nagel and then
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm just going to be blunt
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
and say that there is no way I would
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
support the amendment or the bill with
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
that said what they did that was really
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
important was bring up this whole notion
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
of informed consent I really
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the discussion that
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
representative merch and representative
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
Lon have come up and I do want to point
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
out the whole concept informed consent
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
and the doctor patient
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
relationship has changed dramatically in
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
my 35 years and your 40 years when we
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
started it was basically you know we
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
dictated to the patient what he did and
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
they did it without question it's not
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
like that anymore we use a mutual
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
consent uh participation model now and
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
what's really scary fun and everything
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time is I swear patients
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
come in now and they know more about
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing than I do and our
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
discussions have gone from me informing
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
them as the risks and benefits to me
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
discussing information and
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
misinformation on what they know and
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's to me that's really exciting but
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's the way things are right now and I
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
think that we need to seriously sit down
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
as a group and I'm not sure this
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is the right way to do it
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
but I think we really do need to sit
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
down have a vehicle and talk about where
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
we're going with informed consents in
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
the future because I I I don't disagree
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
with their point that it's flawed right
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
now and I think we can make it a lot
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
better but I don't think that this
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
legislation for a specific thing is the
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
right way to do it and with that said I
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
have three pages of talking points of my
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill so I don't want
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
to bore you with that but um I do think
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
that that recom suggestion was an
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly good one representative
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
Weber I I was going to just say that I
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
think um the the one thing that I talk
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
about people who know a little bit about
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
everything and come and tell docs about
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
it but the the thing that I was really
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
interested to learn recently and a
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
conversation about this bill is of
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
course something that had not occurred
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
to me I'm not a parent so I haven't done
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff um but the OBGYN who
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
is the person who is treating the mom
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
through her pregnancy is often not the
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
person who is doing the surgery on the
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
Infant and it is the surgeon doing the
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
surgery on the Infant who must obtain
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
the informed consent because I was
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
thinking you know we just need to make
 
01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
people focus on talking about this
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
earlier which I think is a concept that
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
all of us kind of grasp so I too come
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
down on the side of uh first of all I I
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
find a lot of the the language in here
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
um bordering on offensive but um I um
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
also acknowledge the need for education
 
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
and the need for dialogue and the need
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh more emphasis on the informed part of
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
the phrase informed
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
consent um so that having been said I uh
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
don't have any problem with people
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
working on something that's going to be
 
01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
about education but if we're going to be
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
about consent forms or or specifics
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
about consent uh that's going to be a
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
hard no for me just so I don't have
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
anybody losing time over it and the more
 
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
I listen to the discussion here the more
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
I wonder if this bill might not be a
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle for True interim study uh to
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
talk about the consent issues that I
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
think all of us
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
recognize are very real and and needing
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
addressed so I just throw that out there
 
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
as a thought representative McLean and
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
then representative pero yeah thank you
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and you know I I have enormous
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
respect for the doctors on on this
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee and uh the the fact that it is
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult to to put specific
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
language into law and I kind of support
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
that sentiment uh but the concern I have
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
was that the testimony being given
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing was so
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
compelling that you have people who had
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
just given birth who are having a form
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
that form should have been presented to
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
them weeks before so um so maybe the
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
solution is not to put it into statute
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
but the existing system it's not just
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
about what's in the form it's about the
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
mode of delivery and and that's very
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
important so um if we are going to
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
interim study it I think it should
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely be a real interim study I
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
agree uh this language is problematic
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
and probably you know representative
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
Weber the reason that the language is
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
maybe borderline offensive is because of
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
the experiences out of which it was born
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
and so I think we have to take that into
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
account and and be very sympathetic to
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
that so um I I would definitely um if we
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
are going to interim study it think that
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's something we have to give some
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
serious and honest consideration to and
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts representative
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I was affected by some of the
 
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um especially people who um
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
came and talked about not thinking about
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
this very very much um there being an
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
assumption that this is what happens to
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
all boys and then um those people maybe
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
had some ongoing medical um
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
complications and I was very sympathetic
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
to those stories um and I feel
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely that circumcision is an
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
elective surgery that people should be
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
educated people should have all the
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
information they need to make an
 
01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.830 align:start position:0%
information they need to make an
informed

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
decision that being being said um if
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
people continue to work on this bill I
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
think there's
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
a there's not only for me there's not
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
only a change from informed consent to
 
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
education that has to take place but I
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that people who came um some
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the people who came to testify were
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
saying there's an assumption um a a bad
 
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.750 align:start position:0%
saying there's an assumption um a a bad
assumption

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
that little boys should be
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
circumcised and um and this is truly
 
01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.109 align:start position:0%
circumcised and um and this is truly
elective

01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
elective
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
um people shouldn't assume that doctors
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um assume that they can just
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
stick something in front of the um the
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
the mom and get her to sign it and um
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
but what I think this bill the original
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
Bill does and what this um Amendment
 
01:37:47.239 --> 01:37:48.910 align:start position:0%
Bill does and what this um Amendment
does

01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
equally is it creates the opposite
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
opposite bias um the bias in this bill
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
is that um this is a very dangerous
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
um procedure and you better watch out
 
01:38:05.229 --> 01:38:05.239 align:start position:0%
you better look at these um tools that
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
are going to be used to do it um I would
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
say that just the term potential
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
benefits and inherent risks
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
um is you know is a biased way of
 
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
talking about this um there are
 
01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
potential benefits and potential risks
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
as well um I understand that the some of
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
the um testimony was compelling to some
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
a this was just a slice of people who
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
came to testify about this bill I mean
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
there was no testimony from anybody um
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
who was circumcised when they were a
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
young child like I was and have had a
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
perfectly normal life life and um a very
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
satisfactory life in regards to health
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
and various things so I think that
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
um this bill was brought with people
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
with a particular bias and we heard
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had a particular bias
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
and by all means if we're going to work
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
on something and pass something we don't
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
want it to have the opposite bias we
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
want it to be um informed scient I ific
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
neutral um we want to create a culture
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
where people can really learn and think
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
for themselves and make their own
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
informed decision um but this I find to
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
be dangerous to tell you the truth
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I just wanted to
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
issue small apology for my remarks
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
earlier um and I wanted to make it clear
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
that I too
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
found a great deal of the testimony that
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
we heard very very compelling and I do
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
not in any way want to minimize that I
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
just don't think that this is the
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate solution but I have to say
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
um the the testimony was very compelling
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
um I will also say that my professional
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
development came through divorce work
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
and one is equ
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
informed by the fact that uh there are
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
some horrible divorces out there but and
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
those are the ones you hear about you
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't hear about the vast majority of
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
parents who suck it up talk to each
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
other uh make compromises for the
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
benefit of their children and go on to
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
be wonderful wonderful wonderful
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
co-parents um in a new setting uh so I
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that apology and
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that I wasn't minimizing uh
 
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we heard thank you
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to Second what you said
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
because it kind of began what I wanted
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
to say but I I feel compelled to say
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
stuff I wrote here earlier that I wasn't
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
going to say till later but
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
um you you nailed it I mean this is a
 
01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
very biased presentation um when I
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
started you're not going to read three
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
pages are you yeah no no no no that
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
never mind I'm not reading three pages
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell tell you is the
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
following I mean I spent an awful lot of
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
time on this issue I have no idea why
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
but you know to clarify what you just
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
said the satisfaction rate of males
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
who've had circumcision is 99% the
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
complication rate which was really
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
misrepresented is in a study in Israel
 
01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.709 align:start position:0%
misrepresented is in a study in Israel
was

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
0.34% in the United States it's between
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
1 to 2% and most of the complications
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
are very shortterm and self-limited and
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
as one of my as Dr Conway who presented
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
here acknowledg the one gentleman had a
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
very serious complication and in the
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
study in Israel they had one but those
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
are extremely rare and and and I think
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
we got to be really careful about
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
biasing reality the other thing you
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
might want to do if you got nothing
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
better to do is I found a website
 
01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
totally by accident of people that are
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
angry at their parents for not having
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
had them circumcised because all the
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
problems they've had from being
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
uncircumcised so there are definitely
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
two sides of this story but we're
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
finding out that 9 9% of us are in the
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
middle and we're just
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
fine representative L did you have a
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
comment representative kushman thank you
 
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I um well I I think that
 
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
this discussion is very important and
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
obviously um there's a lot more to hash
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
out here I'm going to withdraw my motion
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to move interim
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
study is is a second withdraw um sorry I
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
made the motion and I already offered to
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw it so I will withdraw it um and
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
yes I will withdraw my second and if I
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
may just um I just want to say that this
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
is clearly um a a complex issue there
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
was a lot of compelling testimony um
 
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
this is the only routinely done elective
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
surgery on infants and that's why it's
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
the gravity is what it is um there's
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
nothing else like this
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's it's special and
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be really considered as far as
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
that goes um I would like to see this
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
studied over the summer and I would be
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
happy to participate and I think this
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
broader informed consent conversation
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
definitely needs to um continue as well
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so representative
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
kushman you're moving inm study is there
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
a second second representative Weber
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
seconds any discussion on the motion for
 
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
inim study representative Murphy thank
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
I I question about interim study on this
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill specifically because it it
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
perpetuates the concept of focus on
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
circumcision alone I would argue that
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh representative Shapiro
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned and people have mentioned
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
elective it is an elective procedure and
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
that it does not have to be done
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
emergently but it's not elective in the
 
01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
sense that you need your total joint
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
replac and we can talk about it three
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
months ahead of time and then decide to
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
do it once you get Beyond about a week
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
or 10 days after the child is born The
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
increased risks are are there with
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
circumcision so not I wouldn't call it
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
elective I wouldn't call it emergent I
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
would call it in a sense somewhat
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
semi-urgent a decision needs to be made
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
so a point of clarification there only
 
01:44:33.149 --> 01:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
um if I were to change the word here so
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this the concept of
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
interim study and if I were to change
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
the word circumcision procedure to any
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
other procedure we do we would be doing
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
the same thing I I think there's two
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
issues going on here one is the concept
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the circumcision whether it's
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate whether people like it or
 
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
not I I take a offense not offense I
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
take I question the word Cosmetic in a
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
procedure that does have in many in
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
Cleveland Clinic studies and other
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
studies that does have some very
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
definite therapeutic benefits so it's
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
not only cosmetic um but I would also
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
argue that there are two parallel tracks
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
here one is the concern we have about
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
informed consent I agree with that maybe
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
we ought to work on that I'm not sure I
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
would ever get to the point of
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislating or putting in statute inform
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
consent language necessarily but that's
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
a separate issue from the procedure
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
itself and so I would
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion or my thought would be that
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
this becomes in my mind an
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
it for both the amendment and the bill
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
itself and if somebody wants to bring up
 
01:45:31.629 --> 01:45:31.639 align:start position:0%
a separate and a future bill regarding
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
informed consent that could be done
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
later later date so I I'm still not sure
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
that interim study in my mind is the
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
best way to go if the presumption is
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we're still working on the concept
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
that circumcision is a procedure that
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
has to be focused on in this bill thanks
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
other representative
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.550 align:start position:0%
other representative
Weber

01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
the other option that might be available
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
to us that is available to us if if
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
people are interested in it would be for
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
the chair to create an ad hoc
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of this committee to study
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
the broader issues of
 
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
consent which it's within your power to
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
do and I don't know whether that would
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
get us farther forward on this bill or
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
not and and the two are not mutually
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
exclusive we could
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh either itl or interim study this bill
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
and still have uh a committee to study a
 
01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
broader issue if that's the will of the
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
chair and the committee representative
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
TZ representative
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
you so I'm I'm sitting here with a few
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
lenses on one is I train I'm a family
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
doc I did over 200 deliveries in
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
residency and I practiced in a place
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
where it was not sort of the culture of
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
the families that we served uh to have
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
circumcisions so while a few happened um
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
it you know it it was a parental
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
preference thing and nobody was
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
solicited you might get asked right but
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
you weren't uh lobbied so so some some
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the connotation that is hard for me
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
to relate to because I don't currently
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
practice right now here um and so that's
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
just a wondering I have as to like how
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
how is this how did this come to be
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about an elective
 
01:47:27.679 --> 01:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about an elective
parental

01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
parental
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
Choice uh and then the issue of informed
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
consent um representative Murphy I
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
really appreciated your elaboration on
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
how it's a conversation and in current
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
times it is patient
 
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
Centric right and I just want to remind
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
us that there is a whole like a lot of
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
science and research to how to make
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
informed consent which may seem here
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
really easy in Black and White how to
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
make that better so there's a a lot that
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
goes into it's not just what gets shared
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's sort of the the context The
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
People's State what they remember might
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
vary and so it's not been easy over many
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
years to try to improve informed consent
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying it's good or bad I'm
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
just saying like it's a it's a it's not
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
something can just legislate um or
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
create a form and that takes care of it
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
all so what I've heard is that there's a
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
concern that there's not education
 
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
happening I checked in with some OB
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
providers and and they'll say they
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
mention it you know it gets mentioned
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
and during the course of prenatal care
 
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:38.679 align:start position:0%
that if you're having a boy this will be
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
something you want to think about so if
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
the concern is that that all parents who
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
are aware of the gender of their
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
expected baby have never stopped to
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
think about what they would want to do
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
when the time comes then maybe we focus
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
on an education campaign or something
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
else that could easily be done out of a
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
public health department that is not
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
about legislating um the practice of
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
medicine um so I I think I think that's
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
it other discussion representative Lon
 
01:49:14.589 --> 01:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and I want to
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank the members of this committee for
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
talking about how important informed
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
consent is I think our larger disc
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
session of informed consent should
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
actually not address this bill but
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
should address House Bill 1280 which has
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
been presented in front of this
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee on February 7th um which has
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
to deal with informed consent um I think
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
that this is this is an area that I
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
think does warrant further study whether
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
or not we're making sure that there's
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
education there are some cultures where
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's assumed that you do some cultures
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
you assume that you don't and there's
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
some people where it's a religious right
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
so um I believe that interim study would
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
be a good path forward if we if that
 
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
does doesn't pass I'd suggest that we
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
hold off and move this one to March 6th
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
um so that anybody who wants to bring a
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
different Amendment could buy a March 6
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
Executive session if interim St he
 
01:50:03.629 --> 01:50:03.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass but um I I think we're
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
probably right for a vote given that
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this pretty
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
thoroughly any final discussion on
 
01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
this seeing none okay the motion is

yes

01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay representative kushman you'll do
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
you is somebody going to write a
 
01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:54.669 align:start position:0%
you is somebody going to write a
Minority

01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
n okay all right so you're doing I'm
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
doing against I uh interim
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
study I I think the issue may be that
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the people who voted in the minority may
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
have done so for a number of different
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
reasons um which are mutually exclusive
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
but perhaps somebody writing The
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
Minority Report might want to reference
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that there were various reasons
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
way no thank you all right
 
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel you'll write The
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
Minority Report on that representative
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
Mel you'll write the minority
 
01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro does The Minority
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
supporting I'm sorry yeah the minority
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
report would have to give the
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
alternative like a to pass or IPL or and
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
and that may be a problem because I
 
01:52:59.709 --> 01:52:59.719 align:start position:0%
think some of the people might have been
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
wanting a to pass and some might have
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
been wanting itl right can we have more
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
than one Minority Report I don't think
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of that I don't I've
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
never seen it so I I have no idea how to
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
square that Circle there is only one
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
Minority Report required we had another
 
01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:17.719 align:start position:0%
bill where there was a desire for
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that we include that
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
there were a variety of different
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
options presented for this bill which
 
01:53:31.149 --> 01:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
included an ad hoc committee um you know
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
a broader legislative committee or just
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
itl the bill in total or whatever I but
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
I I think we need to include all those
 
01:53:41.229 --> 01:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
things sure I I agree the problem is
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
that we will also the clerk will insist
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
on whether the recommendation is itl or
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and I'm not sure or ought
 
01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
to pass with Amendment all of which are
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
possibilities we don't know um we don't
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
know representative kof
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
fall uh thank you and thank you
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for pointing out
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that yes some of us did vote
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
against this not because we wanted to
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
itl but because we wanted to OTP having
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
said that I think that I am in the
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
minority of the minority in that view
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
therefore I I am comfortable if the
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
Minority Report presents an alter motion
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
of itl because I do believe perhaps
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
incorrectly um I would encourage others
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
to speak up if they if they share my
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
view let's put it that way um otherwise
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's safe for us to assume that
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the majority of the minority um
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
would prefer an itl motion so that if
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
OTP so that that if interim study fails
 
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
that would be the default U motion
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's made on the
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
floor so
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
now I lost
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
you you're writing an itl report
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
Minority Report so The Minority Report
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
is recommending itl and the I would
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
certainly The Minority Report is
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
recommending itl the majority report is
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
recommending in from the study right and
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
my you mean my request is that that
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
Minority Report should mention that not
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
everybody who voted in the minority
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
agrees with the itl rec
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm writing itl the bill period not itl
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
interim study yeah and and what you're
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to do is exactly what uh
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt said uh people who
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
voted against interim
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
study voted against it for a number of
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
reasons some wanting to itl the bill
 
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
entirely some perhaps wanting a passage
 
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
with an
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
amendment and then you
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
say you you know we had to pick a we had
 
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
to pick a a recommendation so it seemed
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
like more of the people were on the itl
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
side rather and I'm this is not the
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
right kind of language but these are the
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
points you're going to get in there is
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
is that um um people were in
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
disagreement about what the actual
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation should be so the report
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
should honor that but we we we are
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
required to pick one or the other and I
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
think that representative kofalt and I
 
01:56:24.589 --> 01:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for it um was was pretty
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
explicit in saying you know more of the
 
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
minority was for itl than not to pass
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
and we had to pick one can I say that if
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
that because I don't know that we didn't
 
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
actually have a
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
vote I think that's king of Bridge to
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
Star to say that the fact is that
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
however you explain it yeah there will
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
have to be a
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation it will have to be either
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass ought to pass with
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment which will have to have an
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
amendment number and we haven't voted on
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
any amendments or
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
itl so uh you don't have to be terribly
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
specific about it nor do you have to you
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't have to make assumptions I think
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing that everybody's agreed
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
on is that it's important to say
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the people who were not in favor of
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
interim study were also not NE
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily United in what they thought
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
ought to happen with the bill
 
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.149 align:start position:0%
ought to happen with the bill
representative

01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman and I think
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
if if if there were a large body of of
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
um people in the minority who agree with
 
01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
my position I think we would have heard
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
from them by now so I I think it's very
 
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
safe to say that most of the minority
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
agree with the itl position
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else on uh 170
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
6 we clear where we going okay all right
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
now let's revisit uh hb1 1593 FN at this
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
point uh again it's an early Bill we do
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
need to get it resolved we have received
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
the latest Amendment from a
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%

01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%

01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
2024-25

01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
2024-25
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
193 is there a
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
second representative McLean seconds
 
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative L do you want to speak to
 
01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:25.639 align:start position:0%
your motion um thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
this was delivered through uh from s
 
01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
doing a heroic job getting it to us so
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
quickly it includes that se set language
 
01:58:35.709 --> 01:58:35.719 align:start position:0%
that we had if you flip to the back page
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:38.679 align:start position:0%
Services shall include language in the
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
contracts designated in subp paragraph 4
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
to prioritize Services previously
 
01:58:45.149 --> 01:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
included in individualized budgets and
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
it has an effective date upon passage um
 
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why we I had the date change
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
the this current fiscal year so that we
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
can get these Services back so I I think
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
this is what we had I don't know if we
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
need discussion or if we're ready for a
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.669 align:start position:0%
get they're
coming

02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
you all right and you gave her a th I
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
you all right and you gave her a th I
did

02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.549 --> 02:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
this amendment will be easier reading
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
one okay representative Nagel would you
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion um yes I I
 
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
mean I just want to follow up on the
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that I originally provided on
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um there's three parts to the
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
bill the first part defines electronic
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
medical records the second part is what
 
02:05:33.069 --> 02:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
I call the um the provider um protection
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
portion which is number two the part
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
that we're striking with the amendment
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
is part three which is the patient
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
protection provision um when we talk
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
about the bill I'll discuss this all in
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
Greater detail as to why these are
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
important but um after talking with
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
stakeholders it became quite apparent
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
that number one is that what I wanted to
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish in three is to some extent
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
already in federal and local state
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
statute um my belief and that of my
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
patience and my observations is that it
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work um what I wanted to do was
 
02:06:08.109 --> 02:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
create something that worked it became
 
02:06:10.589 --> 02:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
apparent that this won't accomplish that
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
and what we wanted to do was strike it
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
from the bill and have a discussion
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
probably longwinded over the summer to
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
come up with something that's more
 
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.549 align:start position:0%
come up with something that's more
workable

02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
workable
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
amendment see no other
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
discussion so the motion is ought to
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
pass then on 2024 hyen
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%

02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
to make a a motion out to pass on um HB
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
1604 as amended by the
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendment okay any uh is there a
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
second representative Le on seconds uh
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to a motion sure
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
um I mean I gave a pretty in long-winded
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill before I
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
don't know that I want to add much more
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
to that but um the first part is is is a
 
02:08:16.589 --> 02:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
definition and I really feel strongly
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to put terms in
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
legis stat you need to Define what
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so that's why the
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
first part has a definition which did
 
02:08:26.589 --> 02:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
not really appear in statute prior to
 
02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:29.559 align:start position:0%
this um the second part is is intended
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
to be um to provide protection to
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
doctors and I'm just going to give you a
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
brief story but I met with a Democrat
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
Governor of which state I won't mention
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago and um he asked me a
 
02:08:44.589 --> 02:08:44.599 align:start position:0%
question about the Affordable Care Act
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
and he asked me what did I think about
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
it and since we weren't meeting to talk
 
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't really prepared and I certainly
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't read the 2,000 page version of it
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
um and he looked at me and he said it's
 
02:08:59.549 --> 02:08:59.559 align:start position:0%
all about cost and access and he said
 
02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
this may improve access but it's going
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
to accelerate cost and that's going to
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
be a problem for private practices it's
 
02:09:07.709 --> 02:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
going to be a problem for patients and
 
02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth so inspired by that I
 
02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
actually read the entire thing a couple
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
months later I happen to talk to the um
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
head of CMS for the Northeast region and
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
I asked asked him I said after reading
 
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
this I have some serious concerns about
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act in terms about
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
patient access especially for complex
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
patients and miscellaneous other people
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
and his response to me was that the
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
trains left the station you're either on
 
02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
it or you're not and my response to him
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
was my concern is your re rear wheels
 
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
off the track and I'll be more than
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
happy to catch up and when the train
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
falls off the tracks totally I'll try to
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
help you get back on there were two
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
issues that were important in that disc
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
discussion one was prior authorization
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
and the other one was the electronic
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
medical record I provided a quote for
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
you with the original testimony about my
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about how people that are in it
 
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
feel about the disaster that the
 
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
electronic record has been and how it's
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
harmed uh communication between doctors
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
and patients cost of Private Practice
 
02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
which I think should be the Bedrock of
 
02:10:12.669 --> 02:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
Health Care um and so I won't go into
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
that any further but my attempt here is
 
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
to try to put the the train back on the
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
tracks in a direction I think we don't
 
02:10:21.549 --> 02:10:21.559 align:start position:0%
really want it to go um the other thing
 
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
that inspired me in doing this is I
 
02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
believe in whole person integrated care
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
and right now we have a whole bunch of
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
providers that are excluded from that
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
model such as chiropractors
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist massage therapists and
 
02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
other people have a lot to contribute
 
02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
who are not being included now and it's
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
my sincere hope that they will be in the
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
near future um this bill would allow
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
them to do what they're doing without
 
02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
being forced to use an electronic record
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
to submit their bills and things like
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
that because to be hon honest that would
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
threaten their financial existence and I
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that's good for patients or
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
providers and I think on that note I'll
 
02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
end representative
 
02:11:00.669 --> 02:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and first of
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
all I'm incredibly sympathetic to the
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
points that you're making um
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
because I think they're right okay so
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's item number one item number two
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
is I have a concern with paragraph two
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh because I talked to a colleague on um
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce and their concern that it is um
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
inir conflict with federal law and I
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about this area to be
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
able to deal with whether that's okay or
 
02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's not okay and I was
 
02:11:45.669 --> 02:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
wondering if it would be possible for us
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
to put this off and have our researcher
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
do a little more research on that issue
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh because on the one hand uh I would I
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
would like to do anything in my power to
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
make this particular situation better
 
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't think getting us into a
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
conflict of laws state if that's what's
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to happen would actually get us
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
farther forward and we may be removing
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
one more wheel from the track which I
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
would rather not
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
do representative Nagel with do you have
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
a response sure um so one of the points
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
that I made when I presented this bill
 
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
originally was that
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
um I had a very I'm I'm sorry this is a
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
little bit circular but um I work with
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
University of Rochester school of
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
healthc care policy economics and they
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
voiced a concern that it's not that that
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
is happening it's really happening is
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
that we're witnessing healthc care being
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
taken over by increasing and increasing
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
size of entities that they use the
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
electronic record for data collection
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
and for um billing purposes to the EXP
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh to the um harm of patients
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
basically I mean we we've lost our focus
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing this is true at the
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
federal and state levels my original
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
reason to bring this bill actually
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
forward was to make a very very very
 
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
public statement that we got to stop
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
this and it and it's not just a local
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
level it's a federal level and it what's
 
02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
f to me was the prior authorization bill
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
that I initially brought was brought for
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
the same reason in the process of us
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
doing that we put a lot of pressure on
 
02:13:29.229 --> 02:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government to realize what
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing wrong is wrong with that
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
as well and in the end they ended up
 
02:13:35.950 --> 02:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
passing legislation or recently CMS just
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
passed a total change in the way they're
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
doing prior authorization that totally
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
mirrored the bill that we created and so
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
now we have two parallel bills that both
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
will solve a problem and it's my intent
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
that this is a very public statement
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
that what you're doing is wrong that you
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
can't require people to be your data
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
collectors and you're billing people
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
that you you can't ruin people's
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
practices and that you need to stop
 
02:14:03.629 --> 02:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
doing this and that I think that my hope
 
02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
is that what we're doing here will not
 
02:14:07.629 --> 02:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
conflict but align with what should
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
become federal
 
02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
policy what about the suggestion now you
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
made the motion to um about to pass is
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
amended representative Weber has
 
02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
suggested further
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
research uh that was my specific uh
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
question I mean my gut sense is I really
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
want to go ahead um I and this is going
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
to be really rude and and um lady gadiva
 
02:14:35.709 --> 02:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
is of me but um I think that making this
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
statement's incredibly important and I I
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
would I understand your point because
 
02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
it's been raised twice to Me Now by two
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
different insurers who both agreed that
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is a good idea but both said
 
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
what you said representative Shapiro and
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant yes I'm I know there was
 
02:14:57.149 --> 02:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
some questioning of whether this should
 
02:14:59.149 --> 02:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
have gone to our committee to Commerce
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the first place and I'm so I'm
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if we pass this bill and can
 
02:15:06.549 --> 02:15:06.559 align:start position:0%
we make a recommendation that it go to
 
02:15:09.109 --> 02:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
Commerce or is that it's I would make
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be too late for an early
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill at that
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
point the clerk the clerk's standing
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
there and shaking his
 
02:15:20.189 --> 02:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
head there's your answer but I would
 
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
love it representative
 
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman um I do
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the federal Rissa
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
the Employee Retirement insurance safety
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
act which was passed in
 
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
1974 and that will take precedent over
 
02:15:43.629 --> 02:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
any state law so what I'm not sure about
 
02:15:47.229 --> 02:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
back to represent Weber are we running
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
into a a situation where the federal law
 
02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
trumps the state law in this Arena and I
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
really don't know I think we need to
 
02:15:57.149 --> 02:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
find out I also would say if you wanted
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
to change it represent Nel let put down
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
that any public health carrier governed
 
02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
by State law versus Federal law maybe at
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
least a way to avoid the conflict
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
between the federal and the state I I'm
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
really sorry that was a great point and
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you and I have
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
learned in our six years together on all
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
the stuff we've done is that we do here
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
has a very small effect on the Health
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
Care system as a whole what I write here
 
02:16:27.310 --> 02:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
can only affect State not federal
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
insurers so what we would write here
 
02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
would have no effect on Medicare
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid whatever um so I I think that's
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
a wonderful idea so would you be open to
 
02:16:37.709 --> 02:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
amending the amendment to be sure we're
 
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
only talking about state law and not run
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
a foul of federal law that's fair I'm
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
fine with that so are you then saying
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
motion

02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
we quickly go up to uh the fourth floor
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
with the draft and uh get it to us to
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
get it to the fourth floor fourth floor
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
to pass out to our colleagues to review
 
02:16:57.399 --> 02:16:58.509 align:start position:0%
to pass out to our colleagues to review
the

02:16:58.509 --> 02:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
amendment all right so you had you had
 
02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
second I'll withdraw my second and um
 
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
just as a little bit more of that
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
procedural we um have hearings in the
 
02:17:08.349 --> 02:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon and we actually have noticed
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
to continue our executive sessions
 
02:17:13.950 --> 02:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um at 10:40 after two hearings
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
and I know um OS is pretty stressed so
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
if I think we'll be able to have it in
 
02:17:19.389 --> 02:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
time for that they have quite a few
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
amendments given the deadline so I think
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
if we aim to try and have that for
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when we restart executive
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
sessions at 1040 I think that'll be a
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
great way to get this done and I would
 
02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
just representative Weber I I would just
 
02:17:36.429 --> 02:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
add that I I very much appreciate that
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
um Amendment and that would make me much
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
happier it's probably true anyway but I
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
would be much happier in in voting for
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay so um and I know there's some
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
scheduling issues
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
um some individual scheduling issues
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
from what I understand U and we've
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
already noticed that tomorrow we will
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
continue executive session we actually
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
may be able to see what happens after
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
our hearings today I don't know if
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with anybody being
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to attend that noticed executive
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
session at 10:40 which is uh well ahead
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
of the caucuses and
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
session Mr chairman representative
 
02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
Merchant it's more of a
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
timeline can we exact on something
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and still get a community
 
02:18:26.429 --> 02:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
report in time to get it into the
 
02:18:28.669 --> 02:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
calendar we've done all the early ones
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
we've done all the early ones yes this
 
02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
but this is a fiscal note would it have
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
an early one it's not early yeah all
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note bills are not necessarily
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
early okay thank you the two early bills
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
that we had to get done we did get done
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
and I should have mentioned this at the
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
beginning uh there was a little
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
confusion about HB 1585 that has been
 
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
continued to March 6
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
there had been previously um announced
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
that it would be we would we would
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
continue to March 6 and then we
 
02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
mistakenly had noticed it for today so
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think there's
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
some some question here about timing and
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'd love to hear about it but uh we do
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
have a session noticed tomorrow and I
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
think we have what three bills left is
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
that correct well if we put the 1604 off
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
we'll have four tomorrow um oh okay well
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
in any case we
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
but all of the bills that we have left
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
to take up are are are not on deadline
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
so none of them are on deadline so they
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to be finished and if I could
 
02:19:31.150 --> 02:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
then um if not on a deadline could we do
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
hold off until next week when we exec on
 
02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:34.110 align:start position:0%
hold off until next week when we exec on
those

02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
bills it's it's up to the chair and to
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
is there is there a specific reason you
 
02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
want to put that off or to take off some
 
02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
of the pressure on OS and the people
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
upstairs in it's only a couple of words
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
for this one so I think tomorrow is okay
 
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
rather than next week it's always good
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
to move it along as quickly as we can
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
getting them off our plate is a really
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
good thing if we can get it done if they
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
can't get it done then they can't get it
 
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
done and we can't vote on it
 
02:20:04.349 --> 02:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
so so B based on this conversation we
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
would be continuing hb1 1683 FN hb1 1660
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
FN HB 1568 FN and
 
02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:16.349 align:start position:0%
FN HB 1568 FN and
hb04

02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
hb04
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
FN any
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
questions okay and uh again we have
 
02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
hearings this
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh and we will recess until
 
02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:30.870 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh and we will recess until
then

02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
works then that gives us 11 more minutes
 
02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
to have lunchtime before hearings so
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're Mr chairman so we're putting off
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
these other bills as
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
well okay
okay

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
feel that feel okay you to with that I
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
be honest I mean I knew it was a problem
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
befor and my intent was never to
 
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:21.349 align:start position:0%
befor and my intent was never to
infect

02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.790 --> 02:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean no that was a
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
brilliant I mean I think in the reality
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
is just wouldn't I I think I think that
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's right if it
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
pass the effect but I think it's much
 
02:21:38.910 --> 02:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
better to make it very specific that we
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
understand what we're doing as opposed
 
02:21:43.469 --> 02:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
to oh we didn't know what we were do we
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
we should I mean I should have been more
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
proactive about that but you know that
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
said I mean it's kind of inspired me to
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
have meetings with
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
andever um you know
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
about you know this issue because it's
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know I was shocked that CMS
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
literally passed that statement two days
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
before our hearing on the other and that
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
dramatic prior authorization bill and I
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
was like all right fine you guys are
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this stuff this is great so
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
you know I think we can pair our efforts
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
betterly it gives me a reason to meet
 
02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:19.110 align:start position:0%
betterly it gives me a reason to meet
with

02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know I know from being a
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
small provider that this affects a lot
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
of people oh my
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
God in the last 10 years I was in
 
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
Project practice and I couldn't afford a
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
medical not only couldn't I afford
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
it it would have well if you're to be
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
honest it's doing that to a lot of
 
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
people now and it's the reason why you
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
know they look record as the leading
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
cuse of
 
02:22:50.349 --> 02:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
Bur that's I mean we're talking like 60
 
02:22:52.349 --> 02:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
60% of the
 
02:22:55.070 --> 02:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
VAR my thought is here it says
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
no Private health
 
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
care so on line
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
eight all we're doing is saying no
 
02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
public or private healthare carrier
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%

1028 and I recognize the prime sponsor
 
03:36:44.429 --> 03:36:44.439 align:start position:0%

03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
1028 a bill relative to the definition
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
of mental illness for the purposes of
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Mental Health Services
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
system uh I provided a copy of EV of the
 
03:37:17.309 --> 03:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
bill in larger print for everyone
 
03:37:20.349 --> 03:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's on in front of you and I
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
invite you to look at the definition uh
 
03:37:25.870 --> 03:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 135
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
SE uh to Roman X or 10 um and the the
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
interesting thing there is focus on the
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
last sentence and I think you can
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
understand that treatment of
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
impairment for emotional
 
03:37:47.389 --> 03:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
processes can be and should be different
 
03:37:51.550 --> 03:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
if the issue is epilepsy drug addiction
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
or alcohol addiction or other uh
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
intoxication yet intellectual disability
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
has been lumped in with that category
 
03:38:03.710 --> 03:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's an inappropriate
 
03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
segregation um and as noted in the in uh
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
C colon 3
 
03:38:14.429 --> 03:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
um it is also there's segregation there
 
03:38:18.429 --> 03:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
for co- concurrence with development uh
 
03:38:21.389 --> 03:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
disability so I I know you received
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
comments from the New Hampshire
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
Community Behavioral Health Association
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
that said services are available to
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
these folks services are provided for
 
03:38:32.229 --> 03:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
these folks nothing uh prohibits their
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
treatment but I filed this bill on on
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
the behalf of folks who are not being
 
03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
adequately treated and and that that's
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
what needs to be addressed um I'm not
 
03:38:45.630 --> 03:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
going to go into a big discussion of
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
those those issues that you have several
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
pink cards of people who want to talk
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
about the exact rationale uh for that
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
and among them is an Sanic who was the
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
driver of of this uh Bill's uh
 
03:39:03.070 --> 03:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
presentation so uh I'd be happy to
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but I would really
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
like you to hear their
 
03:39:10.990 --> 03:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
stories okay any questions for
 
03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:12.990 align:start position:0%
stories okay any questions for
representative

03:39:12.990 --> 03:39:13.000 align:start position:0%

University as representative Bernardi uh
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out to you uh really what we're
 
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
targeting here are the definition
 
03:40:32.910 --> 03:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
sections under the mental health statute
 
03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
of 135 C colon 2 it defines mental
 
03:40:40.189 --> 03:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
illness and there's a clause in there
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
shockingly includes a clause which
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
excludes those with development
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities from Mental
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
Health Services it says it does not
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
include P impairment primarily caused by
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
epilepsy intellectual
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
disability uh you know related drug or
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh problems so really what we're
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
looking for is to remove that Clause
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
statute really we're trying to end
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination against persons with
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities and improve
 
03:41:14.309 --> 03:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
the mental health services in in New
 
03:41:16.750 --> 03:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it's been an evolution
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
obviously mental health has changed
 
03:41:20.349 --> 03:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the past decades
 
03:41:22.110 --> 03:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
indeed centuries there's always new
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
insights into mental illness
 
03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
advancements in Science Education
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
medicine and law uh it's certainly a
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
process of trial and error and one of
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
the main errors that Still Remains a
 
03:41:35.429 --> 03:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
huge problem it's been a detriment and
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
Major Impact on individuals indiv uh
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
their families and certainly the pockets
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayer is that persons with
 
03:41:47.710 --> 03:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability are often the
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
ones stuck in ER for weeks months at a
 
03:41:53.110 --> 03:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
time we all you've all heard about the
 
03:41:55.630 --> 03:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
problem with ER boarding going on in the
 
03:41:58.349 --> 03:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire uh I can
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
attest to that uh having my son having
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
been uh in there uh for 28 days in
 
03:42:08.349 --> 03:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
exiter at one time uh the ER is not
 
03:42:10.590 --> 03:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
equipped as you've heard probably in
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
different uh meetings to deal with
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
problems of psychiatric boarding uh a
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
state hospital the state hospitals refus
 
03:42:21.630 --> 03:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
to admit them uh often not always uh
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
despite having all the resources to
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
handle uh and treat a said persons with
 
03:42:29.229 --> 03:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities and so they're
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
they they sit in there and their
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
warehouse there often for my son was for
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
20 28 days uh while he was there not one
 
03:42:39.269 --> 03:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
doctor not one social work from the
 
03:42:41.229 --> 03:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
community health Center or state
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
employee really had a solution he was
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
clearly in the throws of a psychotic
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
break and that's why we brought him
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
there that's why these parents bring
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
them there they're not like hey let's go
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the emergency room today um uh there
 
03:42:56.910 --> 03:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's a major problem going on and
 
03:42:59.149 --> 03:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's very different often than what has
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
been going on at home um uh with the
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
person uh that's why every in person
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
with intellectual disability ends up in
 
03:43:10.189 --> 03:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
the ER they're told to go there by by
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers and
 
03:43:15.070 --> 03:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
by the area agencies by their social
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
workers by the doctors everyone goes go
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
to the and then they find that nothing
 
03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
really happens um New Hampshire State
 
03:43:27.070 --> 03:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
Hospital refused to admit my son at that
 
03:43:29.950 --> 03:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
time on grounds he was autistic and that
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
his symptoms and behaviors were only
 
03:43:35.070 --> 03:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
related to that or primarily related to
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
that and that brings me back to that
 
03:43:40.269 --> 03:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
clause in the statute which says
 
03:43:43.590 --> 03:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
primarily impaired due to they latch on
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
to that becomes the pass uh free pass uh
 
03:43:48.550 --> 03:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to address it yeah
 
03:43:50.349 --> 03:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
if you could startop please wrapping up
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay um basically uh this can't be
 
03:43:57.149 --> 03:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
resolved by it's the it's not my
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
department Mantra and that's what that
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute does everyone
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
cannot stay in their own lane on this
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
issue uh and with the language that's in
 
03:44:06.990 --> 03:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
there there needs to be a conduit
 
03:44:09.630 --> 03:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
between the state agencies and removal
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
of this phrase which expressly excludes
 
03:44:13.710 --> 03:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
individuals with disability mental
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
disabil intellectual disabilities from
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
our mental health care and this would be
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
a step in the right direction the
 
03:44:22.990 --> 03:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
subject Clause only exacerbates the
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
problem removing it will motivate the
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
mental health system in this state as
 
03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
well as the other ancillary
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
organizations to work together to
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
address this Gap in the system and end
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
the discriminatory allocation of mental
 
03:44:38.110 --> 03:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
health services so I urge you to support
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
this bill on behalf of of people with um
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities who really
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
been shut out of really important care
 
03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
and treatment thank you thank you you
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
taking questions or oh uh representative
 
03:44:53.469 --> 03:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:44:55.630 --> 03:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you understand
 
03:44:58.349 --> 03:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
the history of why this incl this
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
exclusion is there in the first place I
 
03:45:02.030 --> 03:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think I do I think it's sort of
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
twofold one is to make sure that people
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
with intellectual disabilities don't get
 
03:45:09.790 --> 03:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
mislabeled as mentally ill uh but I I
 
03:45:13.710 --> 03:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
think the other primary uh uh reason is
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
is really it's not my department um that
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
there's a really sort of um you know
 
03:45:22.110 --> 03:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're intellectually disabled
 
03:45:24.189 --> 03:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
these people are mentally ill you know
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
these people are this and it's not that
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
clear there should be there's not that
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
defined distinction in reality and to
 
03:45:34.830 --> 03:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
exclude them it it it it does have
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
doctors a lot of doctors and
 
03:45:38.590 --> 03:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists are not really familiar
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
with people with intellectual
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities with down syndromes with
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
autism they don't get it that's not what
 
03:45:45.870 --> 03:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
they do just like the heart surgeon
 
03:45:48.590 --> 03:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't know about um you know setting a
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
bone and uh it becomes an because
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
there's that presumption it's like a
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
legal presumption that's been put in an
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
unjustified legal presumption has been
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
put in the statute that's a trigger and
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
a signal to uh these pych units and
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals to go oh no we don't have to
 
03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
do that because it's primarily caused by
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
your autism or your Down syndrome your
 
03:46:12.030 --> 03:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
behavior whatever you're doing uh if
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
you're aggressive if you're uh you know
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
having Illusions and um and and and
 
03:46:20.070 --> 03:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's wrong it doesn't work I think it
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
might have been well intended for sure
 
03:46:24.510 --> 03:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh but it's become that that's the
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
reason why people are sitting in the
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms and then ultimately I
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
would tie it to the fact that many of
 
03:46:30.990 --> 03:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
these people with intellectual
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities after they've been in the
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
emergency room no place to go in New
 
03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know where they're sent
 
03:46:40.030 --> 03:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
Texas uh Massachusetts um uh uh
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania you know we're we're
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
spending up to a half a million dollars
 
03:46:45.790 --> 03:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes on these people if you just
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
took the time to stabilize them you
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
might have avoided that major life event
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
and crisis follow up so just a quick
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
followup then on that in the case of
 
03:46:59.309 --> 03:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
your son who was kept at the ER for 28
 
03:47:01.830 --> 03:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
days what was the ultimate resolution
 
03:47:04.590 --> 03:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
there he never got admitted to um they
 
03:47:06.030 --> 03:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
were trying to get him to New Hampshire
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
hospital they actually took him up in an
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh well he was there like a
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
week took him up he was in there less
 
03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
than 10 minutes he didn't get off the
 
03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
stretcher they sent him back and just
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
phoned and said not not taking him he's
 
03:47:22.990 --> 03:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
autistic so he stayed in the emergency
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
room again 28 days um and then finally
 
03:47:29.229 --> 03:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
um the Bureau of Developmental Services
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
after you know scrambling around found a
 
03:47:33.389 --> 03:47:33.399 align:start position:0%
placement in Massachusetts the judge
 
03:47:35.550 --> 03:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
renberg Center and he was taken down
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
there by ambulance uh and he was you
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
know he was really stable able you know
 
03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
within a a week of being there um he
 
03:47:44.349 --> 03:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
ended up staying there for a longer
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
period but um yeah I mean it we need to
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
deal with the stuff in the house and we
 
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to we need more Cooks in the
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
kitchen on this not less and these these
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
people need to work and it's not going
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
to disrupt the system by taking out a
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
phrase uh it's going to force the
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
parties to talk together new policies
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
new Arrangements new conversations um
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
instead of going not my department next
 
03:48:11.710 --> 03:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
window uh questions representative uh
 
03:48:13.950 --> 03:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
Nagel and then representative Merchant
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
03:48:17.469 --> 03:48:17.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question first of all I would
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
like to thank you and the sponsor for
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill in this is very
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
important to me personally um and I
 
03:48:25.469 --> 03:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that you did it and I
 
03:48:27.189 --> 03:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
think it's simultaneously sad that you
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
did it comorbidities are really common
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
and we really can't differentiate what I
 
03:48:34.830 --> 03:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
what I I what I'm wondering about is
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
number one how pervasive do you think
 
03:48:40.269 --> 03:48:40.279 align:start position:0%
this problem actually is and is it
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
is there any relation to severity and
 
03:48:43.950 --> 03:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
the only reason I asked that question is
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
I have an autistic son um he's quote
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
high functioning whatever that means
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
we've never had troubles with the mental
 
03:48:54.269 --> 03:48:54.279 align:start position:0%
health system and I I'm just curious if
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
if this issue is as pervasive as you're
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
saying and it's pervasive for a small
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
population uh and if they go to the
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
emergency I would say it's extremely
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
pervasive so yeah it's not going to
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
impact a huge amount of people but I
 
03:49:10.269 --> 03:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
can't even tell you that H that we go
 
03:49:12.189 --> 03:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
through when you're in that situation
 
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire's under a court order
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
by The District Court uh to n boarding
 
03:49:19.469 --> 03:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
in 2025 actually it's supposed to be
 
03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
2024 but I guess there's an extension
 
03:49:23.710 --> 03:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
till next
 
03:49:26.510 --> 03:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
year are these are these folks factored
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
into that equation is the mental health
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
going oh yeah okay we've got we're going
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
to board more people now in our own
 
03:49:34.750 --> 03:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
psych units take them out of the ER but
 
03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
not you and not you and not you so
 
03:49:39.870 --> 03:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
what's the hospital going to do um you
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
know I I mean they PE the mental health
 
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
system needs to take some ownership of
 
03:49:46.870 --> 03:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
this it has to be a shared uh allocation
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
of resources and shared delivery of of
 
03:49:53.790 --> 03:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
services and um it it is pervasive for
 
03:49:55.389 --> 03:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
the folks who do have intellectual
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
disability and do go to the ER um and
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're not being taken
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
occasionally they are occasionally they
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
are and sometimes they do receive
 
03:50:07.389 --> 03:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
services at the community health centers
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
but not always my son is denied services
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
at Northern Community Human Services up
 
03:50:16.830 --> 03:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the conquer Conway area because he
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
can't participate in talk therapy he
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
does need Med he needs half these people
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
if not more are on antis psychotic drugs
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
and depr anti-depressants they're taking
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
the same medication that that normal
 
03:50:31.710 --> 03:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
mental ailed people are are taking or
 
03:50:33.469 --> 03:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
you know there people among us are on
 
03:50:34.990 --> 03:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
that you know you function live your
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
life um they won't see him because he
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
can't participate in talk therapy well
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
now they have to go find some contractor
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
doctor tell a uh you know which works
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
fine for him but again another example
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
of well we don't do it that way well
 
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
well you need to accommodate this
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
particular population and do it
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
differently that's the point
 
03:50:56.349 --> 03:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
03:50:56.359 --> 03:50:58.309 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
representative

03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:00.670 --> 03:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairperson thank you for taking my
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
question I concur this is a very
 
03:51:07.590 --> 03:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
important issue that we need to solve
 
03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
and do it correctly
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
and terminology is so important both in
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
statute as well as rules I'm looking
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
over you brought the issue of autism and
 
03:51:20.429 --> 03:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
based upon what I've been able to find
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
on Google Dr Google Mr
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
Google autism is not considered a mental
 
03:51:29.349 --> 03:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
illness or intellectual disability it
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
does cause issues with learning per se
 
03:51:36.030 --> 03:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not listed as a quote mental
 
03:51:37.870 --> 03:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
health issue so I want to be sure that
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
we don't somehow EX exclude what I think
 
03:51:41.950 --> 03:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get to is children with
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
autism that need to be taken care of
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
because if we don't use the right words
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
we may inadvertently have AED conse
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
autism isn't in there I mean it's a good
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
point mean know it's it's a question of
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
semantics a lot of times typically
 
03:51:55.630 --> 03:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
though I would say uh the UN you know
 
03:51:56.910 --> 03:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
they use the word intellectual
 
03:51:59.309 --> 03:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
disability because you you can be on the
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum and not have an
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability so technically
 
03:52:05.550 --> 03:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
under this framing of the language you
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be excluded but believe me if
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
that word autism
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
slips out of your mouth and they call up
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Hospital they're
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
going to hang their hat on that because
 
03:52:16.590 --> 03:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
it's equated with intellectual
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities and many people with um
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
most people uh when you're when you're
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
associated with an area agency they're
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
the ones who deliver services to those
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
with a developmental disability the
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
people often that they take who are
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
Autistic or down syndrome they do have
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
an intellectual disability it's just you
 
03:52:36.830 --> 03:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
different words are often
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeable but not always
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for that and I do
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
concur I think a lot of times words are
 
03:52:47.309 --> 03:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
semantics but they're important
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
semantics and I just want to be sure
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
that whatever we're writing in the bill
 
03:52:53.189 --> 03:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
that we get the right words that we need
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
to take care of the issue we're trying
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
to solve well I think if you take out
 
03:52:59.149 --> 03:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
the word intellectual disability they
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be saying I'm denying you
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
because of autism they do do say that
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
but really what they're they're meaning
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
is we see you as in then that person may
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
be intellectually disabled often they
 
03:53:10.590 --> 03:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
are call my son autistic but he's
 
03:53:12.189 --> 03:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
definitely intellectually disabled
 
03:53:14.670 --> 03:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of syllables so it's just
 
03:53:16.389 --> 03:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
easier to say they're autistic people
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
kind of get that if you I say he's
 
03:53:20.590 --> 03:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
severely autistic that's even a better
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
description but I think if you remove
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
the phrase intellectual disability
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
there'd be no basis to carp lanch deny
 
03:53:29.309 --> 03:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
somebody certainly doctors can make
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
assessments and in their own
 
03:53:33.550 --> 03:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
professional judgment evaluate but you
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
can't do it over the phone and you can't
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
do it in a 10-minute thing you need to
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
talk to the parents you need to talk to
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
the school you need to talk to the
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
primary you need to look at the medical
 
03:53:43.950 --> 03:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
records that's not happening and that's
 
03:53:46.349 --> 03:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
proper standard of care they just go on
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
the word autism or intellectual
 
03:53:51.910 --> 03:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
disability case closed representative
 
03:53:55.750 --> 03:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
Kofa thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
for taking this question I I hear your
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
frustration with
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
um receiving or not receiving U mental
 
03:54:09.429 --> 03:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
health um
 
03:54:11.189 --> 03:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
Services whether it's New Hampshire
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
hospital or services in the emergency
 
03:54:16.590 --> 03:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
room or just outpatient services from a
 
03:54:19.750 --> 03:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center I I hear
 
03:54:21.790 --> 03:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
your frustration and I understand it and
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
I think that there's our mental health
 
03:54:27.790 --> 03:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is really lacking in this
 
03:54:29.950 --> 03:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
state for people with developmental
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities and for people without
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities so I
 
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
understand completely why you would want
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
to put in
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
um in the second part of this bill an
 
03:54:44.149 --> 03:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
individual shall not be determined
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
ineligible for services under this
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
chapter based on a co-occurrence of
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
mental illness I that makes total sense
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
to me I'm less clear why you're
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
interested in making the other change
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
which crosses
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
out um parenthesis B intellectual
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
disability because just like you said in
 
03:55:07.229 --> 03:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
the beginning you don't want people to
 
03:55:10.030 --> 03:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
be assumed it says
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
it does not include impairment primarily
 
03:55:16.870 --> 03:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
caus caused by these conditions so like
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
you said in the beginning you don't want
 
03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
the assumption that someone is mentally
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
ill if they're not mentally ill but
 
03:55:25.389 --> 03:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
they're developmentally disabled or they
 
03:55:28.389 --> 03:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
have epilepsy or so it's a little bit
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
less clear to me why I'm not sure if
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
you're the one asking for the change but
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit less clear to me why
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
you want that change uh because I think
 
03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's a it's a say um first
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
of all I don't think that group needs to
 
03:55:43.469 --> 03:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
be in there number one why are they in
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
there uh why is in yes it's really um
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're removing that and then you're re
 
03:55:52.149 --> 03:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
reiterating the reminder that
 
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
co-occurring can occur basically uh that
 
03:55:57.309 --> 03:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
phrase intellectual disability just
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken out of the bucket
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a trigger and it's a signal
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
to mental health professionals that oh
 
03:56:04.830 --> 03:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't um they're they're not going
 
03:56:07.550 --> 03:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to see what's happening um
 
03:56:10.229 --> 03:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
and it allows them to kind of gravitate
 
03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
towards that as the causation rather
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
than sort of keeping an open mind and
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
really examining everything
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that does that answer your
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
question say it again I hear it no I
 
03:56:26.349 --> 03:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
think that I I think that does answer
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
the question I'm not it's not it doesn't
 
03:56:33.750 --> 03:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
respond to the logic but it responds to
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
the the message you want to give to
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
people they shouldn't exclude these
 
03:56:39.149 --> 03:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
people because they have somebody from
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Center will
 
03:56:42.309 --> 03:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
tell you oh we treat people with
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
co-occurring let's and they do have
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disabilities go
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
in there uh not always sometimes they
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
will say not uh but you know really my f
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
main focus is is sort of the ER boarding
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the lack of short-term or long-term
 
03:57:01.870 --> 03:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
um psych uh impatient care but I think
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
removing intellectual disability just
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
changes the conversation like you have
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with this this is a co-occurring
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to start there we're not
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to go oh is the prime what is
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
primary impairment is it 90% is it 60%
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
is it 40% are we going to get into that
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's impossible in many instances
 
03:57:23.590 --> 03:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
to parse that out um doctors you know
 
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly still have that discretion in
 
03:57:27.550 --> 03:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
their professional judgment to make an
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
analysis and an evaluation of the person
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
but basically my point is that phrase is
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
really shutting the door in many
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
instances where many instances I've
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
talked to many parents really over the
 
03:57:41.149 --> 03:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
last six years I get five or six calls
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
every year from a parent I heard you
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
went through this what do I do I'm I'm
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
in Elliott my son's been in there 14
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
days blah blah blah um and they're they
 
03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
just called and said uh autism that they
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
got a phone call from the state hospital
 
03:57:56.950 --> 03:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
or from the a psych unit that they
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
didn't even see the person they just
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
have the ER report and they call and say
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
oh no no we're not taking them so that's
 
03:58:06.429 --> 03:58:06.439 align:start position:0%
why I want that out follow up follow up
 
03:58:08.670 --> 03:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
so it's your experience or experience
 
03:58:10.630 --> 03:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
you've heard about that specifically New
 
03:58:13.990 --> 03:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital excludes people even
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
if they have a co-occurring disorder
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do and sometimes they
 
03:58:19.590 --> 03:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't but they have because they have
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
the yeah I mean I realize there's a bed
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
issue too and and that that could be a
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
justifiable but I do think there's
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
cherry-picking going on and I think that
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
phrase helps it's just discriminatory to
 
03:58:34.510 --> 03:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
me on its face thank you representative
 
03:58:35.389 --> 03:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and then
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative McKay thank you Mr
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
question so uh following up on
 
03:58:46.149 --> 03:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's question um if
 
03:58:48.429 --> 03:58:48.439 align:start position:0%
we were not to remove anything but to
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
just add something like comma including
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
autism uh or in would or or if we were
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
to specifically include autism would
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
that be would would you have any reason
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
to object to that yes I would I think
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
that would complicate it not simplify it
 
03:59:06.790 --> 03:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
I think if we remove it out the convers
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the doctors you know you're just
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to deal with the person based on
 
03:59:13.309 --> 03:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
the the symptomology that's being
 
03:59:16.030 --> 03:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
presented in the entire medical history
 
03:59:18.910 --> 03:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
you're not why is that in there it's an
 
03:59:22.590 --> 03:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
unjust presumption of ineligibility and
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
it should not be a legal presumption um
 
03:59:29.149 --> 03:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
I think taking that out every you know
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
the like I said doctors still have
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
discretion uh you know who's doing the
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
admissions and whatnot to evaluate the
 
03:59:37.950 --> 03:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of that admission but to
 
03:59:39.070 --> 03:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
just go over over the phone they're
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
autistic we're not taking them or I
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand this and believe me
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
they do not understand it there's a
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
diagnostic manual that many people even
 
03:59:49.550 --> 03:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
at the community health centers are
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
unaware of you've heard the diagnostic
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
manual for you know psychiatric symptoms
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
and um this one is dm2 ID I have a a a
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
friend who is a therapist at seos mental
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
health she said never heard of it we
 
04:00:07.710 --> 04:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have it there wasn't trained in
 
04:00:10.269 --> 04:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
it social work school never had a
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
training here I you know if anything by
 
04:00:14.910 --> 04:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
doing this you're going to make the
 
04:00:17.550 --> 04:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Community more educated
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
and aware of Developmental Disabilities
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they can use that expertise to work
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the Bureau of Developmental
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
services with the area of agencies say
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
let hey let's come together and and and
 
04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
come up a solution maybe they can have
 
04:00:31.870 --> 04:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
some dedicated beds or people trained in
 
04:00:34.349 --> 04:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities they can go
 
04:00:36.510 --> 04:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
there instead of being boarded at the uh
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
ER they're going to have to go there in
 
04:00:41.309 --> 04:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
a year and they can't deny them and if
 
04:00:42.750 --> 04:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
they do deny them there's going to be a
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit they need to be trained on this
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
and educated like I said mental health
 
04:00:49.950 --> 04:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
is an evolving process there's all new
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
information Discovery we want like I
 
04:00:54.429 --> 04:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
said we want more people on this not
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
less and that's why I think that phrase
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be removed followup
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt um yeah so I want
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
to clarify my question I'm I'm
 
04:01:06.149 --> 04:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
suggesting that in the language that is
 
04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
added that said an individual shall not
 
04:01:09.199 --> 04:01:10.110 align:start position:0%
added that said an individual shall not
be

04:01:10.110 --> 04:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
denied that we would specifically add
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
autism to that so that it is very very
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
clear that intellectual or developmental
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
disability shall include autism you're
 
04:01:22.590 --> 04:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
saying you would object to that oh no no
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you can you know just more
 
04:01:25.950 --> 04:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
more people might want to add other
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
definitions but um yeah that that would
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
be fine I would have I don't think
 
04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
anyone representative McKay and then
 
04:01:31.720 --> 04:01:34.550 align:start position:0%
anyone representative McKay and then
representative

04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
chairman u i probably should ask should
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
have asked the uh sponsor of this bill
 
04:01:43.800 --> 04:01:45.710 align:start position:0%
have asked the uh sponsor of this bill
um

04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
feel that these statements do not
 
04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
reflect the system that's in that's in
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
effect in New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
has a very
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensive program uh in mental
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
health and Community Mental Health
 
04:02:13.149 --> 04:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
Services the DD population is totally
 
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
separate from that it's not separate sir
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's not separate they're they're
 
04:02:20.429 --> 04:02:20.439 align:start position:0%
connected many many times most people
 
04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
who many people with intellectual
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
disability a autism and down syndrome
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
are on uh anti-depressants anxiety
 
04:02:31.990 --> 04:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
medications uh they're on uh anticho
 
04:02:34.830 --> 04:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
they're on mood disorder drugs it's not
 
04:02:37.229 --> 04:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
separate it's no different than any of
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
the regular popul population the
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
currence of mental illness in people
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
with intellectual disabilities and your
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
regular population it's it's the same
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
percentage so it's not separate and um
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
they need to be joined together and
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
there needs to be communication but I'm
 
04:02:54.750 --> 04:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I interrupted
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
you yes you did uh the uh my my
 
04:03:03.189 --> 04:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
background is mental health I used to be
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
in charge of Community Mental Health
 
04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
Services I was in private practice this
 
04:03:14.189 --> 04:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
as a psychotherapist for 35 years I have
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
five college
 
04:03:18.750 --> 04:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
degrees uh so that some of the things
 
04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying are based on the pain that
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
you have experienced dealing with the
 
04:03:28.429 --> 04:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
system uh because they're not accurate
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
of what you're saying and I can see
 
04:03:34.269 --> 04:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
people sitting in the audience who are
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
agreeing with you I hope there's
 
04:03:41.229 --> 04:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department uh for for
 
04:03:44.189 --> 04:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
example the department produces every 10
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
years State Mental Health Plan I don't
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
know if you're familiar with that I
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
wrote the one before this and not one
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
part of that was ever implemented
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
because we hit the
 
04:04:02.550 --> 04:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
recession uh the cost of Metal Health
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
Services is
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
extensive uh and but
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
the what what this does the is
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
not uh describing the mental health
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
system that's in effect in New Hampshire
 
04:04:25.389 --> 04:04:25.399 align:start position:0%
well what it does show is some of the
 
04:04:28.389 --> 04:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
complaints that people have had and I
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
have been very strong about what we call
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
the borders the number of people who are
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
like today if you go up to conget
 
04:04:37.279 --> 04:04:38.469 align:start position:0%
like today if you go up to conget
hospital

04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:04:41.309 --> 04:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
you go down a certain Ward there are
 
04:04:43.630 --> 04:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
people in there that New Hampshire
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
hospital is not ready yet they don't
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
have the vacancy to have those people in
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
there the legislature has passed new
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
legislation they're building new
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
facilities and I could hope that the
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
families of those with mental illness
 
04:05:05.309 --> 04:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
would would be the
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
supporters of developing a more
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive system rather
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
than than attacking them uh it's a
 
04:05:21.149 --> 04:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
extremely complex issue uh but that I
 
04:05:24.510 --> 04:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire over the last 20
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
years has done a remarkable job of
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
providing care to the most severely
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
mentally ill I I I agree with you in a
 
04:05:39.070 --> 04:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
lot of respects but there's a gap and
 
04:05:41.630 --> 04:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
they haven't been um providing
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
significant care to this population and
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
um we do by passing this bill I feel
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
like we're contributing in a positive
 
04:05:53.550 --> 04:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
way to improving a comprehensive um
 
04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
mental health system I mean certainly
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
anyone in the leadership position and
 
04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
who's been involved in mental health for
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
a long time you know you see the great
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
work that you've done and you want to
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
tout that but you're hearing from people
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the trenches from the people who were
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
there dayt day and you're like you know
 
04:06:15.790 --> 04:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
what this isn't working for for this
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
group and we've been saying that for a
 
04:06:21.389 --> 04:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
while and nothing's changed and
 
04:06:23.149 --> 04:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes the only way to change things
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
is through a law and by this law and by
 
04:06:28.990 --> 04:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
removing that phrase I feel that it can
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
improve it even more and and and and
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
make those new uh beds that are being
 
04:06:36.750 --> 04:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
developed dedicate some of those beds to
 
04:06:40.349 --> 04:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
this population your the agency that you
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
know you worked with for so long they're
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
the ones equipped to deal with people in
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis not the ER it doesn't
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
matter whether the person has autism
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
Down syndrome an intellectual disability
 
04:06:54.960 --> 04:06:56.070 align:start position:0%
Down syndrome an intellectual disability
or

04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:06:58.830 --> 04:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
anything that mental
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
health is is is equipped to deal with it
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
and whether that person goes in for
 
04:07:06.870 --> 04:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
short term for a issue while the Breer
 
04:07:10.269 --> 04:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
of Developmental PL finds a a s you know
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't return home and they
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
need to go into residential placement ER
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
is not the place to stabilize them the
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Organization is and so
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we want to improve the
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
overall uh delivery of services and make
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
it um a fair to everyone follow up
 
04:07:30.389 --> 04:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
follow up I I know I'm not going to get
 
04:07:34.269 --> 04:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
any place with my point of view I'm
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
hoping that somebody from the Department
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh you have to ask a question you can't
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
department actually I don't believe any
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
fromone from the Department is here at
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
least not sign up yet but um let me just
 
04:07:58.830 --> 04:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
say would would you believe that perhaps
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature might form a study
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
committee to look into the concern that
 
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
you have I mean I I don't think that
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
complicated I think you can avoid that
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
whole delay and just remove the phrase
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
and then let the parties work it out
 
04:08:16.189 --> 04:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
together um you know committees study
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
committees are good but I I think that
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's you know I I think it's a really
 
04:08:25.469 --> 04:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
common sense and clear um uh solution to
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
this and if I thought otherwise I'd say
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
so but I I don't thank you very much
 
04:08:32.189 --> 04:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
 
04:08:32.199 --> 04:08:33.550 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
representative

04:08:33.550 --> 04:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
Merchant I I think my question was
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
really a followup to the questions of
 
04:08:40.109 --> 04:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
both representatives of merchant and
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
kofalt and was based
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
on the question
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
of uh autism not being exactly the same
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
thing as an intellectual disability it's
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
not that there may be overlap but there
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
may not and and I think your answer to
 
04:08:58.960 --> 04:09:00.349 align:start position:0%
may not and and I think your answer to
representative

04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
kofalt um may have clarified the issue
 
04:09:05.590 --> 04:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
for all of us and are you still saying
 
04:09:09.550 --> 04:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
that it's okay to uh that perhaps use
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
autism as a specific add in that second
 
04:09:16.269 --> 04:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
that that last part of the statute you
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
know well yeah I wouldn't be opposed to
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
that but then I'd be worried that well
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
people with Down Syndrome they're like
 
04:09:23.550 --> 04:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
well he doesn't my my kid doesn't I
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't think he has autism he has Down
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
syndrome now what about him I don't know
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know I just feel like intellectual
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
disability so is is comprehensive enough
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
I may have a followup but but my problem
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.399 --> 04:09:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
necessarily

04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
coextensive with autism you could have
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
somebody with
 
04:09:47.000 --> 04:09:49.469 align:start position:0%
somebody with
autism

04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
autism
 
04:09:49.479 --> 04:09:51.990 align:start position:0%
autism
who

04:09:51.990 --> 04:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:09:58.109 --> 04:09:58.119 align:start position:0%
is very high functioning who then has
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
mental health issues coexisting with
 
04:10:01.680 --> 04:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
mental health issues coexisting with
their

04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:10:06.510 --> 04:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
autism and I'm I'm speaking from
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge of a member I don't want what
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to work at is the language
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
that will include all the people we want
 
04:10:19.389 --> 04:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
to include and not exclude some maybe in
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the tag could be shall not exclude uh
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disabilities
 
04:10:27.149 --> 04:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
people with Autism people with Down
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
Syndrome um who have co-occurring you
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
know um diagnosis or or symptoms it's
 
04:10:34.590 --> 04:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
not really even diagnosis because they
 
04:10:37.149 --> 04:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten it yet um you know I
 
04:10:39.149 --> 04:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
think removing the term intellectual
 
04:10:42.670 --> 04:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
disability um autism technically like I
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
said I think a lot of medical providers
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
equate that term with autism but you're
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
right certainly there's people who uh
 
04:10:50.670 --> 04:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
don't have an intellectual disability
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
and if they say the word autism but if
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
that word phrase is removed I think that
 
04:10:57.750 --> 04:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
removes that technically that
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
presumption for anything you know
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
there's no technically no presumption
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
that they autism isn't in there it's
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
grouped under intellectual disabilities
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
so once you remove intellectual
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities um you know to me that
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
falls under that umbrella and that they
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
would have no they would have no basis
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
even now of denying them Services if
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
there was no evidence of an intellectual
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
disability uh I think that they they may
 
04:11:26.830 --> 04:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
at some time but um if if they you
 
04:11:30.429 --> 04:11:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
Merchant my question was answered okay
 
04:11:34.439 --> 04:11:35.910 align:start position:0%
Merchant my question was answered okay
other

04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions saying not thank you okay
 
04:11:38.640 --> 04:11:41.349 align:start position:0%
questions saying not thank you okay
thank

04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Karen
 
04:11:45.990 --> 04:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg from the disability rights
 
04:11:48.109 --> 04:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
Center of New
 
04:11:51.790 --> 04:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you've got three
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon I'm Karen
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center the state's
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
protection and advocacy system I've held
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
the role as policy director for just a
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
little over two years and for the 15
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
years prior to that I represented
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
clients in kinds of matters involving
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
their disability and I can tell you that
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's pretty common in our office to hear
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
from people with who experience a
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
developmental disability or intellectual
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
disability to be denied services from
 
04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Center and
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and it's problematic it feels kind of
 
04:12:26.070 --> 04:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
like a nimy situation not in my backyard
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
because you've got someone who
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
experiences both an intellectual
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
disability and a mental health
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
impairment and then they you know go to
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
the area agency the area agency says
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
well you got you got to go to the mental
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
health agency because you're really you
 
04:12:40.830 --> 04:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
know you're in the throws of a mental
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
health crisis and they go to the mental
 
04:12:44.349 --> 04:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
health agency who says uh not so much
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
because you've got a developmental
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
disability or an intellectual disability
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
and so you're really not ours and then
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the person's nobody's and when I've
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
represented clients who experience
 
04:12:57.750 --> 04:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
co-occurring developmental disabilities
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
and mental health impairments who are
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to have Private health
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
insurance they are able to get their
 
04:13:05.550 --> 04:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
needs met they get both you know they
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
get all the needs met they get their
 
04:13:08.830 --> 04:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
development needs met they get through
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
the medical system they get their mental
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
health needs met through their private
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
practitioners and it seems really
 
04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unfair that our law on the
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
books would preclude people from being
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
able who experience developmental
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities or intellectual
 
04:13:25.109 --> 04:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities from getting those Services
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
I understand there are some um Community
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers that are doing a
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
really good job of collaborating and are
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
seeing people who experience both but
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
the fact is our current law is something
 
04:13:40.229 --> 04:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
that another mental health agency can
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
rely on to deny services to someone who
 
04:13:45.790 --> 04:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
really needs it so for all those reasons
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
our um the disability rights Center
 
04:13:50.109 --> 04:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
strongly supports passage of this bill
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
04:13:54.030 --> 04:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
 
04:13:54.040 --> 04:13:56.389 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
representative

04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm just still trying to explore
 
04:14:02.269 --> 04:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
this um concept of Are We being broad
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
enough are we being inclusive enough and
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
um as I'm looking up dsm5
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'm realizing that I may not have had
 
04:14:16.910 --> 04:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
the proper definition of intellectual
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
disability but the subject of De
 
04:14:19.080 --> 04:14:20.429 align:start position:0%
disability but the subject of De
developmental

04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities has also been raised in
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
this context and I'm wondering what you
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
think about the inclusion of those with
 
04:14:30.990 --> 04:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities as well as
 
04:14:34.229 --> 04:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities so I think so
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the second part of
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
the bill right so it currently or is
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
that addressed elsewhere in statute if
 
04:14:42.109 --> 04:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know no I think it would need to be
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill that you would need to make
 
04:14:47.309 --> 04:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
it clear and and one other thing you
 
04:14:49.710 --> 04:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
might consider is getting rid of the
 
04:14:51.109 --> 04:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
double negative I think there was some
 
04:14:52.830 --> 04:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
confusion about what the double negative
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
meant um was making my head hurt you
 
04:14:56.830 --> 04:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
might want to consider a language like
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
an individual shall not be denied
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
Services Under this chapter on the basis
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
of co-occurrence of mental illness and
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
an intellectual or developmental
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
disability now I think developmental
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
disability encompasses autism there are
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
people behind me who know more about
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
this than me another population that is
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
not included in this that you might
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
consider are people who have exper who
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
have brain injuries because those are
 
04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
also folks who can who may have
 
04:15:28.750 --> 04:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
co-occurring mental illness along with
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
having experienced a brain injury who
 
04:15:31.750 --> 04:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
could also benefit for mental health
 
04:15:34.630 --> 04:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
services so it this may also present an
 
04:15:37.229 --> 04:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ensure that those those
 
04:15:39.790 --> 04:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
folks aren't similarly denied
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
Services thank you that's very help
 
04:15:42.159 --> 04:15:43.950 align:start position:0%
Services thank you that's very help
other

04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:15:46.590 --> 04:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Coachman thank
 
04:15:48.030 --> 04:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for being
 
04:15:50.349 --> 04:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
here and taking my question um we're
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
starting to build a bigger list of um
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
groups of people who we don't want to
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
exclude and I as I'm listening um I'm a
 
04:16:01.950 --> 04:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
nurse and I've had many patients I I
 
04:16:03.750 --> 04:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the geriatric population
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
primarily patients with dementia um who
 
04:16:10.670 --> 04:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
many are on psychiatric medications um
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
and so I just have concerns about these
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
um adding all of these categories that
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
we going to inadvertently miss somebody
 
04:16:21.550 --> 04:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
um what are your thoughts on that um
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
that that is really interesting I mean
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
one thing you could do you could
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
consider is a um sort of a catch all
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to situation
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
um and probably a clinician would be a
 
04:16:35.309 --> 04:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
better person to craft the language for
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
you but it might be
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know you could have something like
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
you know a cur a
 
04:16:43.109 --> 04:16:43.119 align:start position:0%
co-occurring um let's see basis of a
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
co-occurrence of mental illness and an
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
intellectual developmental um or other
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
condition you know
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
impacting I don't know some kind of
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
brain functioning but like I said I I
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
would defer to a clinician to really get
 
04:17:00.030 --> 04:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
the exact language for you but that's a
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
really good point because you're correct
 
04:17:04.149 --> 04:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
people who experience dementia often are
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
in this situation where especially in
 
04:17:08.349 --> 04:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
the beginning throws they are experienc
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of anxiety and benefit from
 
04:17:12.870 --> 04:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
medication and some
 
04:17:15.870 --> 04:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
therapy other
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:17:18.399 --> 04:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon good afternoon
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
you you did ask for five minutes sir if
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
you could keep it to three I appreciate
 
04:17:44.269 --> 04:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
it I think I'm G to keep it very quick
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of other voices in the
 
04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
room that are far more educated uh
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
personally and and experientially than
 
04:17:52.830 --> 04:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
myself uh my name is matth cero I'm the
 
04:17:55.349 --> 04:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
CEO of on Sky Community Services I'm
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
here representing my organization my
 
04:17:59.309 --> 04:17:59.319 align:start position:0%
organization only not our trade
 
04:18:01.389 --> 04:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
Association and not any other Area
 
04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Agency in the state so I just want to be
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
very clear um over the last four years
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
I've been CEO of on Sky Community
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
Services we've had um last year we had
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
14 people come to the ER that had some
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
coing issues um but we've had five um
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
individual cases that uh including uh
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
Miss sanx uh son and another individual
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we have in the the room today um
 
04:18:28.590 --> 04:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
that could have significantly benefited
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
from Intervention had this uh language
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
not been in the
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at individuals sitting
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
languishing in emergency rooms and not
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
because the hospital doesn't want to
 
04:18:45.149 --> 04:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
provide the care not because the mental
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
health services um Center can't do it it
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's just purely for the fact of this is
 
04:18:52.469 --> 04:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
what the course of business is as an
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
area agency we contract with our
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
community behavioral mental health
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
center uh we have a memorandum of
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
understanding we work very well with
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
them this would give us the flexibility
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
and ability to do better work and to
 
04:19:05.229 --> 04:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
prevent people from having to languish
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
in emergency rooms to get them into the
 
04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
um services that they need uh by having
 
04:19:12.070 --> 04:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
the support and medical interventions
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
that are necessary
 
04:19:19.870 --> 04:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
um we're lucky um my region is very um
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
we have a very good meal Community
 
04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center they work with us
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
they're Li they are the system itself
 
04:19:29.469 --> 04:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
into representative M's uh point of view
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're over tax they don't have
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
the the funding and they don't have the
 
04:19:36.269 --> 04:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
Manpower um to really even meet the
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
needs that that they have right now but
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
what this does is it uncuff us allows us
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
to work work hand inand um to be able to
 
04:19:46.750 --> 04:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
provide the services that need to be
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
provided um so that we can close this
 
04:19:51.149 --> 04:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
Gap and move forward um there's some
 
04:19:53.790 --> 04:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
other language that's being suggested um
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the in the s best way I can describe
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
it um I would suggest keeping it simple
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
so that the greatest amount of people
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
can be included into to this bill um
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
because we have indviduals with
 
04:20:09.229 --> 04:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities intellectual
 
04:20:12.510 --> 04:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities um or you know just
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
different varying challenges Trauma from
 
04:20:15.040 --> 04:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
different varying challenges Trauma from
brain

04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
brain
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
injuries um um there's just a lot and
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
the list could be endless you can
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
exclude someone inadvertently or or not
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
um so I I would just caution that you
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
keep it as broad as
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
possible but thank
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions
 
04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative anagel thank you Mr
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely love my job because all my
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
patients are tweeners they don't fit
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
into cubby holes and I that's basically
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
why we're creating models of integrated
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
care which I think may be a solution to
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
this but I really struggle with that
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
first paragraph and I wanted your
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
opinion I I really don't think it's
 
04:20:59.149 --> 04:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to strike out in I understand
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
why you want to do it but I think it's a
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
mistake to do strike out the
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability but I would
 
04:21:06.510 --> 04:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
really rather focus on that last line
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
kind of paragraph
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
two um that you can't I think it's sad
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be in there but I
 
04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
understand why the comorbidity point you
 
04:21:17.070 --> 04:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
can't deny people and I'm just curious
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
what you think about that I I think you
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
should strike the the verbiage and I
 
04:21:24.269 --> 04:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
speak from a practical standpoint the
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
majority of my job is fighting with
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
people um which is great because I'm
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
contentious in nature so um but
 
04:21:36.109 --> 04:21:36.119 align:start position:0%
realistically um fighting with hospitals
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
fighting with you know whoever um and
 
04:21:40.349 --> 04:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's fighting with the
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
hospital to fight with someone else in
 
04:21:43.710 --> 04:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
order to get the care so we can get them
 
04:21:46.269 --> 04:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
out of the hospital um which by the way
 
04:21:48.750 --> 04:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
I I I say this but I I want everyone to
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
be very clear in my opinion the New
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has one of the best hospitals
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
in associations in the country and I've
 
04:21:56.590 --> 04:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
worked in a lot of different states I
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
love my partners we just vary on
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
different subjects at different times um
 
04:22:04.149 --> 04:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
but they are great to work with it's
 
04:22:06.990 --> 04:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
just we're all very strong willed people
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
um but not having having that verbiage
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
in there would be a significant benefit
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
to this population um and it it doesn't
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
seem like it's a very large change and I
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
can understand why you would want to
 
04:22:22.910 --> 04:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
keep it in there but I I can tell you
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's the people you deal with on a
 
04:22:28.269 --> 04:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis um this is where they
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
get triggered into taking these
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
indefensible positions and it will take
 
04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
me three to five days to get to the
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
right person who then will come in and
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
weigh in and say we should do this or
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um or it'll take another 3 to
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
five days beyond that person to get to
 
04:22:47.950 --> 04:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the CEO of the hospital or maybe
 
04:22:50.830 --> 04:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
the CEO of the mental health center um
 
04:22:53.109 --> 04:22:53.119 align:start position:0%
it it's there's a lot of built-in
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
unnecessary waste delay in time and if
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
we can get in there get the
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization Services necessary we
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
would probably prevent a lot of people
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
from languishing in emergency rooms we'd
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
prevent a lot of people I mean one of
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
the states in uh or attorney Sanic
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
didn't mention was Florida we sent a lot
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
of people to Florida and if anyone was
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
watching the enhancer Chronicle here's
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
my plug um we did a uh we were able to
 
04:23:19.950 --> 04:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
get a person that was in um a hospital
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
for two years out of their emergency
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
room um it took us a year to save for
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
the home we had to buy it we had to
 
04:23:27.790 --> 04:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
staff it we had to get it all fitted up
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
um we can work to get all this stuff
 
04:23:32.590 --> 04:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
done but you know roadblocks need to be
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
taken out of our
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
way follow up so are you suggesting that
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
this verbiage will allow will will no
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
longer allow certain people to stop they
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
can't pass the buck anymore essentially
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's and that's been my experience
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
other people may have varying
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
experiences in in communication that's
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
why I make the disclaimer this is my
 
04:23:56.670 --> 04:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
region my region alone and only me um
 
04:23:58.750 --> 04:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
but and again I can't express my
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
gratitude for the partners that we have
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have a great system of Health mental
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
health care we have a great system of
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care in our state um this just is
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
a crack that we need to fill and it's a
 
04:24:10.269 --> 04:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
very easy
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
wber thank you I keep looking at the
 
04:24:21.149 --> 04:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
words here and you know keep the more I
 
04:24:24.910 --> 04:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
read the more I see so uh looking at
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through
 
04:24:31.469 --> 04:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
21 um I I took into account the
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
suggestion of taking out the double
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
negative and having that read an
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
individual shall not be denied Services
 
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
Under this chapter on the basis of
 
04:24:43.269 --> 04:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
co-occurrence and it says mental illness
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
and it does have an intellectual or
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
developmental disability already in
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
there although it's not in the upper
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
part because it wasn't there to begin
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
with um my question is do we need to add
 
04:25:02.670 --> 04:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
um the acquired brain disorders in there
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
uh so or am I just making things too
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
complicated I know you started out by
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
saying keep it too s keep it simple no I
 
04:25:12.990 --> 04:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
if as you get to know me better I love
 
04:25:17.950 --> 04:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
to over complicate things I so
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
um my problem is I have not personally
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
had the experience with an ASD um person
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
acquired uh prior brain disorder um or
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
AB ABD person um we're trying to get
 
04:25:33.750 --> 04:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
them services but I
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
have I've heard of issues um and I don't
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
want I bring that up but I don't want to
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
color that with that was someone else's
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
like I don't want to speak for any other
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
regions let me be very clear of that um
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
so I guess strike that part of the
 
04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry fair fair enough

that individuals with intellectual

individuals with intellectual

published in the Journal of intellectual
 
04:27:36.510 --> 04:27:36.520 align:start position:0%

individuals with intellectual

04:27:43.109 --> 04:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
than in the general
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
population furthermore individuals with
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities often
 
04:27:49.109 --> 04:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
experience unique challenges in

recognizing and expressing their mental

fine are there any
 
04:29:25.309 --> 04:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
04:29:31.269 --> 04:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm going to ask you the
 
04:29:33.389 --> 04:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
same question I asked before because I
 
04:29:36.750 --> 04:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
think you said that as written now this
 
04:29:40.269 --> 04:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
excludes people with
 
04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
um with intellectual disabilities from
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
um from from people identified as me
 
04:29:53.229 --> 04:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
with mental illness and I
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
just does it exclude people with
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities or does it
 
04:30:00.030 --> 04:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
just say that
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
people who are primarily
 
04:30:04.640 --> 04:30:06.149 align:start position:0%
people who are primarily
affected

04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
affected
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
whose impairment is primarily caused by
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
um an intellectual disability should not
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
be considered mentally ill only if they
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
have a a co-occurring disorder of mental
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
illness and intellectual
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%

you've indicated you wanted four but if
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
you could keep it to closer to three
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
that'd be great I will do the best I can

um say my career may have come by choice
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
but my path was one of necessity in 2000
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
my friends and family members with
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I experienced a series
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
of several unexpected
 
04:32:45.870 --> 04:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
events at the time I was encouraged to
 
04:32:48.030 --> 04:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
seek therapy to support my adjustment
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
through such significant loss however my
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
cousin was unable to access therapy to
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
process the loss of her mother my friend
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
was unable to access a therapist to
 
04:33:01.349 --> 04:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
support the TR tragic sudden passing of
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
his brother and my two friends who were
 
04:33:06.910 --> 04:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
sisters were unable to access mental
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
health supports to add to address the
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
loss of their brother from the very same
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
genetic condition that they knew would
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
someday and have since taken their own
 
04:33:20.590 --> 04:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
lives all had limited access because of
 
04:33:22.029 --> 04:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
the presence of their
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities this was unfair during
 
04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
their times of Devastation and truly
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
discriminatory as they continued to
 
04:33:30.670 --> 04:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
struggle with access to mental health
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
care and the years to
 
04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
follow in my career as a new Hampshire
 
04:33:38.230 --> 04:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker it is my mission
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all people regardless of

ability or disability have equal access
 
04:33:47.551 --> 04:33:47.561 align:start position:0%
to mental health care including informed
 
04:33:50.910 --> 04:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
assessments from trained Professionals
 
04:33:53.230 --> 04:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
in my clinical work I support hundreds
 
04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
of indivi I have supported hundreds of
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
individuals with co-occurring
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities brain injuries
 
04:34:03.750 --> 04:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
and mental health needs I receive I have
 
04:34:06.869 --> 04:34:06.879 align:start position:0%
received multiple calls mon monthly and
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes even weekly requesting
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
advocacy support and accessing Mental
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
Health Services due to being denied
 
04:34:15.310 --> 04:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
based on primary
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%

those with intellectual disabilities
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
experience mental health needs as
 
04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
compared to roughly 20% of the general
 
04:34:28.119 --> 04:34:30.189 align:start position:0%

American

American
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
population for those with ID
 
04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
co-occurring mental illness is around
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
40% with persistent mental illness
 
04:34:37.799 --> 04:34:39.109 align:start position:0%

around

04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
30% those with ID are three to six times
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
more likely to
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
experience abuse neglect or exploitation
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
while the majority of those with ID
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
experience trauma in their
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
lifetime I ask you to take that
 
04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
in it is our responsibility to stop
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
requiring a focus on primary diagnosis
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
and allow for our clinical
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
communities to foster a whole person
 
04:35:11.470 --> 04:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
approach to care it is imperative that
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
all individuals regardless of a
 
04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
developmental diagnosis have access to
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
mental health assessments and are
 
04:35:20.750 --> 04:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
supported from a whole person approach
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
to care all of us have our primary needs
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
change based on our mental health
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
symptoms daily stresses Etc we cannot
 
04:35:32.189 --> 04:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
determine what came first the chicken or
 
04:35:33.869 --> 04:35:33.879 align:start position:0%
the egg if you could please start
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
wrapping up yep I ask that we hold our
 
04:35:39.150 --> 04:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Community responsible for
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
supporting all people as people based on
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
their presenting needs I urge you to
 
04:35:49.709 --> 04:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of HB 1028 to support the
 
04:35:51.869 --> 04:35:51.879 align:start position:0%
necessary steps in moving towards a
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
community that supports equality and
 
04:35:56.349 --> 04:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
mental health services for all New
 
04:35:58.349 --> 04:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens thank you for your
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
time and
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll try
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
again you seem to have extensive
 
04:36:21.070 --> 04:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
experience uh is is there special
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
training that's different from the
 
04:36:27.869 --> 04:36:27.879 align:start position:0%
training for people who treat midle ill
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
patients uh because it it sounds as if
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
what what you're saying is that
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the U Middle health system is not
 
04:36:42.750 --> 04:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of
 
04:36:45.551 --> 04:36:45.561 align:start position:0%
individuals with intellectual
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
disability can can you define what an
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability is I think I
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
know but can can you uh help us that way
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely so an intellectual disability
 
04:37:02.830 --> 04:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
is something that is experienced within
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
the is um an impairment experience
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
within the developmental age I could get
 
04:37:11.070 --> 04:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
into the DSM in in all of the criteria
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
um but I think that would be a longer
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
conversation than we we certainly have
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
time for um however um to go to your
 
04:37:25.789 --> 04:37:25.799 align:start position:0%
question um about training um uh
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
attorney senok mentioned about the dmid
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
to um that is published by the National
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
Association of the duly diagnosed where
 
04:37:35.230 --> 04:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
I've had the pleasure of presenting ing
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
at some of their um national uh
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
conferences in the state of Ohio a
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
couple of times um they are that is that
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
should be um in my opinion um the
 
04:37:49.629 --> 04:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
standard of care when um providing
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services and diagnosing of
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions for individuals
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
with uh who experience intellectual and
 
04:37:59.949 --> 04:37:59.959 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities it speaks to
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
um the criter it compares the criteria
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
of our diagnostic I tool of the DSM 5
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
which we use um I'm sure you're familiar
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
from the medical field um but in mental
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
health we use the DSM um as our
 
04:38:18.029 --> 04:38:18.039 align:start position:0%
diagnostic tool the dmid um takes into
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
consideration presentation that would
 
04:38:23.709 --> 04:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
come from in intellectual disability and
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
it provides um a comparison to ensure
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
that we're taking everything into
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
consideration it helps prevent
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic overshadowing and that's what
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
we see in our
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
population over and over and over again
 
04:38:39.551 --> 04:38:39.561 align:start position:0%
we label People based on diagnosis ah
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's the intellectual disability it's
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
the brain injury however our statistics
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
tell us that people are people and
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disabilities
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
are statistically more likely to
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
experience mental illness than their
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
neurotypical peers um we have the right
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
and responsibility to diagnose with the
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate tools be trained on those um
 
04:39:04.990 --> 04:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
and then also um have trainings and
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
appreciate you asking further trainings
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
for our mental health professionals um
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
to broaden our skill sets so people
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
aren't excluded based off of talk
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
therapy Alone um my most beneficial
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
sessions sometimes have been sitting on
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
the floor um and providing therapy and
 
04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh we do what it takes for our
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you representative
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question I really appreciate
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I have a
 
04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
concern that you raised that kind of
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
reflects what I was talking about
 
04:39:40.350 --> 04:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
earlier in terms of striking out
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability and including
 
04:39:44.110 --> 04:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
that as a mental disability my concern
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
now is that that will suddenly become an
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
axis one
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and wouldn't that un have the
 
04:39:53.948 --> 04:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunate side effect of saying um
 
04:39:56.110 --> 04:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
that oh you have an intellectual
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
disability we don't cover that we only
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
cover psychiatric diagnosis so I'm
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
afraid that that change will actually
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
exclude these people using DSM criteria
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
my my very very genuine hope is that
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
striking the language of intellectual
 
04:40:14.760 --> 04:40:16.868 align:start position:0%
striking the language of intellectual
disability

04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
um if we do not if I'm interpreting this
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
correctly and I want to pull it out to
 
04:40:24.750 --> 04:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're they I'm seeing the
 
04:40:27.390 --> 04:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
same thing you are
 
04:40:32.190 --> 04:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
um where it states it does not include
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
impairment primarily caused by
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
the words primary impairment scare
 
04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
me they they frighten me to my core as a
 
04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
clinician there is a significant and as
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
a family member to be honest and I I
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear that I am sitting
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
here not only as a professional but the
 
04:40:54.670 --> 04:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
first hat and the most important hat I
 
04:40:58.990 --> 04:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
advocate I fear the Discrimination that
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
will continue if we allow people to be
 
04:41:09.030 --> 04:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
labeled by a primary diagnosis because
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
that is nearly
 
04:41:14.350 --> 04:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
impossible to provide to say what came
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
first and um so I would I'd like to say
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
that if we were to not strike that
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
language it is going to allow people to
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
continue to be discriminated against
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
based on disability and withhold the or
 
04:41:34.270 --> 04:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
possibly withhold the ability for them
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
to even access initial um assessments
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
that may those initial assessments are
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
imperative to identify do they have a SE
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
severe persistent mental illness do they
 
04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for services in community mental
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
health or at Mental Health Centers um I
 
04:41:55.070 --> 04:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
urge you to maybe think about somebody
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
who experiences autism and skit um
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
schizo effective disorder or a a
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorder um some of the one of
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
the people that I have treated for a
 
04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
very long time I can't tell you what's
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
primary for that person um on any given
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
day on a very great day and and that
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
person's taking their
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
medication he's he's doing fabulously in
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
autism probably primary that day because
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
he's stable he's getting all of the
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
services he needs um he's getting
 
04:42:29.550 --> 04:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
wraparound Services medications are
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
going well and he's an active member of
 
04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
and valued member of his community
 
04:42:36.270 --> 04:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
however ever when medications are not
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
stable if he's not consistent in
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
Services his symptoms of schizo
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
effective disorder or um any other
 
04:42:46.510 --> 04:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
psychotic disorder will amplify they'll
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
exacerbate and in that moment that is
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
his primary impairment in functioning I
 
04:42:54.190 --> 04:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
can't tell you what's the overall in his
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
life primary impairment and functioning
 
04:42:57.990 --> 04:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
we have to treat them equally and we
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
need to treat people as
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as I
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
listen to these conversations I'm
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually more concerned now than I was
 
04:43:18.670 --> 04:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
before when I think of autism it's sort
 
04:43:19.628 --> 04:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
spectrum you can go somebody very high
 
04:43:24.190 --> 04:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
functioning on autism and somebody on
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
the other end who's
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
not is not epilepsy the same way there
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
are people who have epilepsy who are on
 
04:43:34.030 --> 04:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
sort of a spectrum too there all forms
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
of EP epilepsy there are some epilepsies
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
that really cause tremendous emotional
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
disturbance for a child sometimes an
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
adult to the point where they cannot
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
learn effectively and so forth so why
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
are we leaving epilepsy in there and not
 
04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with that one at the same
 
04:43:55.868 --> 04:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
time that's a a very valid question um
 
04:43:59.948 --> 04:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
my experience as a um professional and
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
loved one is um in the area of
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
disability I do not have the um
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
background or education per se in the
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
medical field which I do feel epilepsy
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
would be more in the realm of the
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
medical um so I would be remiss to to
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
speak to that um directly um medical
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
conditions certainly have an impact on
 
04:44:27.868 --> 04:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
Mental Health I see that every single
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
day um I can tell you that when my kids
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't feel well their mental health
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
changes when I don't feel well my mental
 
04:44:36.190 --> 04:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
health changes that is certainly that is
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
certainly valid um however
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
um when because I can speak to my
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
expertise in intellectual and
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disability um this is
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
something that we have seen as a stigma
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
that has occurred
 
04:44:56.948 --> 04:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
since well really forever it comes from
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
that period of institutionalization
 
04:45:02.190 --> 04:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
where we have been told as long as my
 
04:45:03.750 --> 04:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues and I can remember that
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
people it's disabilities it has the
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
language has been used people are too
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
disabled to have mental health needs
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're too disabled to feel those
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
mental health needs and we know that is
 
04:45:16.830 --> 04:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
not true um so I know that I'm certainly
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
going on a tangent separate from your
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
question um but I can speak to my area
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
of expertise and I'm sorry that I can't
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
speak to the medical but um we do have a
 
04:45:28.110 --> 04:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility for these individuals who
 
04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
um experience intellectual disabilities
 
04:45:32.910 --> 04:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
and autism and brain injury to Advocate
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
to decrease that stigma
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Nel U
 
04:45:39.670 --> 04:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I figured out what
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask and I would thank
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for helping me
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
so my psychology is old that's right but
 
04:45:50.430 --> 04:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's been a bar large part of my career
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't use the DSM regularly but my
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that when we make
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
mental health decisions we're focusing
 
04:46:01.590 --> 04:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
on access one and so like we can put
 
04:46:04.390 --> 04:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
autism and epilepsy and all those other
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
things in axis 3 but those people
 
04:46:07.948 --> 04:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
commonly have mental health issues as
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
well so making these
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
decisions you're using the axis one
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
definition and we're basically tell
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're saying well we're not
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to pay attention the axis one
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're just going to stand around treat
 
04:46:21.150 --> 04:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
you because the Axis Three my concern is
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
that getting back to what I asked before
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
if we strike out intellectual
 
04:46:27.548 --> 04:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
disability all of the sudden now we're
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
promoting intellectual disability to an
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
AIS one diagnosis and they can just say
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to treat this person
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
because we only treat psychiatric
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
illnesses that's my concern is we're
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to make a bigger problem than than
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
than we've got now that's my big
 
04:46:43.920 --> 04:46:46.868 align:start position:0%
than we've got now that's my big
concern

04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
I I do hear where you're coming from I
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
would argue
 
04:46:55.150 --> 04:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
that from my
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
perspective I feel there is no bigger
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
problem than blatant discrimination and
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
I do feel that in the language that is
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
here right now there blatant
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination that indicates that it
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
will not include people primarily
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with an intellectual
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
disability and that says to me not you
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
not your loved one um and we need to
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
have people be able to at least access
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate assessments so
 
04:47:25.510 --> 04:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
determinations can be made this language
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
as it stands prevents people from
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate assessment and that is quite
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous um from my perspective
 
04:47:34.760 --> 04:47:36.670 align:start position:0%
dangerous um from my perspective
other

04:47:36.670 --> 04:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying none thank you
 
04:47:43.470 --> 04:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.750 --> 04:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.910 --> 04:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
Turner good afternoon hello uh once
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
again you've asked for five minutes if
 
04:48:00.510 --> 04:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
you can keep it to three i' appreciate
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'll TR I mean I prepared it this
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
testimony all day yesterday I'm the
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
parent of um what the CEO once said it's
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
the poster child of this
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
problem um I just want to um if I do my
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
job correctly it everyone here will will
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
see the obvious need to strike
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability from the
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
language of the statute um because my
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
son um is dually diagnosed with autism
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
some intellectual impairment so
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability and mental
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
illness and I was told that by a
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and it's been my experience
 
04:48:39.990 --> 04:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
that people have a hard time
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
understanding his a his autism looks
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
really different because of trauma that
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
he experienced in his anxiety problems
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
makes him look more autistic and his
 
04:48:48.990 --> 04:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
trauma his mental illness looks a little
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
bit different because he's autistic and
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
it just manifests differently and you
 
04:48:54.868 --> 04:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
can't really parse out someone's brain
 
04:48:58.350 --> 04:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
and say this is It's you know 40% autism
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
or something um uh so I'm just going to
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
read my statement um I'm the parent of a
 
04:49:08.430 --> 04:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
24-year-old son who is intellectually
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled with
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
co-occurring mental illness his
 
04:49:14.430 --> 04:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
designation as intellectually disabled
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
leads to the denial of mental health
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
treatment no matter how hard I try to
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
get him access to Mental Health
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
Services my son has experienced
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crises which have led him to
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
hospital ERS numerous times including
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Regional Hospital Wentworth
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
Douglas hospital exor hospital Elliot
 
04:49:35.470 --> 04:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital um conquered hospital and even
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
a hospital of
 
04:49:39.788 --> 04:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um each time his crisis is
 
04:49:42.670 --> 04:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
triggered by obsessive worries and
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
stress um despite diagnosis in
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
documentation of his mental illness he
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
is diagnosed with obsessive compulsive
 
04:49:52.030 --> 04:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
disorder and incidentally about 20% of
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
autistic people have
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
OCD um my son has been denied access
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
despite diagnosis the reason because
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
he's autistic and considered
 
04:50:06.628 --> 04:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
intellectually um disabled I hope not to
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
offend you when I say that it feels like
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
he's being punished continually for the
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
crime of being an autistic person who
 
04:50:14.948 --> 04:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
happens to also experience mental
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
illness I see that the state settled a
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit over acute mental health
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
patients being held involuntarily in
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency departments awaiting
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
treatment my son's situation and that of
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
other individuals with intellectual
 
04:50:29.670 --> 04:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities in psychiatric crisis is
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
even worse they don't even get deemed
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for mental health treatment
 
04:50:36.670 --> 04:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
they boarded in the ER without any
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
treatment whether doctors or mental
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
health CL clinicians nor any help to
 
04:50:43.150 --> 04:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
know what the next step would be nor any
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
guidance from staff as to where they go
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
to get assistance this a very scary
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
situation for the patient and their
 
04:50:53.310 --> 04:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
family caused my son great confusion and
 
04:50:55.230 --> 04:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
pain to see to be stuck in the emergency
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
department to see other people seeing
 
04:50:59.948 --> 04:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors and they even
 
04:51:01.350 --> 04:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
when I asked they would refuse to even
 
04:51:01.360 --> 04:51:02.390 align:start position:0%
when I asked they would refuse to even
see

04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
him uh even when he was there for weeks
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
and months at a time my son sits for
 
04:51:09.510 --> 04:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
weeks other times months waiting
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
indefinitely so in 2022 he was a month
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
in conquer Hospital Emergency Department
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 he was two months in
 
04:51:19.230 --> 04:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
emergency department at Elliot Hospital
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
and both times it was refused mental
 
04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
health clinician and um so I speak from
 
04:51:26.670 --> 04:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
this personal
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
experience um ma'am you seem to have
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
quite a statement there but could you
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up please um
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
when when my son was boarding at the ER
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the uh doctors paused a zoom
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
meeting to say we are complicit in this
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
torture of patients by engaging in a
 
04:51:49.270 --> 04:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
broken system during another time
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
barding in in an ER a different doctor
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
said it's a tragedy that people like my
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
son don't get the mental health
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
treatment that they need he'd be too
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
safe to return home without the
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
treatment but then nonetheless cleared
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
because it because he's autistic sick he
 
04:52:06.788 --> 04:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
would literally never deemed eligible
 
04:52:08.990 --> 04:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
for mental health
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
treatment um he was even threatened by
 
04:52:12.990 --> 04:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
hospital to be taken to him homeless
 
04:52:14.670 --> 04:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
shelter when he was
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
boarding I don't know if you can imagine
 
04:52:18.990 --> 04:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
how much you would suffer as a patient
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
if you were in psychiatric crisis
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
feeling unworthy and ashamed that you
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
can't control your symptoms by yourself
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
only to be told you have behavioral
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
problems you need to control in the
 
04:52:31.270 --> 04:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
meantime you will be left alone sitting
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
in a room by yourself for weeks thank
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
again please stop W Please wrap up
 
04:52:38.830 --> 04:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
months without a chair to sit
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%

either through the mental health system
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%

04:53:25.548 --> 04:53:25.558 align:start position:0%

his mental illness categorizing him as a
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%

04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
the field that you it's a combination
 
04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
that helps people get better you can't
 
04:53:55.470 --> 04:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
just give people
 
04:53:57.868 --> 04:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
drugs um in October
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
20122 my son was living in conquer in a
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
model called enhanced family care which
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
is like fer care and he had been um
 
04:54:09.070 --> 04:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
thriving enough because when we couldn't
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
get the mental health system to provide
 
04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
the treatment he needs for OCD my
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
parents his grandparents paid for out of
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
patient uh out of pocket for about a
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
year and he actually got better and
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
stabilized wasn't going to the emergency
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
department was actually able to take a
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
trip to um go to Pittsburgh where his
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
like hero Mr
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
Rogers um is from ma'am pleas and then
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
October 2022 one I'm G to have to ask
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
you okay one of his providers attempted
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
suicide in the house while he was home
 
04:54:41.548 --> 04:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
and it caused him to feel suicidal and
 
04:54:42.750 --> 04:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
he took himself to the emergency
 
04:54:44.548 --> 04:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
department and they dismissed his
 
04:54:46.548 --> 04:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
suicidality because he's autistic then
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
he attempted suicide the next day it was
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
sent back there and boarded for a month
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
and still couldn't get didn't wasn't
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
considered eligible even after a suicide
 
04:54:56.110 --> 04:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
attempt and even after having to be
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
restrained in the emergency mean they
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
just wanted to send him home but there
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
was no home to go to because it wasn't
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
really safe so what so what's happen is
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
people can I just well hurry please way
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
over your time okay I appreciate I
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it because it's like I feel
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
like it's really important you've gone
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
over the five minutes you've asked for
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
actually yeah I mean okay well I just
 
04:55:20.590 --> 04:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
want to say that individuals like my son
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
who are either like Autistic or in or
 
04:55:23.040 --> 04:55:24.708 align:start position:0%
who are either like Autistic or in or
intellectually

04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
intellectually
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
disabled they have higher mental health
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
needs and it's and I'm saying it's a
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
major barrier and the other thing I want
 
04:55:33.868 --> 04:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
to say is no one's mentioned this I
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
think this is really important like just
 
04:55:39.310 --> 04:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
like let's just like talk real what gets
 
04:55:41.470 --> 04:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
people people's attention is behavioral
 
04:55:43.948 --> 04:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
problems someone's acting unsafe
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
someone's a dangerous for other people
 
04:55:46.990 --> 04:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
and that they can't regulate their
 
04:55:49.270 --> 04:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
stress properly and that's what happens
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
and that's what gets them there the
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
problem is if you're the language in
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
here makes it easy for the hospital
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
which they always say that it's
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
agitation he's having a temper tantrum
 
04:55:59.788 --> 04:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
even though it's well documented he has
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
severe trauma ocity and anxiety problems
 
04:56:03.868 --> 04:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
it does
 
04:56:05.150 --> 04:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
they just don't want to deal with it
 
04:56:07.150 --> 04:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
because he's autistic and it's caused
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
him could could email your statement to
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
us please ma'am yes and he's been forced
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
to live out of state he's a he's a he
 
04:56:16.590 --> 04:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
he's a high school
 
04:56:18.750 --> 04:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
graduate do we does anyone have any
 
04:56:21.030 --> 04:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions and has worked and volunteered
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
in his community and now he's forced out
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
of stay in a group home away from his
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
family like only because he doesn't get
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%

minutes
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
to speak here today and good afternoon
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
representatives and valued members of
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
the community as stated my name is
 
04:57:14.430 --> 04:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
Chelsea Zarcone and I am a lifelong
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire a very proud
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
603 year I'm here today both as a
 
04:57:21.390 --> 04:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
concerned and passionate citizen as well
 
04:57:23.070 --> 04:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
as a licensed social worker and
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
certified brain injury specialist in
 
04:57:27.548 --> 04:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
1028 I have been supporting those with
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
co-occurring mental health needs with
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
developmental disability and or acquired
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
brain injury for a decade but really
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
I've been doing it since childhood I
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
grew up with a friend who was living
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
with cerebral paly and struggled to gain
 
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
inclusion to care and access to Services
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
the way the rest of his classmates had
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
as I've continued through my career I've
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
become privy to significant gaps in
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
Service delivery to those living with
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities specifically gaining access
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
to support their mental health needs I
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
speak with family members survivors of
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
brain injury those living with
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
developmental dis ability and fellow
 
04:58:06.910 --> 04:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
professionals with consistency regarding
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination that people
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
experience on a daily and weekly basis
 
04:58:13.628 --> 04:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
in all facets of care across all
 
04:58:15.910 --> 04:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
settings those living with co-occurring
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
diagnoses deserve the same level of
 
04:58:20.590 --> 04:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
access to care as their neurotypical
 
04:58:23.390 --> 04:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
Piers as it is their basic right a
 
04:58:25.750 --> 04:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
primary diagnosis of Developmental
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
disability and or required brain injury
 
04:58:29.470 --> 04:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
does not exclude someone from
 
04:58:32.310 --> 04:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing severe mental illness in
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
requiring specialized in informed care
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
designated by their mental health
 
04:58:39.868 --> 04:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
professionals which is not the
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the area
 
04:58:45.390 --> 04:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
agency regardless of our stance
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
political views or backgrounds we're all
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
in this room because we want better for
 
04:58:52.350 --> 04:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents in the state we
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
love as a social worker and human it's
 
04:58:57.310 --> 04:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
my ethical and moral imperative
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
imperative to ask today that HB 1028 be
 
04:59:03.150 --> 04:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
passed as it's a necessary step towards
 
04:59:05.430 --> 04:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
Equitable access and towards this
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
betterment I ask today that you the
 
04:59:09.670 --> 04:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
representatives and committee consider
 
04:59:11.590 --> 04:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
that if somebody with a developmental
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
disability and brain injury does not
 
04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
discriminate is not discriminated having
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
this diagnosis why should the mental
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
Healthcare discriminate against them and
 
04:59:24.670 --> 04:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
to your point representative McKay our
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
system has come a very long way and I'm
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
very proud of that for our state and the
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
ask for this bill is just to continue to
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
push it forward thank you
 
04:59:33.760 --> 04:59:34.948 align:start position:0%
push it forward thank you
thank

04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:59:38.590 --> 04:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative
 
04:59:40.990 --> 04:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you as a brain injury
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
specialist maybe you're the right person
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
to have asked the question uh if we pass
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
the bill as it was submitted to us does
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
it sufficiently cover the population
 
04:59:53.948 --> 04:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
with brain injuries or do we need to add
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
that as a
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
specific I would say adding it in
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
specifically and the reason I say that
 
05:00:01.390 --> 05:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
is because a developmental disability
 
05:00:04.750 --> 05:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
which includes ID and or Autism is
 
05:00:06.270 --> 05:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
something that somebody has as
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
previously stated in their developmental
 
05:00:11.230 --> 05:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
age however anybody any of us in this
 
05:00:13.548 --> 05:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
room can experience a brain injury at
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
any time and the reason I also highlight
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
it is that individuals with brain
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
injuries are also served specifically by
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
their area agencies I have a
 
05:00:26.670 --> 05:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
follow and do a followup thank you and
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up what is the specific
 
05:00:32.548 --> 05:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
technical term that you would recommend
 
05:00:34.830 --> 05:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
because we've said brain injury we've
 
05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
said acquired brain disorder and I am
 
05:00:39.628 --> 05:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
without the technical knowledge to
 
05:00:41.470 --> 05:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
understand which of those formulations
 
05:00:45.070 --> 05:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
is the correct one yes um it's a very
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
good point I would use acquired brain
 
05:00:50.590 --> 05:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
injury or acquired brain disorder and
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that I specify acquired brain
 
05:00:54.990 --> 05:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
disorder is that the ABD waiver which is
 
05:00:57.390 --> 05:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
something that people
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
with an acquired brain injury um some of
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
there are specifics around it however
 
05:01:06.430 --> 05:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
um it is something that area agencies
 
05:01:08.590 --> 05:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
also offer so if we're looking for that
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
continuity that is language that area
 
05:01:14.590 --> 05:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
agencies use so acquired acquired brain
 
05:01:17.350 --> 05:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
disorder yes okay as it encompasses
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
acquired brain injury as well okay thank
 
05:01:21.150 --> 05:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
you very much for that that's very
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
helpful representative
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
earlier I asked a question about the
 
05:01:33.670 --> 05:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of epilepsy yes and that also
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways like autism is on a
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
spectrum can you address that as far as
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
whether we should try to deal with it
 
05:01:42.270 --> 05:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a brain injury per se could
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
lead to one but most of the time it's
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
not the issue however severe epilepsy
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
particular in some children cause
 
05:01:51.548 --> 05:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
problems emotionally and otherwise
 
05:01:53.310 --> 05:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
correct and I would not disagree with
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
that at all um my epilepsy as dementia I
 
05:01:59.310 --> 05:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
know was mentioned earlier there's so
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
many neurological disorders that fall
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
into their own category um what I would
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
be able to extrapolate from somebody
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
likely living with epilepsy is that they
 
05:02:10.830 --> 05:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
are going to experience psychosocial
 
05:02:13.868 --> 05:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
psychosocial challenges therefore
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing higher need for mental
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
health care um further I would say that
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
removing any sort of discriminatory
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
language from a bill doesn't do anyone
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
any harm so being able to provide access
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
to care to any sort of co-occurring
 
05:02:31.350 --> 05:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
mental health and whether it's a
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
physical um or cognitive disability is
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
just allowing further exclusion to care
 
05:02:36.680 --> 05:02:37.548 align:start position:0%
just allowing further exclusion to care
for

05:02:37.548 --> 05:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:02:39.788 --> 05:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
people representative Seth King oh I'm
 
05:02:39.798 --> 05:02:40.708 align:start position:0%
people representative Seth King oh I'm
sorry

05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair so following
 
05:02:46.030 --> 05:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
up on the terminology which I think is
 
05:02:49.470 --> 05:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
going to be critical here in saying that
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
is it neurological epy no no just saying
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
neurological disorders to some degree
 
05:02:57.628 --> 05:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're trying to get
 
05:03:00.270 --> 05:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
to with it's going to be brain acquired
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
disorder epilepsy autism that cuses
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
interference that's what we're trying to
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
get to because it's neurological in
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
nature all of it so as although I'm a
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
certified brain injury specialist I
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
cannot make neurological diagnosis I can
 
05:03:16.948 --> 05:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
make diagnoses under the DSM or the dmid
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
however epilepsy really falls into a
 
05:03:22.270 --> 05:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
medical category so I can't really speak
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to what you're asking um
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
again I would really I I don't want to
 
05:03:30.270 --> 05:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
step out of my role on that however I
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
would wager to bet again as anybody Liv
 
05:03:34.590 --> 05:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
living with a co-occurring disorder is
 
05:03:37.350 --> 05:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
probably more likely um or just likely
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
in general to be experiencing some
 
05:03:40.510 --> 05:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
mental health needs at the same
 
05:03:43.230 --> 05:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
time representative Seth K question for
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
the chair I don't know if now is the
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
best time to bring it up or not but um
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant has asked a
 
05:03:49.948 --> 05:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
question a couple of times um that I
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
also was wondering myself and I suspect
 
05:03:54.150 --> 05:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
others were as well and I talked to
 
05:03:57.390 --> 05:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
Christina and I I wanted to know um the
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
history of um AB c and d and why they
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
were put and when they were put in that
 
05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph and she said with your
 
05:04:05.708 --> 05:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
permission she could get started on that
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
so that might help elucidate a little
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
bit what's going on there cuz I felt
 
05:04:11.670 --> 05:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
like these just seem shoehorned in to
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
something that was originally there and
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
i' i' just like to know the history so
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
sure yeah Christine if you could do that
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%

when

asked mid January 2023 we brought him to
 
05:05:45.230 --> 05:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Elliot ER with concerns of increased
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
aggression self-mutilation and strange

treatment at the end of
 
05:06:04.590 --> 05:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
January we wrote an email to Community
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
Bridges stating that Kevin was in crisis
 
05:06:09.628 --> 05:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
and we were in need of support we were
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
seeking we were seeing more destructive
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior including damage to the house
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
self-mutilation and violence toward

caregivers at home and in the community
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
we were unable to bring him out into the
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
community as per usual of his day
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
program and that that we did for the
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
last eight years Community Bridges and
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
Sarah Beamish from Elliot Behavioral
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
Health recommended that that we called
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
the mobile crisis response unit to get
 
05:06:35.000 --> 05:06:35.628 align:start position:0%
the mobile crisis response unit to get
an

05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:06:38.670 --> 05:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
IA involuntary emergency admission
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
placement for
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
Kevin on February 12th the mobile crisis
 
05:06:44.830 --> 05:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
unit came to the house with the wear
 
05:06:46.750 --> 05:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
police department and decided that Kevin
 
05:06:49.310 --> 05:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
did not qualify for an IA placement
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
because of his
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
autism on February 15th we visited
 
05:06:56.590 --> 05:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
Kevin's PCP with our concerns while in
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
the office Kevin attacked his mother by
 
05:07:00.510 --> 05:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
punching her in the chest no real
 
05:07:02.110 --> 05:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
guidance was offered and we were sent
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
home home on February 16th Kevin became
 
05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
increasingly violent he was hitting and
 
05:07:09.788 --> 05:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
kicking his mother as well as slamming
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
his body into the slider Kevin's mother
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
called me to make uh me aware of the
 
05:07:17.910 --> 05:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
situation I called his primary care
 
05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
physician who recommended that we bring
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
Kevin to the Elliot emergency room for
 
05:07:26.110 --> 05:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
evaluation we called 911 and the we
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
Police Department arrived at the house
 
05:07:29.788 --> 05:07:29.798 align:start position:0%
with an ambulance and brought Kevin to
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
the Elliot Hospital emergency room in
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester the emergency department
 
05:07:37.390 --> 05:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
staff placed
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
Kevin in the PS in psychiatric
 
05:07:45.150 --> 05:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation placement P unit that is a p
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
unit in the emergency department not the
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
pro not the hospital
 
05:07:52.590 --> 05:07:52.600 align:start position:0%
proper after several hours at the pep
 
05:07:54.030 --> 05:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
they decided that it would be
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
detrimental for him to remain there
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
because of his aggression and violent
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
behavior and ask that we bring him
 
05:08:04.150 --> 05:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
home I felt it was unsafe for Kevin to
 
05:08:06.270 --> 05:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
be at home and it would also be unsafe
 
05:08:08.350 --> 05:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
for other family members if Kevin were
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
at home after several days of being
 
05:08:12.910 --> 05:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
observed in the P unit they still
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
refused to admit Kevin into the hospital
 
05:08:17.548 --> 05:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
for treatment because of his
 
05:08:22.910 --> 05:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
autism they also cited a law titled RSA
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
135-can 2 which states that anyone with
 
05:08:28.548 --> 05:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
an intellectual disability is expressly
 
05:08:30.590 --> 05:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
excluded from Mental Health Services
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
because there is a presumption that any
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
atypical behavior is caused by the
 
05:08:35.040 --> 05:08:38.708 align:start position:0%
atypical behavior is caused by the
intellectual

05:08:41.708 --> 05:08:41.718 align:start position:0%
disability Elliot Hospital stated it is
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the community to
 
05:08:46.510 --> 05:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
find a safe place for Kevin the state
 
05:08:49.070 --> 05:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
through Community Bridges declared it
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
was not their role the hospital and St
 
05:08:54.030 --> 05:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
and state went back and forth declaring
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
that neither one knew the other one's
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
role I demanded a resolution as his
 
05:09:01.830 --> 05:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
Advocate a social worker at the Elliot
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital hit and a supervisor at
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
Community Bridges both recommended that
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
Kevin go to the New Hampshire Start
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
Center I agreed to this because Kevin
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
was in crisis and her family was under
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
duress the Start Center turned out to
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
be a respit facility for adults in
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
transition crisis the staff at the Start
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
Center had no expertise with autism and
 
05:09:25.270 --> 05:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
didn't have the ability to make any
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatric or behavioral evaluations
 
05:09:29.548 --> 05:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
that were not provided at the hospital
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
we could start wrapping up
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
sir as his caregivers and Advocates we
 
05:09:36.670 --> 05:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
continue to seek out Supportive Services
 
05:09:38.548 --> 05:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral and mental health for
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%

RiverBend Community Mental Health Center
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
in conquered when we contacted them they
 
05:09:51.628 --> 05:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
informed us they could not accept Kevin
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
as a patient due to his lack of
 
05:09:55.230 --> 05:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
communication skills because he is
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
severely autistic and non-verbal they
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.310 --> 05:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
me additionally we sought out intensive
 
05:10:11.070 --> 05:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
treatment services which are provided
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
for high-risk adults with disabilities
 
05:10:14.590 --> 05:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to qualify for these
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
Services it requires Kevin to be
 
05:10:19.470 --> 05:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
identified as high- risk we sought out a
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
risk evaluation and the state wasn't
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to provide one he was denied access
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
by a Statewide committee called the
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
community of practice they stated they
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
needed documentation which shows that

Kevin's behavior is not rooted in a
 
05:10:33.868 --> 05:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
medical condition they said we do not
 
05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
have sufficient documentation of this we
 
05:10:37.948 --> 05:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
also put in a referral for Applied
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral analysis for Kevin we have
 
05:10:41.830 --> 05:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
been waiting since August for financial
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
approval from the BDS to start this
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
service for Kevin Community Bridges has
 
05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
supported and not resisted policies that
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
deny mental health rights to Kevin
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
policies that withhold Services until he
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
commits a crime and is not that is
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
nothing less than entrapment
 
05:10:59.628 --> 05:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
participating in the entrapment a
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable person represents a
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
frightening culture of misplaced public
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
trust and unchecked authority authority
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
and Trust unencumbered by self-analysis
 
05:11:10.590 --> 05:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
or sound ethical judgment is
 
05:11:12.708 --> 05:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
unacceptable there are no emergency
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
crisis services for the profoundly

autistic the Start Center is not an
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
emergency service one must undergo an
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
initial intake process it is not an

in-house psychiatric Treatment Center
 
05:11:24.990 --> 05:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
the emergency rooms in our hospitals
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
would not admit profoundly autistic
 
05:11:29.150 --> 05:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
people into the hospital and they openly
 
05:11:33.150 --> 05:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
say so citing a law en titled RSA 13 5-2
 
05:11:36.190 --> 05:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
c semicolon 2 a committee associated
 
05:11:37.510 --> 05:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
with Community Bridges known as
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
community of practice two
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
pages determined that there was not
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
enough documentation to place Kevin in
 
05:11:46.590 --> 05:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services they made
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
this determination despite an extensive
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
pep report from the Elliot emergency
 
05:11:52.990 --> 05:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
room years of evaluations IEPs from

various educational and medical
 
05:11:56.548 --> 05:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
professionals comments by his PC and
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
numerous reports from from A's parents
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
we asked Community Bridges to connect us
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
with a risk assessment
 
05:12:04.110 --> 05:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
we have been waiting for many months for
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
the documentation that the community of
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
practice committee had asked for we are
 
05:12:08.830 --> 05:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
still not being provided a risk
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
assessment despite the state providing
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
no dissenting views reports or
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
evaluations to counter the paperwork
 
05:12:18.670 --> 05:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
that the cop rejected the only subst
 
05:12:21.390 --> 05:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
substantive request was that we provide
 
05:12:22.990 --> 05:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
medical documentation showing the
 
05:12:24.670 --> 05:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
behaviors are not a response to a
 
05:12:27.230 --> 05:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
physical condition since then Kevin had
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
an anoscopy a CAT scan blood work EEG
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds and an MRI all of these came
 
05:12:35.548 --> 05:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
back normal and still there is no
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
response the state its agents and and
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
vendors we put in a pro proposal for ab
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
behavioralist consultant back in August
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
2024 we asked for four month for four
 
05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
months until a more complex service
 
05:12:50.430 --> 05:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
could be provided we never heard
 
05:12:52.990 --> 05:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
anything about this being approved in
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
October we requested a more complex
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
program was just approved for a mere 26
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
hours I'm on my last page well is it a
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
full page hold on it's three qus of a
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
page it's a year if it's a year of
 
05:13:08.190 --> 05:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
suffering I'm going to take it forcing
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
parents and caregivers to be
 
05:13:11.948 --> 05:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
self-educated doctors Educators
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
behavioralists and psychiatric treatment
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
facilities for a vulnerable person who
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
the state public and private sectors
 
05:13:21.190 --> 05:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
openly openly reject is nothing more
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
than State sanctioned neglect the state
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
has not produced any private facilities
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
that can properly treat and facilitate a
 
05:13:31.230 --> 05:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
stable environment for Kevin there is no
 
05:13:33.150 --> 05:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
state run group homes that provide
 
05:13:34.910 --> 05:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
services the state has no plans to
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
procure produce or seek to facilitate
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
the connecting of such Services they
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
simply put Kevin in a pool of people to
 
05:13:44.190 --> 05:13:44.200 align:start position:0%
linger In Perpetual condition of State
 
05:13:46.590 --> 05:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
sanction neglect while the crisis in his
 
05:13:49.110 --> 05:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
life unfolds furthermore I have been
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
told on multiple occasions that is out
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
of the scope of Area Agency to provide
 
05:13:55.948 --> 05:13:55.958 align:start position:0%
mental health and Behavioral Services
 
05:13:57.868 --> 05:13:57.878 align:start position:0%
simultaneously it has been determined
 
05:13:59.868 --> 05:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
that is within the scope and authority
 
05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
of community to practice to deny the
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
same this is a double standard like
 
05:14:07.110 --> 05:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
entrapment of vulnerable people and
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
state sanction neglect double standards
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
are not ethically tenable thank you
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
Chris dagas okay thank you for your
 
05:14:16.990 --> 05:14:17.000 align:start position:0%

there

05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%

05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
made

05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:22.030 --> 05:17:22.040 align:start position:0%

you may proceed yeah so I'm
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative Eric Gallagher
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
representing uh Marat County District 20
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
which is conquered W 6 and I'm here to
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
um produce or present um HB
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
1615 relative to the autism
 
05:17:51.390 --> 05:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
registry um so um yeah
 
05:17:54.548 --> 05:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
I so that that previous belill since I
 
05:17:57.070 --> 05:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
was here listening for it
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
um has kind of made me uh a little bit
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
worri about the um terminology I use
 
05:18:07.390 --> 05:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
here when um introducing this um but
 
05:18:09.788 --> 05:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
personally the term I prefer to use to
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
refer to myself is um that I'm a member
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the neuro Divergent Community um so I
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
I don't actually have um autism myself
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
I've tested negative for it um multiple
 
05:18:27.750 --> 05:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
times um which yeah may have you
 
05:18:29.708 --> 05:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
thinking oh well maybe he does have it
 
05:18:31.750 --> 05:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
and you know what fine I I don't care if
 
05:18:34.750 --> 05:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
you think that um just know that it's
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
not what I think I have or and it's not
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
part of my diagnosis um so but anyways
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah you've got neuro Divergence is
 
05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like a larger Spectrum than just
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
the autism spectrum so being part of
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
that Community I um often hear people
 
05:18:58.270 --> 05:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
talking about um different laws relating
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
to different conditions um within that
 
05:19:05.230 --> 05:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
spectrum and um one thing I heard about
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
recently was finding out that we have
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
have this um autism registry in the
 
05:19:15.070 --> 05:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
first place um so yeah when I heard
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
about that I was kind of shocked um to
 
05:19:24.990 --> 05:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
learn that it existed um and
 
05:19:28.990 --> 05:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah my first concern was okay we've
 
05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
got a state constitutional
 
05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
um guarantee to a right to privacy does
 
05:19:35.920 --> 05:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
um guarantee to a right to privacy does
this

05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
um does this registry comply with it um
 
05:19:46.030 --> 05:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
so I sent out a research request with OS
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
um they got in touch with the HHS DHHS
 
05:19:52.270 --> 05:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
said that yes it does comply um the ru
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
making they sent though
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
um seem to contain some information
 
05:19:59.070 --> 05:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
where I'm not
 
05:20:01.830 --> 05:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
entirely sure I'd agree that that it
 
05:20:04.510 --> 05:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
supports their claim that
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
um it it does actually protect privacy
 
05:20:11.470 --> 05:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
as well as it could um so I decid all
 
05:20:12.990 --> 05:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
right I'll I'll just look at the
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
enabling statute and see what I can
 
05:20:18.708 --> 05:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
change about it to um improve the
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
Privacy about it um so
 
05:20:25.788 --> 05:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah to kind of go through the
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
changes um so the first one um replacing
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
um epidemiologic with sociological um
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
that's because one of my co-sponsors
 
05:20:37.110 --> 05:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
when I was discussing it um represented
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
Foo um wanted to uh make it clear that
 
05:20:46.270 --> 05:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh autism is not a
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
contagious condition um you know and
 
05:20:52.230 --> 05:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiologic kind of has that
 
05:20:54.910 --> 05:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
implication that it is so we just kind
 
05:20:58.590 --> 05:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
of wanted to um make sure that people
 
05:21:02.190 --> 05:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
understand that like it's not an
 
05:21:07.830 --> 05:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
epidemic um so um yeah um and then for
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
replacing problem with phenomenon um a
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people on the Au and
 
05:21:16.030 --> 05:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
Spectrum uh would think that their
 
05:21:19.990 --> 05:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
condition is not actually a problem and
 
05:21:24.030 --> 05:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
is in fact an um Advantage for them um
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
so yeah the that wording changes just
 
05:21:27.788 --> 05:21:27.798 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:21:31.708 --> 05:21:31.718 align:start position:0%
to destigmatize it a little bit more um
 
05:21:34.750 --> 05:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
um and um yeah kind of reduce the
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
ableism here um so then the part where
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
it says the department may enter into an
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
agreement with an appropriate entity for
 
05:21:46.830 --> 05:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
the management of the registry
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
um so that that part kind of concerned
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
me that um you know because it that's
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
basically saying that it's not just the
 
05:21:59.510 --> 05:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
state that has access to this registry
 
05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
but also potentially
 
05:22:03.868 --> 05:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
um a thirdparty
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh entity that could have access to it
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
as well um I mean it does say provided
 
05:22:10.948 --> 05:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
that any records and data submitted to
 
05:22:12.350 --> 05:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
the department
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
pursuant um of this division shall be
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
the property of the department um but
 
05:22:20.390 --> 05:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
the thing I was worried about there so
 
05:22:23.788 --> 05:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
one of my kind of pet issues um is free
 
05:22:26.430 --> 05:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
and open source software um you know and
 
05:22:31.868 --> 05:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
open data formats so um you know even if
 
05:22:34.750 --> 05:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
the department owns the records and data
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
that those records and data still could
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
be useless if you don't have the proper
 
05:22:42.990 --> 05:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
software to be able to read it you know
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
imagine like imagine if the registry was
 
05:22:48.910 --> 05:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
kept in hieroglyphics and you didn't
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
have the Rosetta Stone like that so yeah
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
basically that's what um the additional
 
05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
Clause as as well as the software used
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
to store such data why I think um that
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
the department Ju Just to ensure that
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
this third-party entity can't like
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
change something about the format of it
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
to um make it unusable to the
 
05:23:17.310 --> 05:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
department um so the ne next section so
 
05:23:19.390 --> 05:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
the next part is about what's in the ACT
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
what is in the actual registry so um I
 
05:23:26.948 --> 05:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
tried to reduce the amount of personally
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
identifiable information that's in it um
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
so uh date of birth kind of had to stay
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
since um well I'll get to that in the
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
next section um gender though I didn't
 
05:23:42.510 --> 05:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
really see a reason for including and
 
05:23:45.310 --> 05:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's a additional source of personally
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
identifiable information so I thought of
 
05:23:51.510 --> 05:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
removing that um and then um it mentions
 
05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
the unique identification code um for
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
identifying the child um so looking in
 
05:24:03.868 --> 05:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
the rule making um so apparently the
 
05:24:06.430 --> 05:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
code is based on the initials of the
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
child in question um and so it currently
 
05:24:15.070 --> 05:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
says it it um shouldn't include the name
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
but to me at least initials are still
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
pretty close to the name so I think um
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
it's worth specifying the initials
 
05:24:30.868 --> 05:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
separately um yeah I um you know if the
 
05:24:33.230 --> 05:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
the department could come up with some
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
other sort of unique code that doesn't
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
involve initials you know come up with
 
05:24:39.708 --> 05:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
some sort of cryptographic hash or
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
something instead um and just wanted to
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that um none of the other
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
fields contained that um information as
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
well um so the next sentence um so one
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
thing I did while researching this was
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
to do a comparison of other states that
 
05:25:00.190 --> 05:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
have autism Registries and one thing I
 
05:25:03.310 --> 05:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
found that New Jersey had that I think
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
is actually kind of a positive aspect um
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's worth emulating um is when
 
05:25:14.670 --> 05:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
someone's entered in theirs they provide
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
resources to the person who um is and
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
the F their family um who's being
 
05:25:27.548 --> 05:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
entered onto it um so um yeah I added a
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
sentence to um provide for that
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
provision of resources as well um and
 
05:25:33.440 --> 05:25:34.670 align:start position:0%
provision of resources as well um and
then

05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so since this is where the the
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I handed around comes in um so
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
uh also upon discussing this um one bit
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
of feedback was uh why not add an opt
 
05:25:53.830 --> 05:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
out mechanism to it um and you know that
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
I thought that was a good suggestion I
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
honestly can't remember why I didn't
 
05:26:01.868 --> 05:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
include that in the first place um but
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
anyways yeah I thought that the
 
05:26:07.948 --> 05:26:07.958 align:start position:0%
um opt out form that this would be the
 
05:26:09.830 --> 05:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
proper place to put that like right
 
05:26:12.270 --> 05:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
after um with the provision of
 
05:26:15.948 --> 05:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
information Clause um so in section
 
05:26:15.958 --> 05:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
information Clause um so in section
three

05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:26:17.760 --> 05:26:19.750 align:start position:0%
three
um

05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:24.510 --> 05:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
so um I think I think uh
 
05:26:27.310 --> 05:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
drawing an explicit reference to State
 
05:26:30.910 --> 05:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution's guarantee of privacy um
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
is I mean so yeah the department already
 
05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
has to follow it but I think saying so
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
explicitly is just kind of good as a
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
reminder or a form of Defense in depth
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
um you know to just really drive them
 
05:26:48.510 --> 05:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
that this is something that we care
 
05:26:51.788 --> 05:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
about um so the addition of licens are
 
05:26:53.548 --> 05:26:53.558 align:start position:0%
certified so
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
um in the online 24 um so that is um to
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you go back to um the beginning of
 
05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
section two where it says physician
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
psychologist and any other licensed or
 
05:27:11.708 --> 05:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
CER certified healthcare provider um
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
shall um make this report so um the
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
addition of those terms is just kind of
 
05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
to bring the wording in sync and um so
 
05:27:24.070 --> 05:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's in sync in section three as it is
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
um in section two um
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
so um cuz yeah the par in section three
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
is um
 
05:27:33.360 --> 05:27:34.990 align:start position:0%
is um
basically

05:27:34.990 --> 05:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:27:35.000 --> 05:27:36.708 align:start position:0%
basically
a

05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
um basically a grant of um immunity or
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
divulging confidential information um
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
which I mean I can kind of see why
 
05:27:51.868 --> 05:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
that's necessary for it to be provided
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the first place under section two um
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
but um since the wording is different um
 
05:28:03.150 --> 05:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
or under current statute um what I worry
 
05:28:06.990 --> 05:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
could happen there is um you know it
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
could allow say an unlicensed or
 
05:28:13.510 --> 05:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
uncertified provider to violate
 
05:28:15.788 --> 05:28:15.798 align:start position:0%
someone's privacy even though they
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
technically don't have to under um
 
05:28:21.990 --> 05:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
section two so this is just kind of to
 
05:28:23.868 --> 05:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
tighten up that language
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
there um so the and then the addition of
 
05:28:31.670 --> 05:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
section five whenever a child reaches 18
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
years of age the department shall remove
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
the entry pertaining to the child from
 
05:28:35.480 --> 05:28:36.190 align:start position:0%
the entry pertaining to the child from
the

05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
registry um so yeah again that comes
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
from the comparison with the other
 
05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
states Registries um they the other
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
states that do have Registries do mostly
 
05:28:50.830 --> 05:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
have age out mechanisms and um yeah it
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that our current registry
 
05:28:57.590 --> 05:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
has such a magnetism and um yeah if you
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
just look through the language of the ex
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
in statute it is constantly referring to
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
the child as the one being entered into
 
05:29:09.070 --> 05:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
it so I think that kind of
 
05:29:12.750 --> 05:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that the um original intent
 
05:29:17.470 --> 05:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill um was specifically for
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
children and not for
 
05:29:24.150 --> 05:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
adults um so yeah I think that changing
 
05:29:27.150 --> 05:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
this should help bring that more in line
 
05:29:27.160 --> 05:29:29.310 align:start position:0%
this should help bring that more in line
um

05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:31.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:29:31.310 --> 05:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's basically um what the
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill does um to address some questions I
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
received about it one of the most common
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
is oh well why not just abolish the
 
05:29:44.040 --> 05:29:45.470 align:start position:0%
is oh well why not just abolish the
registry

05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
entirely um and I
 
05:29:50.548 --> 05:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
mean that's something I'd be open to if
 
05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's the direction that members of the
 
05:29:57.150 --> 05:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
community want to go in
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
um I was just feeling a little bit more
 
05:30:03.670 --> 05:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
cautious about it and think May okay
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe there is actually a
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason for having this um
 
05:30:12.548 --> 05:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
and yeah um maybe somebody will testify
 
05:30:15.868 --> 05:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
to that I'm not sure um but
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah so what one of my
 
05:30:22.390 --> 05:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that um as to why not just
 
05:30:24.110 --> 05:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
abolish it completely is the part about
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
the third party entity that could
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
potentially um be administrating
 
05:30:33.868 --> 05:30:33.878 align:start position:0%
this registry I'm worried that if we
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
abolish it improperly we might
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
accidentally end up just abolishing the
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
state's copy without also abolishing um
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
any copy that the third party entity
 
05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
might have so um yeah I just want to
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have it fully under
 
05:30:52.718 --> 05:30:53.708 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have it fully under
State

05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
State
 
05:30:57.868 --> 05:30:57.878 align:start position:0%
control um before abolishing it so yeah
 
05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:03.200 --> 05:31:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:31:06.350 --> 05:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.190 --> 05:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's what I've um got for now
 
05:31:13.628 --> 05:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
and I'll take questions any questions
 
05:31:13.638 --> 05:31:15.070 align:start position:0%
and I'll take questions any questions
representative

05:31:15.070 --> 05:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
Weber my question is actually for the
 
05:31:21.310 --> 05:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
chair um and we've been piling a lot of
 
05:31:24.270 --> 05:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
work on Christina Dyer lately but I
 
05:31:27.030 --> 05:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
would be very she's still smiling back
 
05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
there I would be very interested in a
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
history of this legislation because it
 
05:31:36.310 --> 05:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
actually the registry came in in 2006
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
which was the year that I was elected so
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
I have no personal history of why we
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
have it or what we were trying to
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish at the time and I think that
 
05:31:48.110 --> 05:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
having the background would be very
 
05:31:52.670 --> 05:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
helpful for us or for me personally uh
 
05:31:54.910 --> 05:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
to understand just gave me a thumbs up
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
right whether the whether the registry
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
is accomplishing what we wanted it to do
 
05:32:02.070 --> 05:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and why we might want to keep it or
 
05:32:05.030 --> 05:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
not keep it yeah and I I agree that is
 
05:32:06.788 --> 05:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
something that I wasn't really able to
 
05:32:10.270 --> 05:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
find out much about myself so um yeah
 
05:32:11.390 --> 05:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative Seth K thank you Mr
 
05:32:16.430 --> 05:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative to
 
05:32:19.548 --> 05:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh bring this bill before us I concur
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying I there should
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism to withdraw any
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
information out of a registry um if the
 
05:32:30.430 --> 05:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
parent or if the child upon reaching the
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
age of 18 so desires to do that so I'm
 
05:32:36.030 --> 05:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
fully in support of that but I also
 
05:32:37.708 --> 05:32:37.718 align:start position:0%
concur with representative Weber is
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the history of this
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
and fundamentally more important than
 
05:32:41.120 --> 05:32:41.868 align:start position:0%
and fundamentally more important than
the

05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
history is the registry being utilized
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
and if it is is it effective is it
 
05:32:47.548 --> 05:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
accomplishing what it wanted to
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish um so this is something when
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
with talking with one of my co-sponsors
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
that apparently I'm representative Theo
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
looked into a little bit um apparently
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
the the point is um for doing um
 
05:33:08.830 --> 05:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
scientific studies with um I mean and I
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
I think that's kind of they kind of
 
05:33:12.910 --> 05:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
touch on that
 
05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
um in section or Roman one um with
 
05:33:21.430 --> 05:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
enabling Al analysis and facilitating
 
05:33:22.590 --> 05:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
planning and
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
services um but uh yeah
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard is that that hasn't
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
actually been happening is that
 
05:33:36.830 --> 05:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
um there apparently there's only been
 
05:33:39.868 --> 05:33:39.878 align:start position:0%
one um peer-reviewed
 
05:33:44.590 --> 05:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
study um that has been used the autism
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
Registries data since it was first
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
introduced um which yeah that
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
seems like a fairly small number and
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
like it's not
 
05:34:01.070 --> 05:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
really living up to its purpose to me
 
05:34:02.830 --> 05:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
Al set representative
 
05:34:05.590 --> 05:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant representative Seth King thank
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
questions I have um I don't have a
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
device in front of me to look up
 
05:34:16.948 --> 05:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
definitions um anytime I have a question
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
about definitions I love to look things
 
05:34:21.030 --> 05:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
up just to really make things concrete
 
05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
so maybe somebody else can do this and
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
later explain to me but you want to
 
05:34:27.628 --> 05:34:27.638 align:start position:0%
scratch out the word epidemiologic and
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
replace it with sociological and the
 
05:34:32.350 --> 05:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
reasoning you gave was that you know uh
 
05:34:35.788 --> 05:34:35.798 align:start position:0%
autism isn't contagious but I know that
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
we often use the word epidemic for
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
things like obesity loneliness epidemic
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
um and those aren't contagious so um I'm
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
just wondering if either I or you are
 
05:34:51.190 --> 05:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
mistaken by what epidemiologic means and
 
05:34:53.590 --> 05:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
then furthermore um you replace it with
 
05:34:57.948 --> 05:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
a word sociological which to me sort of
 
05:35:01.390 --> 05:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
implies cultural not not terribly that's
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the best word but um it sort
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
of almost sounds like it's a choice more
 
05:35:09.310 --> 05:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
than something that you don't have a
 
05:35:11.470 --> 05:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
choice and if you use the word
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
sociological um I could be wrong about
 
05:35:15.510 --> 05:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm just throwing that out there um
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that um so
 
05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there is um a difference
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
between referring to things as an
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
epidemic and the use of the term
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
epidemia ological um you know I think
 
05:35:35.708 --> 05:35:35.718 align:start position:0%
when you add theology suffix on there
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
and um you know talking about in a
 
05:35:39.360 --> 05:35:40.868 align:start position:0%
and um you know talking about in a
scientific

05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
05:35:44.788 --> 05:35:44.798 align:start position:0%
context um that is different from
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
without that suffix when um yeah with
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
without that suffix it's a lot um people
 
05:35:54.750 --> 05:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
are generally a lot Freer to use it as a
 
05:35:57.548 --> 05:35:57.558 align:start position:0%
metaphor or as figurative language or
 
05:36:01.830 --> 05:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
something but um adding theology kind of
 
05:36:07.548 --> 05:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
makes it not quite so much um so um yeah
 
05:36:11.310 --> 05:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
my intention with um
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
sociological um replacing with
 
05:36:17.708 --> 05:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
sociological wasn't to imply that autism
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
is a choice or anything like that um but
 
05:36:23.788 --> 05:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
just kind of
 
05:36:27.868 --> 05:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
to try to come up with a different
 
05:36:30.510 --> 05:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
adjective that's a little bit more
 
05:36:35.948 --> 05:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
humanizing for um the people
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
experiencing um these conditions um you
 
05:36:40.558 --> 05:36:42.030 align:start position:0%
experiencing um these conditions um you
know

05:36:42.030 --> 05:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
um if if you have an alternative
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
adjective um that is better than both
 
05:36:54.990 --> 05:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
epidemiologic and sociological I would
 
05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
be um open to um
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
replacing it with that third adjective
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
instead but um that
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
is um just the first the first one that
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
came to mind for
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
me other questions oh followup it's not
 
05:37:16.110 --> 05:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
a follow-up but I do have another
 
05:37:16.120 --> 05:37:17.750 align:start position:0%
a follow-up but I do have another
question

05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you have this part here as well as
 
05:37:22.910 --> 05:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
the software used to store store such
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
data now being a free software Advocate
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
myself I know what that means and I know
 
05:37:30.910 --> 05:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
you know what that means I'm not sure if
 
05:37:32.830 --> 05:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
the lawyers would really know what that
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
means um because it's it's not terribly
 
05:37:39.270 --> 05:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
explicit saying free software which you
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
own and you control and you could edit
 
05:37:42.788 --> 05:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
the source code and all those things um
 
05:37:46.510 --> 05:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm and my question is
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
um so for example Excel is a Microsoft
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
program I believe and that's a
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and and free software
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
Advocates would use like open I can't
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
remember what the name of it is open
 
05:38:02.110 --> 05:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
office or office open Office which is
 
05:38:04.350 --> 05:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
basically Excel but it's free software
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if they had this registry um my
 
05:38:10.670 --> 05:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
question is they' probably be required
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
to use something like open office
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:38:16.270 --> 05:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
excel but seeing is how it's they're
 
05:38:18.628 --> 05:38:18.638 align:start position:0%
going to be on computers that are apple
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
or Microsoft computers they're not going
 
05:38:23.150 --> 05:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
to be Linux computers would this get
 
05:38:26.270 --> 05:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
them in trouble because while open
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
Office might be free free and open
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
source software the computer uh the uh
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
operating system itself would not be and
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
then then it would really get him into
 
05:38:37.868 --> 05:38:37.878 align:start position:0%
trouble what are your thoughts so so my
 
05:38:40.830 --> 05:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
intent here wasn't to
 
05:38:44.830 --> 05:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
um wasn't necessarily to try to free the
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
entire software stack all at once um I
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
mean that is something that I've tried
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
with other legislation but hasn't gone
 
05:38:55.230 --> 05:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
over too well um with the state it
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
department so um yeah my intent here was
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
kind of to kind of keep this limited or
 
05:39:08.910 --> 05:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
in the yeah most narrow fashion to um
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
just the software the program um
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
individual programs such as um yeah such
 
05:39:18.468 --> 05:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
as open office or Libra office or
 
05:39:22.190 --> 05:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
whatever and I'd also not note that um R
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
RSA um chapter
 
05:39:28.990 --> 05:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
21r uh has some uh definitions of open
 
05:39:33.708 --> 05:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
data formats so um and o Open Source
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
software so um I think uh if you need
 
05:39:40.990 --> 05:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
some more Precision you could um just
 
05:39:46.070 --> 05:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
draw a CR cross reference to um RSA 21
 
05:39:50.270 --> 05:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
r10 um to uh make yeah make that a
 
05:39:53.030 --> 05:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:39:58.920 --> 05:40:06.830 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
also sign up to speak is representative
 
05:40:08.760 --> 05:40:16.868 align:start position:0%
also sign up to speak is representative

kutab thank you Mr chairman and

honorable members of the house and uh
 
05:40:24.708 --> 05:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee for
 
05:40:26.708 --> 05:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Caitlyn cab representing
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
17 I am a co-sponsor on this bill
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
however I would like to state
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
that I have gotten so many phone calls
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
from parents on both sides of the aisle
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
that really would like to ultimately see
 
05:40:45.150 --> 05:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
the entire registry just repealed they
 
05:40:47.070 --> 05:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
have not gotten any value out of it and
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
many were really angry when they saw the
 
05:40:51.150 --> 05:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
bill because they had no idea that their
 
05:40:54.468 --> 05:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
child's data had ever been shared let
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
alone had they ever consented for it to
 
05:40:59.990 --> 05:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
be shared and while it is said that
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're hippoc compliant and whatnot I
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
would like to state that part of the
 
05:41:05.310 --> 05:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
things that go into this registry
 
05:41:07.750 --> 05:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
include the last four digits of the
 
05:41:10.430 --> 05:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
patient social security number as well
 
05:41:12.548 --> 05:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
as the patient's initials date of birth
 
05:41:14.110 --> 05:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
their Residence at Birth and their
 
05:41:16.030 --> 05:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
Residence at the time of diagnosis and
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
their gender depending on which small
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
town you're in I know in wiam we have a
 
05:41:24.030 --> 05:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
list of all the children who were born
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the year we get a yearly Town
 
05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
report if you go through we're a small
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
enough town and we're not really that
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
small um you could figure out looking at
 
05:41:35.390 --> 05:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's initials who this kid
 
05:41:36.910 --> 05:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
potentially could be by knowing their
 
05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
year of birth from this report and then
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
the year on this
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
so this was this legislation was enacted
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
in 2006 we were the second state to put
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
in an Autism registry West Virginia was
 
05:41:50.830 --> 05:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
the first there are currently eight
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
states which which have an Autism
 
05:41:56.190 --> 05:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
registry in it um it was enacted
 
05:41:59.788 --> 05:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
to analyze the
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
autism issue that was happening or
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
diagnosis to see if there was more
 
05:42:06.868 --> 05:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
diagnosises what could be done and also
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
to facilitate the the planning and care
 
05:42:13.350 --> 05:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
for those with autism however when you
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
go and ask is anything being done with
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
this data what positively are we doing
 
05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
data there's not one example we give out
 
05:42:24.750 --> 05:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
a yearly report which you can find on
 
05:42:28.510 --> 05:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
the HHS HHS website which just simply
 
05:42:31.310 --> 05:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
States the number that were diagnosed
 
05:42:34.230 --> 05:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
and the age that they were diagnosed at
 
05:42:38.110 --> 05:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
and also their ethnicity and it gives it
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
it also gives a report by County so I
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
guess just aggregating and telling
 
05:42:46.270 --> 05:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
people how many were diagnosed with a
 
05:42:48.628 --> 05:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
particular disorder I'm not sure what
 
05:42:50.190 --> 05:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
value that that's adding it's not
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
providing any of the other value that it
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
was initially stated could potentially
 
05:42:54.000 --> 05:42:55.390 align:start position:0%
was initially stated could potentially
add

05:42:55.390 --> 05:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
add
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I do like the fact that now we're
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
talking about potentially you know
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
asking parents for their permission at
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
least to to to pass on this data I guess
 
05:43:06.310 --> 05:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure what the purpose of
 
05:43:07.708 --> 05:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
continuing on with something that isn't
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
currently being used for
 
05:43:14.430 --> 05:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
any beneficial purpose is so my
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
um opinion would be it would be better
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
if this was amended to just repeal the
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
registry entirely I'm happy to take any
 
05:43:25.390 --> 05:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
 
05:43:27.868 --> 05:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thank you Mr chairman
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question question I
 
05:43:33.070 --> 05:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
I'm always interested in hearing about
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
these Registries that I never knew
 
05:43:37.468 --> 05:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
existed you know and we had the ALS one
 
05:43:39.548 --> 05:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
last year I diagnosed ALS I've never
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
even knew the registry existed so I'm
 
05:43:42.670 --> 05:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
curious how many people aren't even
 
05:43:45.390 --> 05:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
being reported at all the other concern
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I had about this process too is
 
05:43:50.190 --> 05:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
having a child who does not have autism
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
who is diagnosed with autism merely so
 
05:43:55.350 --> 05:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
we could qualify for services I'm
 
05:43:57.150 --> 05:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
curious how much of this information
 
05:43:59.670 --> 05:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
that goes into this registry is even
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
accurate um and I'm just curious if you
 
05:44:03.468 --> 05:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts if that changes your
 
05:44:06.070 --> 05:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
mind stimulates you to agree with what
 
05:44:08.430 --> 05:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
your position you just took was
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
or I think I just made a statement more
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
than yeah so I'm not sure how accurate
 
05:44:14.830 --> 05:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
it is either there was many of the
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
parents when they were upset that they
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
found out about this they were like well
 
05:44:19.628 --> 05:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
what if we our child was diagnosed in
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is it going to go in there
 
05:44:22.868 --> 05:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
technically the rule says that if you
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
were if you were diagnosed in
 
05:44:26.190 --> 05:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts when you would go back to
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
your pediatrician here in New Hampshire
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
your pediatrician should should be
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
putting it in there how often that
 
05:44:34.030 --> 05:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing it who knows if
 
05:44:36.190 --> 05:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
somebody is later found out that this
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
was a misdiagnosis are they removing it
 
05:44:40.708 --> 05:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
who knows is there there's I couldn't
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
find a report on here to remove somebody
 
05:44:44.910 --> 05:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
I could find the the part where you
 
05:44:46.430 --> 05:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
input somebody but there was nothing on
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
the website to remove somebody if say
 
05:44:52.110 --> 05:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
you put in a person that was later found
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
out to not have it so I would share the
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
same concerns as you that I'm not sure
 
05:45:00.150 --> 05:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
that it's even that accurate
 
05:45:02.030 --> 05:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
other questions representative South
 
05:45:03.628 --> 05:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
taking questions it sounds like there
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
are some negative consequences of having
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
been put on this registry can you
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
explain that a little bit more in detail
 
05:45:15.628 --> 05:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if somebody could be I
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
don't know denied access to some rights
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are you know standard for everybody
 
05:45:24.270 --> 05:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
else because they're on this list um can
 
05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
you go into that at all
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
thanks so I'm not sure that I'm aware of
 
05:45:31.310 --> 05:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
most of the people that I talk with
 
05:45:33.150 --> 05:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
weren't even aware that their child was
 
05:45:34.990 --> 05:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
on such a list so I have not been made
 
05:45:37.390 --> 05:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
aware of anybody that was discriminated
 
05:45:39.310 --> 05:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
against as a result of being on this
 
05:45:39.320 --> 05:45:40.910 align:start position:0%
against as a result of being on this
list

05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
list
 
05:45:43.350 --> 05:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
however I think that there is an issue
 
05:45:45.070 --> 05:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
of of a privacy concern here and you
 
05:45:46.430 --> 05:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what what somebody's going to
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
do with this data I mean we have data
 
05:45:50.310 --> 05:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
breaches with different things all the
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
time so could there potentially be at
 
05:45:53.548 --> 05:45:53.558 align:start position:0%
some point absolutely especially when
 
05:45:54.670 --> 05:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
you consider that you're putting the
 
05:45:56.270 --> 05:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
last four digits of somebody's social
 
05:45:58.030 --> 05:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
security number and their date of birth
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
I think it makes it pretty
 
05:46:02.990 --> 05:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
easy if the right person stole that data
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to find the person
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
and do whatever they want with
 
05:46:09.390 --> 05:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
it other
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:46:14.878 --> 05:46:16.390 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you for taking my question
um

05:46:16.390 --> 05:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:20.350 --> 05:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
online um six and seven uh part of the
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
purpose is to facilitate planning for
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
services to Children uh and their
 
05:46:27.548 --> 05:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
families and so are you familiar or can
 
05:46:29.548 --> 05:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
you describe what kinds of Serv Services
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
children and their families
 
05:46:34.590 --> 05:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
receive sure thank you for the question
 
05:46:37.868 --> 05:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
so I did ask the question in terms of
 
05:46:40.670 --> 05:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
what is being done for this planning how
 
05:46:42.468 --> 05:46:42.478 align:start position:0%
is this being used and what I was told
 
05:46:45.070 --> 05:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
was in the beginning they were trying to
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
impress upon the fact that early
 
05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and early intervention led
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
to much higher success um however that's
 
05:46:57.390 --> 05:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
already been implemented it's already
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
part of regular Pediatric
 
05:46:59.320 --> 05:47:00.948 align:start position:0%
part of regular Pediatric
screenings

05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
screenings
 
05:47:04.390 --> 05:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
so in terms of planning for facilitating
 
05:47:06.910 --> 05:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
things this information like the the
 
05:47:08.750 --> 05:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
parents address and stuff is not in the
 
05:47:11.150 --> 05:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
database so you don't have HHS coming
 
05:47:12.430 --> 05:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
forward and sending the parents
 
05:47:14.590 --> 05:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
information and saying hey here here's
 
05:47:16.590 --> 05:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
these resources that are available just
 
05:47:19.150 --> 05:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
so you know like you can go and see if
 
05:47:20.990 --> 05:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
if the child's you know under three if
 
05:47:22.750 --> 05:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for early intervention
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
if they're over three that they may be
 
05:47:27.150 --> 05:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for an IEP at school that's not
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
happening so it doesn't seem like
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
any of this actual planning I'm not even
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
sure how it even could happen since it's
 
05:47:37.230 --> 05:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
deidentified supposed to be deidentified
 
05:47:37.240 --> 05:47:38.990 align:start position:0%
deidentified supposed to be deidentified
data

05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:47:41.390 --> 05:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
followup so who do you know who that's
 
05:47:43.310 --> 05:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
going that information is going to
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
because I would assume and I could be
 
05:47:46.390 --> 05:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
completely wrong that it is family
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
centered early supports and services the
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
people who you know uh administer the
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
programming or is it somewhere else like
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's on the web for
 
05:47:59.150 --> 05:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
anybody to access it
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
a specific place that collects the data
 
05:48:04.110 --> 05:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes so that children
 
05:48:05.708 --> 05:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
and families can be
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
served so since you've looked into it I
 
05:48:09.628 --> 05:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
was hoping you could share yeah so there
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
um hold on one second I'm trying to see
 
05:48:21.430 --> 05:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
if I can find it
 
05:48:21.440 --> 05:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
if I can find it
uh

05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
sure do we have a card from the
 
05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
Department we do uh uh attorney Williams
 
05:48:32.270 --> 05:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps that would be the best coming up
 
05:48:35.390 --> 05:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
next it does say it's yeah it is shared
 
05:48:37.390 --> 05:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Ed office the New
 
05:48:39.390 --> 05:48:39.400 align:start position:0%

Health um and annual results are are
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
also published on the
 
05:48:54.868 --> 05:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
website um so those bureaus are getting
 
05:48:56.708 --> 05:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not sure how that's helping
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
to provide services to kids since these
 
05:49:01.788 --> 05:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
services are often provided by area
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.390 --> 05:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
DSM diagnoses are not static they're
 
05:49:17.990 --> 05:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
changing all the time and they come out
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
with new additions of the um
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
DSM frequently so um what was considered
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
an a diagnosis of autism
 
05:49:31.350 --> 05:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
30 years ago is not what's considered
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of autism spectrum
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
disorder currently so I'm wondering if
 
05:49:41.310 --> 05:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know in the autism spectrum in the
 
05:49:46.590 --> 05:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
autism um registry how the changing
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
criteria for diagnosis is taken into
 
05:49:53.788 --> 05:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:55.830 --> 05:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
report thank you for the question so I'm
 
05:49:57.468 --> 05:49:57.478 align:start position:0%
not sure how you're supposed to report a
 
05:49:59.788 --> 05:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
change but currently there
 
05:50:02.830 --> 05:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
are five different categories under the
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
the ICD code for it so there's childhood
 
05:50:09.468 --> 05:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
autism atypical autism Asbergers PPD
 
05:50:13.510 --> 05:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
unspecified and other PDD so I'm not
 
05:50:15.868 --> 05:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
sure how you I don't I could not find a
 
05:50:19.548 --> 05:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
mechanism on the website to either amend
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
data or remove data as I as I mentioned
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you later find out that somebody
 
05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually have autism I couldn't
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
find a way to remove that data and
 
05:50:30.910 --> 05:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
possibly it exists but it wasn't easily
 
05:50:34.350 --> 05:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
found on the website follow up follow
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
up I think you did answer my question
 
05:50:38.948 --> 05:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
that that at any given time like
 
05:50:42.468 --> 05:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
currently there are specific categories
 
05:50:45.750 --> 05:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
that are um reportable to the registry
 
05:50:48.990 --> 05:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you representative
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
kofel thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um on the
 
05:50:59.070 --> 05:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
FAQ web on the on the website there is
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
an FAQ this is the DHHS website about
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
the autism uh Spectrum
 
05:51:09.548 --> 05:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
registry um there is a question what is
 
05:51:12.510 --> 05:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose the the now I apologize I
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
left the the page have to come back but
 
05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
essentially it says that the the there
 
05:51:18.990 --> 05:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
are several reasons to have this but
 
05:51:22.670 --> 05:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
that the primary reason is to improve uh
 
05:51:24.190 --> 05:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that we're we're
 
05:51:26.468 --> 05:51:26.478 align:start position:0%
screening and diagnosing
 
05:51:29.270 --> 05:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
autism um th thoroughly and accurately
 
05:51:31.868 --> 05:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um this was passed
 
05:51:36.350 --> 05:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
in 2006 in your opinion has uh this
 
05:51:38.430 --> 05:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
screening and diagnosis of autism
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
improved or or become more standard as
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
part of the Pediatric Care process since
 
05:51:49.150 --> 05:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
2006 thank you for the question so I
 
05:51:51.350 --> 05:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
would say that definitely the screenings
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
that are going on in the Pediatric
 
05:51:52.840 --> 05:51:55.590 align:start position:0%
that are going on in the Pediatric
offices

05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
have increased what the number of
 
05:52:00.270 --> 05:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
questioners that they're asking at the
 
05:52:01.750 --> 05:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
different developmental stages to try
 
05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
and screen for things like this so I
 
05:52:07.830 --> 05:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
would say that it has has much improved
 
05:52:10.030 --> 05:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
yes but I'm not sure that that's a
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
result of this registry because that's
 
05:52:13.110 --> 05:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
something that's more standardized
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
through the American Academy of
 
05:52:18.670 --> 05:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics other
 
05:52:25.510 --> 05:52:25.520 align:start position:0%

05:52:41.948 --> 05:52:41.958 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon members of the
 
05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services LLY Affairs
 
05:52:44.990 --> 05:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I am John
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
Williams I am the director of
 
05:52:49.270 --> 05:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs and with me is uh
 
05:52:51.468 --> 05:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Melissa nth
 
05:52:54.670 --> 05:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
also from the Department of Health and
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services and what I'd like to do
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
is take um a three prong approach one to
 
05:53:01.430 --> 05:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
explain the bill on its face uh to give
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
you some information uh around the bill
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
number two would be some thoughts and
 
05:53:06.548 --> 05:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
Impressions about the discussions that
 
05:53:08.190 --> 05:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
have happened and options for this
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee to take and number three just
 
05:53:12.190 --> 05:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing in the audience the prime
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor for the underlying bill that
 
05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
created the registry uh former
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative John jooy is actually in
 
05:53:20.110 --> 05:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
the room and submitted a pin card and
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to provide you with some
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure robust history going back to
 
05:53:26.190 --> 05:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
2006 and the development as to where we
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
are currently um the department did
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
submit its fiscal analysis to the
 
05:53:32.708 --> 05:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
legislative budget Assistance Office on
 
05:53:34.468 --> 05:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
January 4th it was just right after the
 
05:53:35.830 --> 05:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
New Year's and you folks were getting
 
05:53:38.830 --> 05:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
ready for a wonderful session uh and
 
05:53:40.270 --> 05:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
because they're just so overwhelmed with
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of work they weren't able to
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
turn around the fiscal analysis for your
 
05:53:46.110 --> 05:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
consideration I would represent to you
 
05:53:47.868 --> 05:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
that the bill under the four corners of
 
05:53:49.830 --> 05:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
the document would not represent at
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
least to the department any change we
 
05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
would certainly be able to make these
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
changes We Believe with current and
 
05:53:56.468 --> 05:53:56.478 align:start position:0%
existing resources however there could
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
be an impact to the provider Community
 
05:53:59.910 --> 05:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
because currently there's an additional
 
05:54:01.590 --> 05:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that they otherwise wouldn't
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
have from a technical standpoint and
 
05:54:05.070 --> 05:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm just working off the bill in
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
case you do decide to move forward with
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
the bill as it was presented to and as
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
introduced uh one of the concerns that
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
was raised in the uh fiscal analysis
 
05:54:15.468 --> 05:54:15.478 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to bring to your
 
05:54:16.868 --> 05:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
attention and also the sponsor and
 
05:54:19.990 --> 05:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor attention is on line nine and
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
10 of the bill when it discusses about
 
05:54:23.830 --> 05:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
the property of the department to
 
05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
include also not only the data which is
 
05:54:28.670 --> 05:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
under current law but also as to the
 
05:54:31.868 --> 05:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
software used to store such data um if
 
05:54:34.468 --> 05:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
we were to contract out on that piece we
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
would probably find it very difficult
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
that a vendor would want to assign that
 
05:54:40.190 --> 05:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
property interest to the department and
 
05:54:41.628 --> 05:54:41.638 align:start position:0%
I would represent to you right now that
 
05:54:43.230 --> 05:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
we're currently not working with a third
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
party which was a very good question
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
raised by by the committee so that would
 
05:54:49.110 --> 05:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
be a concern with that section in terms
 
05:54:51.468 --> 05:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
of hampering our ability if we were to
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
contract out currently this is all being
 
05:54:55.868 --> 05:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
done inh house within the department and
 
05:54:58.670 --> 05:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
utilizing primarily the Exel uh does go
 
05:55:01.628 --> 05:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
back to 2006 so we utilize those tools
 
05:55:03.708 --> 05:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
that are out there and currently utilize
 
05:55:05.590 --> 05:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
that same but I'm sure like everything
 
05:55:07.628 --> 05:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
evolving that will do exactly what I
 
05:55:09.788 --> 05:55:09.798 align:start position:0%
think that represent Seth King was uh
 
05:55:12.788 --> 05:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
was referring to um the other item is on
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
line 23 uh under the um paragraph uh
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
three of the current law there's a
 
05:55:20.628 --> 05:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
provision that adds in accordance with
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state constitution
 
05:55:24.910 --> 05:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee of privacy we we do not take
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
exception to that but we would like add
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
it if it the bill is to go forward for
 
05:55:30.990 --> 05:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
to include or any other provisions of
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
law because that's really important to
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
include that as well if you're going to
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
qualify specifically where the source
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
for protecting the confidentiality of
 
05:55:41.830 --> 05:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
the information um comes from um this
 
05:55:44.110 --> 05:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
may surprise you um we actually came to
 
05:55:46.548 --> 05:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
a very similar conclusion as the sponsor
 
05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsor about the viability and
 
05:55:52.350 --> 05:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
the need for the registry it is very
 
05:55:54.510 --> 05:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
very important that we care uh very much
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
about all of New Hampshire's population
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
particularly those who have been d
 
05:56:00.830 --> 05:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with autism and through our uh
 
05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau of long-term supports uh and
 
05:56:04.628 --> 05:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
Bureau developmental Services we do
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
contract with area agencies to provide
 
05:56:08.270 --> 05:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
those services and under the definitions
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
to qualify for those services for uh
 
05:56:13.708 --> 05:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
disa uh Disability Services autism is
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
one of those areas so we actually
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
believe constructively that much of what
 
05:56:20.110 --> 05:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was trying to much of what
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
registry rather is trying to accomplish
 
05:56:23.350 --> 05:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
is actually happening in real-time
 
05:56:24.788 --> 05:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
practice in terms of identifying
 
05:56:26.750 --> 05:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
children who have been diagnosed with
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
autism and providing them with those all
 
05:56:30.468 --> 05:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
important services for developmental
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
Services the other thing is the question
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
is start wrapping up yes I will wrap up
 
05:56:39.788 --> 05:56:39.798 align:start position:0%
importantly um so the department of Ed
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
maintains statistical data on autism we
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
need to and I would suggest that uh
 
05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
through working with your committee
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
researcher working with the Department
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
of Ed to explore what they're currently
 
05:56:52.030 --> 05:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
already reporting so if you go to the
 
05:56:54.510 --> 05:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
Department of education's website under
 
05:56:56.910 --> 05:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
special education they provide data as
 
05:56:58.350 --> 05:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
it relates to ODS
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
it likely is either coming from the
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
individual education plans the IEPs or
 
05:57:04.590 --> 05:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
from data that's coming from the school
 
05:57:06.030 --> 05:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
sources so you are getting that all
 
05:57:07.948 --> 05:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
important data perhaps from another
 
05:57:10.030 --> 05:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
location so that raises a question about
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
duplication of efforts and thank you for
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence because I really think
 
05:57:14.468 --> 05:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
this is an important point for you to
 
05:57:16.628 --> 05:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
make some progress on this legislation
 
05:57:19.548 --> 05:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
is that it is probably likely that this
 
05:57:22.190 --> 05:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
is actually outl its usefulness uh for a
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
very different reason than perhaps uh
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
because we do Safeguard information we
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly about that but um it
 
05:57:29.948 --> 05:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't serve you well to having two
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
sources of uh data and information on
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
the same subject matter and we would
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
agree to explore the issue of either
 
05:57:39.310 --> 05:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
repealing or abolishing this might make
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
some sense so whether you put this bill
 
05:57:42.788 --> 05:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
into interm study or allow a couple of
 
05:57:44.468 --> 05:57:44.478 align:start position:0%
weeks to hold on this before exing out
 
05:57:46.190 --> 05:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
for perhaps an amendment so that you can
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
further explore what the department of
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
Ed does provide for data around autism
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
because we certainly support the
 
05:57:53.548 --> 05:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
services through those diagnosis so at
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
least we're accomplishing that all
 
05:57:56.830 --> 05:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
important end of it so at the end of the
 
05:57:58.230 --> 05:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
day hopefully I didn't surpris you so
 
05:58:00.030 --> 05:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
much by saying we agreed for very
 
05:58:01.230 --> 05:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
different purposes I have to go on the
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
record with the sponsor and the
 
05:58:04.150 --> 05:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor for the bill and wanted to
 
05:58:05.990 --> 05:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank them for bringing these issues
 
05:58:07.230 --> 05:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
before this
 
05:58:10.350 --> 05:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Seth King a
 
05:58:13.270 --> 05:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
procedural question for the chair um if
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
we were to um put an amendment to scrap
 
05:58:18.590 --> 05:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
the registry Al together would that be
 
05:58:20.590 --> 05:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
considered germine and would we be able
 
05:58:22.910 --> 05:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
to do that um without another public
 
05:58:24.190 --> 05:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
hearing or would there need to be
 
05:58:25.708 --> 05:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
another public hearing with the Germain
 
05:58:26.830 --> 05:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment you don't need a public
 
05:58:28.830 --> 05:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
hearing you don't need hear um and to
 
05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on that question would it be
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
fair to uh put forward an amendment like
 
05:58:34.990 --> 05:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
that and then not allow anybody from the
 
05:58:36.590 --> 05:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
the community come and speak on it
 
05:58:38.628 --> 05:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
because right now we got a public
 
05:58:42.070 --> 05:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
hearing um that's fairly benign but if
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
we were to put something forth like
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
scrapping it um nobody from the public
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to come and defend the
 
05:58:49.350 --> 05:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
program so to speak so I'm just curious
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts and I would like to
 
05:58:53.230 --> 05:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
know what representative Weber's
 
05:58:56.430 --> 05:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that would be um as well
 
05:58:58.230 --> 05:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:59:01.468 --> 05:59:01.478 align:start position:0%
having seen any number of times when um
 
05:59:03.270 --> 05:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
a committee has taken a bill on a
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
particular subject and changed it to
 
05:59:09.468 --> 05:59:09.478 align:start position:0%
exactly 180 degrees opposite of what the
 
05:59:12.110 --> 05:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh Prime sponsor intended I would agree
 
05:59:15.468 --> 05:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
that it's a Germain issue and I will
 
05:59:18.548 --> 05:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
remind people that at a minimum if
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's the route that the committee
 
05:59:23.430 --> 05:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
decided to take there is a whole new set
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
of hearings in the body which must not
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
be named
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
so people who suddenly said you did what
 
05:59:37.030 --> 05:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
would have a significant and and real
 
05:59:40.350 --> 05:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go and say this is why
 
05:59:42.670 --> 05:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't and the other body would
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
be telling us about that so I would be
 
05:59:49.310 --> 05:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable without a uh another public
 
05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
hearing but it's a good point to
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
raise any other questions representative
 
05:59:57.628 --> 05:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you Mr chairman thanks sir
 
05:59:59.310 --> 05:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just have a
 
06:00:00.510 --> 06:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
question how much does it cost to
 
06:00:03.430 --> 06:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.628 --> 06:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
registry that is a question we will have
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
to take back I don't know I was not
 
06:00:10.190 --> 06:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
prepared for that question I'm sorry but
 
06:00:12.190 --> 06:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
to give you the the idea we are talking
 
06:00:13.910 --> 06:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
about getting the information from the
 
06:00:15.510 --> 06:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
various provider communities and putting
 
06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
it on an Excel spreadsheet so it's not
 
06:00:19.350 --> 06:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
an overly I mean we we meet the letter
 
06:00:21.788 --> 06:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
of the law but it's not an overly robust
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
what you would think in terms of uh
 
06:00:25.948 --> 06:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
significant cost associated with if you
 
06:00:27.910 --> 06:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
were to repeal it so there would not be
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
a very large sum of money we would love
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
to think that that we could utilize in
 
06:00:32.390 --> 06:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
other places but I don't think that
 
06:00:34.030 --> 06:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
would be the case and because it's on
 
06:00:35.948 --> 06:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
the department it's it goes on the
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
department's website it goes to the
 
06:00:39.030 --> 06:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
department maintains it all it's not
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
through any thirdparty vendor um I don't
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
know that there actually is a way to
 
06:00:44.670 --> 06:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
determine a cost we can certainly look
 
06:00:46.150 --> 06:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
into that but because it's something
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the department operates on its own
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
systems already I don't know that we
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
could identify a specific cost but what
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
I could say to to the chair is that if
 
06:00:55.990 --> 06:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
this bill were to be hypothetically
 
06:00:58.510 --> 06:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
amended to include a repeal and the full
 
06:01:00.310 --> 06:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
body did vote on that then the
 
06:01:02.030 --> 06:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
department would be required providing a
 
06:01:03.670 --> 06:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
financial analysis specifically in the
 
06:01:05.350 --> 06:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
four corners of the repeal and what
 
06:01:08.190 --> 06:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
those costs might be in terms of cost
 
06:01:10.788 --> 06:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
savings other
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:01:18.190 --> 06:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:21.548 --> 06:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Chase
 
06:01:25.390 --> 06:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair McDonald thank you for
 
06:01:39.150 --> 06:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony my name is Chase
 
06:01:41.350 --> 06:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
seagullson I am the policy and planning
 
06:01:42.430 --> 06:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the New Hampshire
 
06:01:44.430 --> 06:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
Council development disabilities we are
 
06:01:46.628 --> 06:01:46.638 align:start position:0%
a federally funded state agency mandated
 
06:01:48.910 --> 06:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
by the Americans with Disabilities Act
 
06:01:50.468 --> 06:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to start with my stance on
 
06:01:52.990 --> 06:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as is uh because that's what we
 
06:01:54.510 --> 06:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
wrote testimony for we have testimony
 
06:01:56.190 --> 06:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
going around from our director of policy
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
and planning as is we like the bill uh
 
06:02:01.628 --> 06:02:01.638 align:start position:0%
we like it better with uh representative
 
06:02:03.390 --> 06:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
Gallagher's amendment to allow parents
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
to opt out I can't as for now take a
 
06:02:08.510 --> 06:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
stance on repealing the bill because we
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into that
 
06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
enough uh but if it's defunct as uh the
 
06:02:16.230 --> 06:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
attorney said it might be then then it's
 
06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
defunct and there's no point in getting
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
two uh the same source of information
 
06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
from two different
 
06:02:23.548 --> 06:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
places U I'll try to be short and uh
 
06:02:25.310 --> 06:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
short and sweet so that's all I have for
 
06:02:29.948 --> 06:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:29.958 --> 06:02:31.548 align:start position:0%
 
any

06:02:31.548 --> 06:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:02:37.868 --> 06:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:46.750 --> 06:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
aof and you've asked for three
 
06:02:49.708 --> 06:02:49.718 align:start position:0%
minutes I will also try to be brief good
 
06:02:51.910 --> 06:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is Jessica goof and
 
06:02:53.628 --> 06:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
I'm here today speaking as a member of
 
06:02:57.948 --> 06:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
the public I also in support of hb650
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
um with the conversation of getting rid
 
06:03:02.750 --> 06:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the registry altogether I would also
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
back that um actually would back even
 
06:03:07.628 --> 06:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
more so uh this bill I think is a step
 
06:03:09.628 --> 06:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to ensure that
 
06:03:12.230 --> 06:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
folks who are diagnosed with autism do
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
have the right to privacy in the state
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
we know that historically folks with
 
06:03:18.468 --> 06:03:18.478 align:start position:0%
disabilities have been mistreated by a
 
06:03:20.830 --> 06:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
variety of governmental bodies and
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's a warranted fear in the
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
community of getting assessed I know in
 
06:03:27.270 --> 06:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
this original bill it did seem like the
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
intent was to track youth but there are
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
a number of adults I know in the
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
community who are avoiding seeking
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
diagnosis because they as an adult don't
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
want to be added to the registry um I
 
06:03:40.670 --> 06:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
will say that in New Hampshire it's my
 
06:03:42.270 --> 06:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are not any
 
06:03:45.948 --> 06:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
autism specific um resources for adults
 
06:03:49.310 --> 06:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
they are um included through the um area
 
06:03:51.430 --> 06:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
agencies and so it would be my
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that other sources of data
 
06:03:55.270 --> 06:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
um would be just as
 
06:03:58.390 --> 06:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
helpful uh it's also important to note
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the current registry um doesn't
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
involve consent I know that Hippa uh
 
06:04:06.150 --> 06:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily cover the government
 
06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
um but again I would say autism in this
 
06:04:10.910 --> 06:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
way is being treated as different than
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
any other diagnosis for some reason if
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
someone's diagnosed with schizophrenia
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
they're not added to a registry if
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
someone's diagnosed with ADHD they're
 
06:04:20.830 --> 06:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
not added to a registry it's just just
 
06:04:22.990 --> 06:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
autism and that really plays into I
 
06:04:25.670 --> 06:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
think a fear especially that that was
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
happening in the early 2000s around um
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
autism being an epidemic of some sort um
 
06:04:32.990 --> 06:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
that needed to be tracked specially and
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
I think we've come a long way in
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
realizing that it is another
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
developmental disability um it isn't an
 
06:04:41.590 --> 06:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
epidemic or something um that needs to
 
06:04:44.910 --> 06:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
be um a fear and so I will say with the
 
06:04:47.110 --> 06:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
current registry they are tracking more
 
06:04:50.190 --> 06:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
information than is required in the bill
 
06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
specifically in the area of your Social
 
06:04:54.548 --> 06:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
Security number um and again it's a
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
small state so in New Hampshire if
 
06:04:58.750 --> 06:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
someone gain access to that information
 
06:05:01.350 --> 06:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
it would be really easily identifiable
 
06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
again last four of your Social um your
 
06:05:05.628 --> 06:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
phone number your birthday that enough
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um is is that um I I'm
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that the DHHS does keep
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
that information in house I know a
 
06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
source of concern was any third parties
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
that might have access to that
 
06:05:20.190 --> 06:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
information so I was glad to learn that
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
um again I am definitely behind getting
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
rid of the registry completely but I
 
06:05:27.830 --> 06:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
think this bill even as is would be able
 
06:05:30.510 --> 06:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
to get us in the right direction um we
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
know that autism isn't necessarily a
 
06:05:34.468 --> 06:05:34.478 align:start position:0%
problem it's a phenomenon and people
 
06:05:36.590 --> 06:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
with Autism do deserve equal protection
 
06:05:38.468 --> 06:05:38.478 align:start position:0%
under the law that's what I have thank
 
06:05:39.990 --> 06:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
06:05:42.750 --> 06:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
you any
 
06:05:45.270 --> 06:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you awesome
 
06:05:45.280 --> 06:05:49.150 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you awesome
thank

06:05:49.150 --> 06:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:06:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
dejoy

06:06:00.990 --> 06:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
you don't indicate how much time you
 
06:06:03.830 --> 06:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
need but three minutes would be perfect
 
06:06:03.840 --> 06:06:05.788 align:start position:0%
need but three minutes would be perfect
for

06:06:05.788 --> 06:06:05.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:06:07.948 --> 06:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chair members of the
 
06:06:09.230 --> 06:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
 
06:06:11.190 --> 06:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
dejoy I am a lobbyist but I'm here
 
06:06:14.510 --> 06:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
representing myself uh specifically U as
 
06:06:18.548 --> 06:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of House Bill 1709 in
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
2006 there have been a number of
 
06:06:22.350 --> 06:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
questions about what why this bill came
 
06:06:24.070 --> 06:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
forward what the use of this bill is is
 
06:06:28.030 --> 06:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
it still useful uh I'd like to explain a
 
06:06:29.150 --> 06:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about that and then try to
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
answer questions it's I didn't never
 
06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
expect it 18 years later to be talking
 
06:06:35.150 --> 06:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
about this bill again nor did I expect
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
one of my students from UNH to be
 
06:06:40.390 --> 06:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
testifying before me so this uh this
 
06:06:42.270 --> 06:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
truly is a New Hampshire
 
06:06:46.270 --> 06:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
moment so when this bill was filed it
 
06:06:48.910 --> 06:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
was filed for the Autism Society of New
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was a group it was a
 
06:06:54.910 --> 06:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
parents group who um represented their
 
06:06:57.910 --> 06:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
children uh who were dealing with autism
 
06:07:00.270 --> 06:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
and were trying to expand services for
 
06:07:03.430 --> 06:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
the autism um for folks affected with
 
06:07:06.110 --> 06:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
autism it was not contemplated at that
 
06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
point that autism was an adult disease
 
06:07:10.708 --> 06:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
it was contemplated in 2006 as a
 
06:07:13.390 --> 06:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
childhood disease it was also
 
06:07:16.270 --> 06:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
contemplated as having any type any
 
06:07:18.390 --> 06:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
number of Nefarious
 
06:07:20.830 --> 06:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for its cause if you remember
 
06:07:23.548 --> 06:07:23.558 align:start position:0%
back to 2006 one of the primary theories
 
06:07:27.150 --> 06:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
was that uh mercury in vaccines is what
 
06:07:29.830 --> 06:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:34.230 --> 06:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
autism that was the intent of this bill
 
06:07:36.430 --> 06:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
it was never to provide services to
 
06:07:38.350 --> 06:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
individuals it was to permit the
 
06:07:41.590 --> 06:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
department to gather data so that the
 
06:07:45.548 --> 06:07:45.558 align:start position:0%
department could see the any growth in
 
06:07:47.548 --> 06:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh the number of people affected with
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
autism to be able to prepare Services
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
RIT large to Pro to provide what was
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
needed for the
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
community the other piece of this was
 
06:07:58.750 --> 06:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
that it was hoped that this data would
 
06:08:00.350 --> 06:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
be available to
 
06:08:02.468 --> 06:08:02.478 align:start position:0%
researchers you know the issue with data
 
06:08:04.868 --> 06:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
is once it goes by you can't go
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
backwards and collect data very
 
06:08:11.468 --> 06:08:11.478 align:start position:0%
easily so the the idea at this in 2006
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
was to collect as much data as we could
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
to permit researchers to have Ro a
 
06:08:20.590 --> 06:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
robust understanding potent hopefully of
 
06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
the cause of autism clearly the
 
06:08:26.468 --> 06:08:26.478 align:start position:0%
manifestations of um the condition but
 
06:08:28.468 --> 06:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully ultimately the cause I
 
06:08:30.468 --> 06:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
understand we still do not have a cause
 
06:08:31.830 --> 06:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
today for
 
06:08:34.830 --> 06:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
autism it maybe there isn't one that we
 
06:08:36.270 --> 06:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
can easily
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
identify but I think the data is as
 
06:08:41.830 --> 06:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
important today as it was 18 years
 
06:08:44.830 --> 06:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
ago the committee this
 
06:08:50.070 --> 06:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee took great pains to project
 
06:08:52.150 --> 06:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality not only because it was
 
06:08:53.628 --> 06:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do but because it was
 
06:08:55.310 --> 06:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
a room full of parents whose children
 
06:08:57.628 --> 06:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
had autism the parents knew their
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
children would be on this registry and
 
06:09:01.708 --> 06:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure that their
 
06:09:04.510 --> 06:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
children and any other children would be
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
protected from
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure um I'm comfortable that we
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
did a pretty good job back
 
06:09:15.070 --> 06:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
then I think the bill before you
 
06:09:16.590 --> 06:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's ways it can be
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
improved and that's great um but Jael
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
car had to approve all the
 
06:09:25.150 --> 06:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and so I'm comfortable that
 
06:09:29.230 --> 06:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
gel jel car complied with the statute in
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
terms of how far the department could go
 
06:09:34.590 --> 06:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
in making rules um to Mr Williams point
 
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
that Doe may have this data as well as
 
06:09:39.708 --> 06:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
DHHS what I said to him before the
 
06:09:42.990 --> 06:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
meeting is I don't have a vested
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
interest in where this data is tracked
 
06:09:48.510 --> 06:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
what I have a vested interest in is that
 
06:09:51.948 --> 06:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
this data is tracked anonymously fully
 
06:09:54.510 --> 06:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
anonymously and that it's available for
 
06:09:57.788 --> 06:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
researchers that hopefully will continue
 
06:10:00.670 --> 06:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
to work on a greater understanding of
 
06:10:03.390 --> 06:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
autism as well as how best to treat it
 
06:10:07.948 --> 06:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up yeah um with
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
that I I think I can just end my
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
comments um and I'd be happy to answer
 
06:10:15.070 --> 06:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman I'm this
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
is a curious situation where um
 
06:10:28.750 --> 06:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
where so 18 years ago we had parents and
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
advocates for people
 
06:10:35.190 --> 06:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
um with autism coming to ask for this
 
06:10:38.350 --> 06:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
and now um we're having the people
 
06:10:40.468 --> 06:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
who've spoke but they also referred to
 
06:10:42.830 --> 06:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
people calling them and getting calls
 
06:10:45.990 --> 06:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
about advocates for Advocates and maybe
 
06:10:48.430 --> 06:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
parents of people saying we want to get
 
06:10:51.510 --> 06:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
rid of this so what would you say that
 
06:10:55.350 --> 06:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
says about the evolution of our
 
06:10:58.548 --> 06:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
understanding of autism and um the
 
06:11:03.030 --> 06:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
acceptance of that as a diagnosis and um
 
06:11:04.990 --> 06:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
how far we've come in terms of providing
 
06:11:07.110 --> 06:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
services for these things thank you for
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
the question I think what I would say is
 
06:11:10.750 --> 06:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the information that was presented
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
is anecdotal so we don't know if it's
 
06:11:17.070 --> 06:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
one person or dozens of people I think
 
06:11:20.468 --> 06:11:20.478 align:start position:0%
to the extent I think we have evolved in
 
06:11:23.030 --> 06:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
our understanding and acceptance and
 
06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
treatment of autism I think one of the
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
reasons we've involved and I I don't
 
06:11:30.190 --> 06:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
know I mean this there's no evidence
 
06:11:33.150 --> 06:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
that this registry caused some of the
 
06:11:35.548 --> 06:11:35.558 align:start position:0%
understanding but certainly the registry
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
is correlated with a greater
 
06:11:39.948 --> 06:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
appreciation and public acknowledgement
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um of
 
06:11:45.628 --> 06:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
autism I think if it would be
 
06:11:47.310 --> 06:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate just like it would be
 
06:11:49.310 --> 06:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if we chose to abolish the
 
06:11:52.510 --> 06:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
cancer registry or we AB chose to
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
abolish any
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
registry I think the data is V vital and
 
06:11:59.670 --> 06:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
we cannot go back easily to recreate the
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
data I do think we have to go to Great
 
06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
pains to protect people's anonymity as
 
06:12:07.708 --> 06:12:07.718 align:start position:0%
we would in any
 
06:12:07.718 --> 06:12:09.390 align:start position:0%
we would in any
scientific

06:12:09.390 --> 06:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
06:12:12.708 --> 06:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
inquiry I don't know that opting out of
 
06:12:17.590 --> 06:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
the registry or removing your name at 18
 
06:12:21.510 --> 06:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
um benefits the scientific
 
06:12:23.868 --> 06:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
inquiry but I think assuring the
 
06:12:28.150 --> 06:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality certainly does
 
06:12:31.430 --> 06:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
06:12:34.510 --> 06:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you for taking thank you
 
06:12:36.270 --> 06:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking the
 
06:12:38.868 --> 06:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
question I we heard earlier Le I did
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
anyways that there's data that's
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
apparently available publicly that
 
06:12:45.350 --> 06:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't ensure
 
06:12:47.390 --> 06:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
confidentiality so I'm not sure how the
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
rules are written by I get through Jael
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
car but that is definitely a concern can
 
06:12:55.468 --> 06:12:55.478 align:start position:0%
you speak to that um because going back
 
06:12:58.510 --> 06:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
to it if the goal was confidentiality to
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
remain anonymous but there's data on the
 
06:13:04.230 --> 06:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
website that can drill down to someone's
 
06:13:06.788 --> 06:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
level of detail that sort of doesn't
 
06:13:06.798 --> 06:13:08.670 align:start position:0%
level of detail that sort of doesn't
remain

06:13:08.670 --> 06:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
remain
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
confidential I can't speak to the data
 
06:13:13.230 --> 06:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
that's presented now I haven't looked at
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
it recently I can speak to what I heard
 
06:13:17.110 --> 06:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
before which may have been a little
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
different than what you heard um and I
 
06:13:22.270 --> 06:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what the what is more
 
06:13:24.750 --> 06:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
accurate what I heard is that two
 
06:13:27.270 --> 06:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
different things were being conflated
 
06:13:29.670 --> 06:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that there is data available that should
 
06:13:32.948 --> 06:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
be in aggregate not in
 
06:13:35.350 --> 06:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
specific the other piece was that people
 
06:13:37.230 --> 06:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time were talking about the
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
information that is provided by
 
06:13:41.708 --> 06:13:41.718 align:start position:0%
pediatricians on the registry
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
form which would include um other
 
06:13:48.510 --> 06:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
information now the social security
 
06:13:49.868 --> 06:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
number to the best of my knowledge was
 
06:13:54.750 --> 06:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
never specified as a data field to be
 
06:13:57.150 --> 06:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
collected um it was always intended to
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
be a fully
 
06:14:05.310 --> 06:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
um to be a a unique Ida that could not
 
06:14:07.868 --> 06:14:07.878 align:start position:0%
be tracked back to the individual that
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
was the
 
06:14:12.030 --> 06:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
intent other
 
06:14:14.670 --> 06:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
 
06:14:16.430 --> 06:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
06:14:18.030 --> 06:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
question I you brought up a very
 
06:14:20.190 --> 06:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
interesting point about the 18-year-old
 
06:14:22.030 --> 06:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
thing and that that really troubled me a
 
06:14:25.750 --> 06:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
lot I mean if we want to collect data we
 
06:14:28.270 --> 06:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
really want want to know where these how
 
06:14:29.910 --> 06:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
autism is affecting people over the
 
06:14:32.070 --> 06:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
entire scope of life not just before
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
they turn 18 and I'm just curious what
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are about that addition to
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment to this bill I have that
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
as well as gender circled as things that
 
06:14:44.270 --> 06:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
should be should remain in the registry
 
06:14:46.270 --> 06:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
to the to the extent that the registry
 
06:14:48.868 --> 06:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
remains I think both of those pieces of
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
information should
 
06:14:55.190 --> 06:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's data is important data is how we've
 
06:15:01.830 --> 06:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
learned I mean you're a doctor data is
 
06:15:04.670 --> 06:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
how we've learned about disease and how
 
06:15:06.990 --> 06:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
we've eradicated disease how we've dealt
 
06:15:10.510 --> 06:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
with um epidemics in the past this was
 
06:15:13.868 --> 06:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
an epidemic in 2006 this was an epidemic
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
of our boys who were disproportionately
 
06:15:20.230 --> 06:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with
 
06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
autism people didn't understand why
 
06:15:24.910 --> 06:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know where it came from didn't
 
06:15:26.910 --> 06:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
know how to fix it and at that point
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
we're talking about fixing
 
06:15:32.310 --> 06:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
it I don't know what's happened with the
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
data as far as research but I think it's
 
06:15:39.788 --> 06:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
still as vital today as it was 18 years
 
06:15:45.430 --> 06:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:47.868 --> 06:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
Weber would you agree with me that the
 
06:15:51.670 --> 06:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
concern with data is when you start
 
06:15:56.190 --> 06:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
self- selecting in one way or another
 
06:16:00.468 --> 06:16:00.478 align:start position:0%
the data becomes much less useful in the
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
aggregate to give
 
06:16:08.190 --> 06:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
us a clear picture of what's going on
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
out there so that once you
 
06:16:16.030 --> 06:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
start allowing people as I think we
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
should to choose whether their data goes
 
06:16:22.708 --> 06:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
in whether their data stays how the and
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
all of that does that not make the data
 
06:16:30.190 --> 06:16:30.200 align:start position:0%
by definition less useful as data than
 
06:16:33.628 --> 06:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
it would be if we were fully
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
reporting thank you for the question
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative it does and in fact in
 
06:16:40.110 --> 06:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
research it makes it frankly misleading
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
because researchers will come to um
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
findings that they will believe to be
 
06:16:47.230 --> 06:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
accurate but because of the data set
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
they would be wholly
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
inaccurate other
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions saying no other questions
 
06:16:58.190 --> 06:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:59.750 --> 06:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay I have no other pink cards no one
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
else has signed up to speak on hp1 1615
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
FN two people did sign the blue sheet in
 
06:17:08.590 --> 06:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
the back in support of the bill online
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh nine have indicated they support it
 
06:17:13.230 --> 06:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
and two indicate they oppos it so I'm
 
06:17:15.270 --> 06:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on hb1
 
06:17:18.670 --> 06:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
1615 FN I'm going to open the public
 
06:17:20.510 --> 06:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
1482 and at this time I'll recognize the
 
06:17:33.070 --> 06:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:34.670 --> 06:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the
 
06:17:36.910 --> 06:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative Jason Gard
 
06:17:38.788 --> 06:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
representing Franklin Northfield marac
 
06:17:40.990 --> 06:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
25 I understand you guys are only an
 
06:17:42.628 --> 06:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
hour and 15 minutes behind schedule so
 
06:17:44.230 --> 06:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
I'll move
 
06:17:46.350 --> 06:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
quickly this bill would allow for the
 
06:17:48.990 --> 06:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
sale of blood and organs in the state of
 
06:17:50.708 --> 06:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire without government
 
06:17:53.750 --> 06:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
interference currently we are allowed to
 
06:17:58.110 --> 06:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
sell plasma sperm eggs hair breast milk
 
06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
bone marrow stool rent space on your
 
06:18:04.110 --> 06:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
skin via tattoos or other advertising
 
06:18:06.190 --> 06:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
participate in clinical trials which
 
06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
might just turn out to be deadly you can
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
rent your womb as
 
06:18:12.430 --> 06:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
well I would like to just read a very
 
06:18:14.628 --> 06:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
just some excerpts from an article that
 
06:18:16.270 --> 06:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
a supporter wrote in favor of this
 
06:18:18.548 --> 06:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
legislation that I think is interesting
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and highlights some topics that may not
 
06:18:25.230 --> 06:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
be uh immediately apparent there is an
 
06:18:26.948 --> 06:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
there is a per ual chronic blood
 
06:18:29.070 --> 06:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
shortage since I'm an no negative blood
 
06:18:31.590 --> 06:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
type universal blood donor and cytom
 
06:18:33.430 --> 06:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
megavirus negative a disease that most
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
adults have been exposed to but is fatal
 
06:18:37.190 --> 06:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
if babies are exposed to it I am
 
06:18:38.750 --> 06:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
constantly bombarded with emails from
 
06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Red Cross soliciting my blood
 
06:18:42.510 --> 06:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately I don't ate my blood as
 
06:18:44.110 --> 06:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
often as they allow me to but not
 
06:18:46.708 --> 06:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
everyone is like me in fact most people
 
06:18:48.670 --> 06:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
are not according to the Red Cross only
 
06:18:51.310 --> 06:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
3% of eligible people donate blood and
 
06:18:53.390 --> 06:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
only 7% of people are O Negative with a
 
06:18:54.628 --> 06:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
guarantee that most of these people do
 
06:18:58.230 --> 06:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
not donate and are likely not cyto virus
 
06:19:00.430 --> 06:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
negative as a result is a coin to us
 
06:19:02.590 --> 06:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not a newborn will obtain
 
06:19:04.868 --> 06:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
life-saving treatment since there is not
 
06:19:06.590 --> 06:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
enough time to test a newborn's blood
 
06:19:09.190 --> 06:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
type ahead of time how do we solve this
 
06:19:10.468 --> 06:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
the best way to provide additional
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
incentives for eligible people to be
 
06:19:13.670 --> 06:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
able to donate their blood imagine if we
 
06:19:15.750 --> 06:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
can only eat food from Farmers that
 
06:19:17.990 --> 06:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
donated their time and labor to produce
 
06:19:20.390 --> 06:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
it that is a situation we are now in
 
06:19:21.948 --> 06:19:21.958 align:start position:0%
with blood by allowing people to be
 
06:19:23.468 --> 06:19:23.478 align:start position:0%
compensated for donating their blood we
 
06:19:25.830 --> 06:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
could readily inre increase the supply
 
06:19:28.230 --> 06:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
especially if people are paid more given
 
06:19:30.070 --> 06:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
their blood type or eligibility imagine
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
what parents would pay to have their
 
06:19:33.830 --> 06:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
child's life saved instead of having to
 
06:19:36.590 --> 06:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
exclusively rely on donations which are
 
06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
severely insufficient also do not expect
 
06:19:40.270 --> 06:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
purchasing blood in this instance to be
 
06:19:42.190 --> 06:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive with minimal
 
06:19:44.350 --> 06:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
government barriers to entry many people
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
will donate which will substantially
 
06:19:48.230 --> 06:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
increase the supply and allow for a
 
06:19:50.390 --> 06:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable market price for blood
 
06:19:51.628 --> 06:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
Americans are already allowed to sell
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
their blood plasma and sperms there's no
 
06:19:54.910 --> 06:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
reason they should not be allowed to
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
sell their whole blood and or other
 
06:19:59.430 --> 06:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
blood products for money while some may
 
06:20:01.190 --> 06:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
argue there are ethical implications
 
06:20:02.590 --> 06:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
being with being able to legally sell
 
06:20:04.270 --> 06:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
your blood and or organs I assert that
 
06:20:05.548 --> 06:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
the real ethical violations are
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
manifested when the government imposes
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
barriers against being able to do this
 
06:20:12.350 --> 06:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
not only does it make organs and bloods
 
06:20:14.310 --> 06:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh blood less available to people that
 
06:20:15.990 --> 06:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
are in chronic need of them it also
 
06:20:19.270 --> 06:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
implies that other people own your blood
 
06:20:21.070 --> 06:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
and your organs since they are allowed
 
06:20:22.910 --> 06:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
to tell you what you can and cannot do
 
06:20:25.070 --> 06:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
with them this is a form of tacd slavery
 
06:20:26.030 --> 06:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
that should not be allowed allowed to
 
06:20:28.910 --> 06:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
persist in the 21st century if you value
 
06:20:30.070 --> 06:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
Freedom or would like to improve the
 
06:20:31.750 --> 06:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
survival of babies and chronically ill
 
06:20:33.430 --> 06:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
people you agree that is time to end is
 
06:20:35.310 --> 06:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition on being able to do what you
 
06:20:37.750 --> 06:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
want with your own body to help others
 
06:20:40.310 --> 06:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
with an added
 
06:20:42.868 --> 06:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
incentive and I just like to add that in
 
06:20:46.628 --> 06:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
2017 the hill ran an article where they
 
06:20:48.030 --> 06:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
discussed that the Orange County
 
06:20:49.390 --> 06:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
District Attorney's Office in Southern
 
06:20:51.548 --> 06:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
California prosecuted Planned Parenthood
 
06:20:54.190 --> 06:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
business partners D Vinci biosciences
 
06:20:57.230 --> 06:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
and DV biologics who signed a $7.8
 
06:20:58.628 --> 06:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
million settlement in which they were
 
06:20:59.990 --> 06:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
banned from doing business in state of
 
06:21:01.430 --> 06:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
California ever again admitted to
 
06:21:02.910 --> 06:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
Breaking state and federal laws by
 
06:21:05.350 --> 06:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
selling a board aborted fetal organs and
 
06:21:07.430 --> 06:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
tissues from Planned Parenthood for
 
06:21:11.070 --> 06:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
profit so organs are already being sold
 
06:21:13.310 --> 06:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's not a question the question is
 
06:21:15.150 --> 06:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
who is benefiting from it and it's not
 
06:21:18.430 --> 06:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
the people who actually own those organs
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
so that's where this comes down to and
 
06:21:22.750 --> 06:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
the last thing is the New Hampshire end
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
of life options act hb1 1283 was
 
06:21:24.958 --> 06:21:26.708 align:start position:0%
of life options act hb1 1283 was
recently

06:21:26.708 --> 06:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
recently
 
06:21:28.468 --> 06:21:28.478 align:start position:0%
introduced and this is the medical Aid
 
06:21:31.510 --> 06:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
in dying it's allowed in 10 states in
 
06:21:33.190 --> 06:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
the District of Columbia so you're
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to and it's being proposed to do
 
06:21:36.548 --> 06:21:36.558 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire you're allowed to
 
06:21:39.030 --> 06:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
kill yourself but you can't sell your
 
06:21:41.788 --> 06:21:41.798 align:start position:0%
kidney I think we got to go back to the
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
the old adage my body my choice and you
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to do what what what you
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
wish with your body since it's your body
 
06:21:51.708 --> 06:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
and the government does not own your
 
06:21:53.830 --> 06:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
body so that's all I have to say and if
 
06:21:55.190 --> 06:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions I'd be
 
06:21:56.670 --> 06:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
interested answer them if I can
 
06:21:58.868 --> 06:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
06:22:01.510 --> 06:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh taking questions uh I'm with you 100%
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
on the whole being able to do this sort
 
06:22:07.708 --> 06:22:07.718 align:start position:0%
of thing there's a book I think that
 
06:22:09.750 --> 06:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
came out a while ago called when
 
06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
altruism isn't enough it's been a long
 
06:22:14.510 --> 06:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
time I I never read the book and I'm not
 
06:22:16.110 --> 06:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
sure if I'm even right on that but
 
06:22:18.350 --> 06:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
basically the idea is that there's a lot
 
06:22:21.070 --> 06:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
of people that um could really benefit
 
06:22:23.070 --> 06:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
from this that are dying every day and
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
there are people that could benefit from
 
06:22:26.910 --> 06:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
selling an extra kidney that they you
 
06:22:28.430 --> 06:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
know they're they're not inclined to go
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
give it away and go through the
 
06:22:32.310 --> 06:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
procedure and all that but um for a
 
06:22:33.910 --> 06:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
healthy price they probably would and
 
06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
that could benefit a lot of people both
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
parties um but I'd like you to talk a
 
06:22:40.390 --> 06:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
little bit about your bill because um
 
06:22:43.548 --> 06:22:43.558 align:start position:0%
while you made the the case for the the
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
philosophy um you didn't speak on the
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill too much um one of the things I
 
06:22:52.270 --> 06:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
like to do at least in in my world is um
 
06:22:54.628 --> 06:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
when I see a problem the government has
 
06:22:56.750 --> 06:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
created I like to find those lines of
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
code and just delete them as opposed to
 
06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
making new lines of code and what I see
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
here is you know it looks like there's
 
06:23:25.548 --> 06:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:28.510 --> 06:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just a little confused why you
 
06:23:31.070 --> 06:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
know section c we're talking about
 
06:23:33.270 --> 06:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
testing of cannabis therapeutic can and
 
06:23:35.708 --> 06:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden it's talking about
 
06:23:38.868 --> 06:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
blood and organs uh I'm just I'm just I
 
06:23:40.788 --> 06:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just curious why those
 
06:23:43.190 --> 06:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
two are together like that and and
 
06:23:45.868 --> 06:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't couldn't we just scrap lines of
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
code as opposed to making new ones thank
 
06:23:51.150 --> 06:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
you sure the simple answer is I'm a
 
06:23:53.750 --> 06:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
carpenter so I actually trust in OS
 
06:23:57.070 --> 06:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
which is a many times that goes south so
 
06:23:58.310 --> 06:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is in your hands in the
 
06:24:00.110 --> 06:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I am that's actually a
 
06:24:02.030 --> 06:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
really good point don't add simply take
 
06:24:04.590 --> 06:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
away so I'm totally on board with that
 
06:24:06.190 --> 06:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
however you guys wish to make this
 
06:24:08.788 --> 06:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
happen that would be awesome that's
 
06:24:12.628 --> 06:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
that's what I'll say on that other
 
06:24:15.070 --> 06:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
questions so no other questions thank
 
06:24:18.590 --> 06:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:21.510 --> 06:24:21.520 align:start position:0%

06:24:27.910 --> 06:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll try to tap it to three if
 
06:24:30.070 --> 06:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
you could please yes absolutely thank
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%

for transplant in New England and New

Hampshire and we oppose House Bill 1482
 
06:24:54.910 --> 06:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just pick out four points
 
06:24:54.920 --> 06:24:56.628 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just pick out four points
number

06:24:56.628 --> 06:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:25:00.310 --> 06:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
one the system of transplant is designed
 
06:25:03.670 --> 06:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
to maximize life-saving transplant and
 
06:25:07.350 --> 06:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
ensure safety each donated organ is
 
06:25:09.548 --> 06:25:09.558 align:start position:0%
medically evaluated for transplant and
 
06:25:11.430 --> 06:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
this includes extensive medical

06:25:27.310 --> 06:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
reent and also in the case of living
 
06:25:30.430 --> 06:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
donation for the donor so uh organs that
 
06:25:32.590 --> 06:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
are from deceased donors are then
 
06:25:34.270 --> 06:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
determined medically suitable for
 
06:25:36.628 --> 06:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
transplant if they are they're offered
 
06:25:38.150 --> 06:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
to waiting patients that are a
 
06:25:40.708 --> 06:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
biological match another key part of the
 
06:25:42.910 --> 06:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
national oversight here through the
 
06:25:45.230 --> 06:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
transplant surgeon according to the
 
06:25:47.190 --> 06:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
National transplant weight list by the
 
06:25:49.110 --> 06:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
organ procurement transplant Network and
 
06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is operated by the US Health and
 
06:25:51.840 --> 06:25:53.110 align:start position:0%
this is operated by the US Health and
Human

06:25:53.110 --> 06:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
Human
 
06:25:55.750 --> 06:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
Services um this is a well regulated
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
system it continues to grow
 
06:25:58.708 --> 06:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
transplantation which is important for
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
you to know nationally 2023 was the 13th
 
06:26:04.708 --> 06:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
consecutive year in a row for donation
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
and Transplant increases here in New
 
06:26:08.830 --> 06:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
England and in New Hampshire new records
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
were set last year for organ donation
 
06:26:14.830 --> 06:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
and Transplant 52% increase from 2022 so
 
06:26:16.628 --> 06:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
this is not a static system it is a
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
dynamic one that continues to grow the
 
06:26:21.788 --> 06:26:21.798 align:start position:0%
second reason is that this bill would
 
06:26:23.948 --> 06:26:23.958 align:start position:0%
compromise transplant patient safety
 
06:26:25.510 --> 06:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would open the door do
 
06:26:26.948 --> 06:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
literally in New Hampshire for
 
06:26:28.990 --> 06:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
unregulated private sale of organs
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
between individuals from anywhere
 
06:26:33.270 --> 06:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
nationally or internationally there's
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that would prevent
 
06:26:35.948 --> 06:26:35.958 align:start position:0%
individuals coming in to sell their
 
06:26:38.110 --> 06:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
organs or individuals coming in to buy
 
06:26:40.670 --> 06:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
organs this kind of rules free market
 
06:26:43.390 --> 06:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
for deceased and living organs would
 
06:26:45.510 --> 06:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
create substantial medical risks both
 
06:26:48.110 --> 06:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
for living donors and for transplant
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
recipients that would not be subject to
 
06:26:51.830 --> 06:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
the extensive medical screening I just
 
06:26:54.548 --> 06:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
already mentioned uh it's not even clear
 
06:26:56.510 --> 06:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
if these and paid organs would be
 
06:26:59.590 --> 06:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
subject to uh the criteria mentioned for
 
06:27:01.910 --> 06:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
health and safety or even that they
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
would need to be performed these
 
06:27:04.990 --> 06:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
transplants would need to be performed
 
06:27:07.468 --> 06:27:07.478 align:start position:0%
by a licensed physician number three
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
unregulated organ markets are unethical
 
06:27:12.310 --> 06:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
and one thing to point out here that
 
06:27:15.510 --> 06:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
unlike blood or semen or human milk
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
organs do not regenerate so we're
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
talking about kidneys primarily are what
 
06:27:22.070 --> 06:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
are donated and living donors that
 
06:27:23.830 --> 06:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
donate their kidney do not grow back an
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
additional kidney this is very very
 
06:27:27.670 --> 06:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
different and it should be treated
 
06:27:29.788 --> 06:27:29.798 align:start position:0%
differently in policy there's a real
 
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
potential for physical exploitation
 
06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
exploitation of vulnerable individuals
 
06:27:37.230 --> 06:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
who could be coerced into selling their
 
06:27:39.830 --> 06:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
body parts for financial gain this could
 
06:27:42.948 --> 06:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
create a perverse market system where
 
06:27:44.868 --> 06:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
body parts of the poor become
 
06:27:47.390 --> 06:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
commodities for the rich to gain
 
06:27:49.350 --> 06:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
preferential access to lifesaving
 
06:27:52.190 --> 06:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
transplant the market price completely
 
06:27:53.990 --> 06:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
unregulated would look pretty different
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
for someone who is destined ude than
 
06:27:58.868 --> 06:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
someone who has a well-paying job who
 
06:28:00.990 --> 06:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
might not be incentivized by the same
 
06:28:03.468 --> 06:28:03.478 align:start position:0%
dollar amount so this unethical
 
06:28:05.310 --> 06:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
Confluence of pressures could literally
 
06:28:07.548 --> 06:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire the international
 
06:28:09.788 --> 06:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
epicenter of human organ trafficking and
 
06:28:11.548 --> 06:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
I say that because there are no states
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the US and only one nation in the
 
06:28:17.030 --> 06:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
world that has laws that allow for the
 
06:28:19.190 --> 06:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
buying and selling of organs and that
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
nation is
 
06:28:22.868 --> 06:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
Iran it has a regulated not an
 
06:28:25.110 --> 06:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
unregulated market and there are wide
 
06:28:27.708 --> 06:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
spread reports of coercion in Iran both
 
06:28:30.670 --> 06:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
for the donor being coerced into selling
 
06:28:33.510 --> 06:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
and also the recipient where the
 
06:28:36.310 --> 06:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
recipients uh are sometimes held hostage
 
06:28:38.070 --> 06:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
right before the transplant surgery
 
06:28:39.910 --> 06:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
where the donor then Demands a higher
 
06:28:42.910 --> 06:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount in order to go to the
 
06:28:46.150 --> 06:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
O so the fourth and last point I have is
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
that this is preempted by federal law
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
and current New Hampshire law so the
 
06:28:51.510 --> 06:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
United States Congress and New Hampshire
 
06:28:53.070 --> 06:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
have already determined that private
 
06:28:54.510 --> 06:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
commercial markets don't serve the
 
06:28:57.510 --> 06:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
interest of donors or recipients uh the
 
06:28:59.350 --> 06:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
national organ transplant act
 
06:29:01.230 --> 06:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
specifically and clearly prohibits the
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
buying and selling of organs and would
 
06:29:06.510 --> 06:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
prevent would preempt HB
 
06:29:09.990 --> 06:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
1482 and New Hampshire's own state law
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
at chapter 291a which codifies The
 
06:29:14.910 --> 06:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
Uniform Anatomical Gift Act which is a
 
06:29:16.910 --> 06:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
uniform state law that's been passed in
 
06:29:19.468 --> 06:29:19.478 align:start position:0%
every state in the country also forbids
 
06:29:21.788 --> 06:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
sales and makes it a felony so in
 
06:29:23.830 --> 06:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion the process of organ donation
 
06:29:26.590 --> 06:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
is really medically complex it involves
 
06:29:29.190 --> 06:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
numerous well-regulated institutions
 
06:29:30.910 --> 06:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
working in concert with trained
 
06:29:32.990 --> 06:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
professionals it has to be accomplished
 
06:29:36.510 --> 06:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
in critically short time frames and that
 
06:29:38.548 --> 06:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
that the organs that are donated need to
 
06:29:40.948 --> 06:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
be recovered and transplanted quickly
 
06:29:43.708 --> 06:29:43.718 align:start position:0%
for medically suitable donors in order
 
06:29:45.510 --> 06:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
for life-saving transplant to be
 
06:29:47.708 --> 06:29:47.718 align:start position:0%
successful our system is founded on
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
ethical principles to ensure voluntary
 
06:29:51.948 --> 06:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
participation and donation and these
 
06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks have served to make our
 
06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
system medically safe
 
06:29:58.390 --> 06:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
ethical efficient but importantly also
 
06:30:00.750 --> 06:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
constantly improving for the patients in
 
06:30:03.468 --> 06:30:03.478 align:start position:0%
need I'm happy to take any questions
 
06:30:03.478 --> 06:30:07.030 align:start position:0%
need I'm happy to take any questions
representative

06:30:07.030 --> 06:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:09.390 --> 06:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:30:10.910 --> 06:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question could
 
06:30:16.150 --> 06:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
you um get to us um the uh a link to the
 
06:30:18.468 --> 06:30:18.478 align:start position:0%
federal laws that preempt this kind of
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
law absolutely and followup followup um
 
06:30:26.468 --> 06:30:26.478 align:start position:0%
you spoke about organs which which is um
 
06:30:28.510 --> 06:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
your purview obviously but do you have
 
06:30:31.070 --> 06:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
anything to say about the other part of
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
the bill that would include blood and
 
06:30:34.990 --> 06:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
blood products I would just say that
 
06:30:37.830 --> 06:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
unregulated markets are unprecedented in
 
06:30:40.230 --> 06:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
the medical community and there are
 
06:30:43.110 --> 06:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
important health and safety regulations
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:49.388 --> 06:30:49.398 align:start position:0%
considered other
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you thank
 
06:30:53.760 --> 06:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you thank
you

06:30:57.750 --> 06:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:07.868 --> 06:31:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:11.230 --> 06:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
wood and you've asked for two minutes uh
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
06:31:14.670 --> 06:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh giving me your time and for being
 
06:31:17.230 --> 06:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
here on uh Valentine's Day I appreciate
 
06:31:20.708 --> 06:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
it um so this is an issue that's really
 
06:31:23.948 --> 06:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
important to me um I I do like taking
 
06:31:25.708 --> 06:31:25.718 align:start position:0%
part of the political process here in
 
06:31:27.548 --> 06:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but there aren't many
 
06:31:29.830 --> 06:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
bills that have affected uh me
 
06:31:31.350 --> 06:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
personally or friends that I have
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
personally I'd say that this is one of
 
06:31:35.868 --> 06:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
the only ones so I decided today that I
 
06:31:37.750 --> 06:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
would tell you a story about my friend
 
06:31:41.670 --> 06:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
his name was Daniel um
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
he he was diagnosed as uh suffering from
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
diabetes um and he uh was able to
 
06:31:52.110 --> 06:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
survive with it for uh quite a while he
 
06:31:54.948 --> 06:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
received treatment um but he was on the
 
06:31:59.230 --> 06:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh donor list for ages um because there
 
06:32:01.708 --> 06:32:01.718 align:start position:0%
there weren't any donor matches uh for
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
him and if you look at the uh the kidney
 
06:32:06.350 --> 06:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
registry it's really long um and there's
 
06:32:10.990 --> 06:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people uh waiting for it um and
 
06:32:14.990 --> 06:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um when covid happened uh
 
06:32:17.670 --> 06:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
the um you know the medical system was
 
06:32:19.948 --> 06:32:19.958 align:start position:0%
pressured and it it put those pressures
 
06:32:24.350 --> 06:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
on um not just the supply of kidneys but
 
06:32:27.708 --> 06:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
also so on the amount of uh medical
 
06:32:28.868 --> 06:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
professionals that would be able to
 
06:32:33.310 --> 06:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate these operations so um so the
 
06:32:35.590 --> 06:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
list got longer and longer and then they
 
06:32:37.990 --> 06:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
changed the requirements to make it so
 
06:32:41.430 --> 06:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
that um if you weren't vaccinated for
 
06:32:43.310 --> 06:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
covid you would automatically be be
 
06:32:47.590 --> 06:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
taken off the list um this this was a um
 
06:32:52.150 --> 06:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
Daniel was a um person who um had very
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
strict religious beliefs about um
 
06:32:58.150 --> 06:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines he he he didn't want to put his
 
06:32:59.948 --> 06:32:59.958 align:start position:0%
um Health further in Jeopardy than it
 
06:33:02.270 --> 06:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
already was so he opted out of it and
 
06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
was removed from the list um he thought
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
about maybe going out of the country to
 
06:33:11.788 --> 06:33:11.798 align:start position:0%
see if he could um you know purchase a
 
06:33:13.628 --> 06:33:13.638 align:start position:0%
kidney because his life was in Jeopardy
 
06:33:15.868 --> 06:33:15.878 align:start position:0%
but he realized that the moral and legal
 
06:33:18.110 --> 06:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
implications of that would be too much
 
06:33:21.948 --> 06:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
for him um he didn't want to um you know
 
06:33:24.868 --> 06:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
do a shady Market deal where he's trying
 
06:33:27.310 --> 06:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
to get um somebody's kidney even if he
 
06:33:29.670 --> 06:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
thought like okay this person's a total
 
06:33:32.590 --> 06:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
totally willing participant um he just
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
didn't feel morally comfortable doing
 
06:33:39.230 --> 06:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
that um and so unfortunately he passed
 
06:33:42.750 --> 06:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
away um he was somebody that loved to do
 
06:33:47.190 --> 06:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
poetry he um he was loved by members of
 
06:33:51.190 --> 06:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
his community he had a family um he he
 
06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of money so um the
 
06:33:55.150 --> 06:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
community actually
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
um crowdfunded a a wonderful funeral
 
06:34:02.868 --> 06:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
service for him um and and I I think
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
that if this bill or a variation of it I
 
06:34:06.990 --> 06:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
mean you're the committee members if you
 
06:34:08.468 --> 06:34:08.478 align:start position:0%
want to change it to make it more in
 
06:34:11.510 --> 06:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
line to something that's regulated or or
 
06:34:13.948 --> 06:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
removing lines of code I I think that
 
06:34:17.190 --> 06:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
that would be fair um but I I believe
 
06:34:20.230 --> 06:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
that if there was a framework in place
 
06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
um for a willing participant like me for
 
06:34:28.830 --> 06:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
example to have um given him my kidney
 
06:34:32.310 --> 06:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
for compensation like that I I think
 
06:34:34.590 --> 06:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
he'd probably still be alive today and I
 
06:34:37.750 --> 06:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
know that there are lots of examples of
 
06:34:39.628 --> 06:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
of people like this it's it's not just
 
06:34:41.190 --> 06:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
Daniel there's there's tons of people
 
06:34:44.750 --> 06:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
that are affected by diabetes and uh and
 
06:34:47.548 --> 06:34:47.558 align:start position:0%
kidneys are just one example um like
 
06:34:51.750 --> 06:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
like the uh uh State red mentioned um
 
06:34:53.910 --> 06:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
there there's people that are in chronic
 
06:34:57.230 --> 06:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
need of of of blood as well um and I
 
06:34:59.388 --> 06:34:59.398 align:start position:0%
think that we shouldn't put barriers
 
06:35:01.590 --> 06:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
between someone being compensated to
 
06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
save a life that I think that that's
 
06:35:05.388 --> 06:35:05.398 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to um I'm willing to
 
06:35:08.270 --> 06:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions any
 
06:35:11.070 --> 06:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon um thank
 
06:35:12.788 --> 06:35:12.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for being
 
06:35:14.750 --> 06:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
here and I'm so sorry for the loss of
 
06:35:17.708 --> 06:35:17.718 align:start position:0%
your friend um we had passed a bill
 
06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
previously about not discriminating
 
06:35:22.830 --> 06:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
about vaccine status for healthcare um
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
would you mind sharing when your friend
 
06:35:27.548 --> 06:35:27.558 align:start position:0%
was removed from the registry yeah um it
 
06:35:29.868 --> 06:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
was a couple years ago I'd say that it
 
06:35:34.190 --> 06:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
was maybe like about a a year after the
 
06:35:37.430 --> 06:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
um vaccines were rolled out um if if you
 
06:35:39.388 --> 06:35:39.398 align:start position:0%
want I emailed everybody on the
 
06:35:41.788 --> 06:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
committee including um you so if you
 
06:35:43.270 --> 06:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
want I could reach out to you later and
 
06:35:44.708 --> 06:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
provide you an exact date that he was
 
06:35:46.830 --> 06:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
denied I would appreciate that because
 
06:35:48.430 --> 06:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
it seems that sometimes we pass laws
 
06:35:51.750 --> 06:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
that don't actually um have an impact so
 
06:35:54.388 --> 06:35:54.398 align:start position:0%
um it would be unfortunate if he simply
 
06:35:56.990 --> 06:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
was not not within the time frame but it
 
06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
would be an even more even more of a
 
06:35:59.510 --> 06:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
travesty if he should have been
 
06:36:02.030 --> 06:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
protected and he wasn't yeah I mean and
 
06:36:04.030 --> 06:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
he did live in uh New Hampshire he lived
 
06:36:05.708 --> 06:36:05.718 align:start position:0%
in Manchester so I think that he would
 
06:36:07.990 --> 06:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
be protected by this if if it was in
 
06:36:10.510 --> 06:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
effect at the time
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
sorry other
 
06:36:19.270 --> 06:36:19.280 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Funeral Directors Association

some of you have seen me before for um
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm also licensed funeral director
 
06:36:59.590 --> 06:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
in Balmer here in New Hampshire I'm here
 
06:37:01.948 --> 06:37:01.958 align:start position:0%
uh to uh before you today to uh in
 
06:37:03.388 --> 06:37:03.398 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
06:37:05.948 --> 06:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
bill the various things that that raised
 
06:37:08.510 --> 06:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
concerns when I first read this uh my
 
06:37:10.070 --> 06:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
first concern was why and you know it's
 
06:37:13.310 --> 06:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
a purpose the the sponsor addressed that
 
06:37:14.910 --> 06:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
but of course I always kind of look at
 
06:37:16.670 --> 06:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
the big picture and as to what could
 
06:37:18.270 --> 06:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
could go wrong and this is kind of a
 
06:37:20.788 --> 06:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
very broad a broad interpretation of
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
this bill I I respect his his position
 
06:37:24.910 --> 06:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
and his so for I'm a
 
06:37:27.350 --> 06:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh believer in in U you know personal
 
06:37:29.910 --> 06:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
freedom and and those things Our concern
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
is of the of Public Health and Welfare
 
06:37:34.510 --> 06:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh and also ethical issues of handling
 
06:37:36.310 --> 06:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
and the disposition of these body parts
 
06:37:38.750 --> 06:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
and fluids it's the representative from
 
06:37:40.150 --> 06:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Oregon Bank who we
 
06:37:41.670 --> 06:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
work very closely with in Funeral
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
Service uh in terms of donors when it
 
06:37:46.070 --> 06:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
comes to organs no those are done in the
 
06:37:48.310 --> 06:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
O and the hospital but when it comes to
 
06:37:51.110 --> 06:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
other tissues and Don and and uh other
 
06:37:54.388 --> 06:37:54.398 align:start position:0%
tissues and corneas uh they're often
 
06:37:56.510 --> 06:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
those things are often harvested or
 
06:37:59.548 --> 06:37:59.558 align:start position:0%
retrieved in the funeral home and I also
 
06:38:02.990 --> 06:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
have to point out that uh in my uh
 
06:38:05.868 --> 06:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
anatomical education uh in mortuary
 
06:38:07.670 --> 06:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
school is that skin is the L largest
 
06:38:09.430 --> 06:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
organ in the body okay so if we're
 
06:38:11.350 --> 06:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
talking organs we're talking talking
 
06:38:14.110 --> 06:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
skin of course they do uh do that for
 
06:38:16.590 --> 06:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
tissue donors for burn victims and and
 
06:38:19.708 --> 06:38:19.718 align:start position:0%
in other cases like that um and you know
 
06:38:22.190 --> 06:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have people what we've had in in the
 
06:38:24.750 --> 06:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
country in the last several years is not
 
06:38:26.190 --> 06:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
so much in the Northeast but we've
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
seeing it more and more across the
 
06:38:30.150 --> 06:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
country particularly in the Southwest is
 
06:38:32.430 --> 06:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
we have uh basically unlicensed
 
06:38:36.548 --> 06:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
thirdparty providers who are offering on
 
06:38:39.190 --> 06:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
billboards uh free cremation if you
 
06:38:42.310 --> 06:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
donate your loved On's body for medical
 
06:38:45.270 --> 06:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
science what happens in these cases and
 
06:38:47.468 --> 06:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
this I won't get too graphic is the
 
06:38:49.788 --> 06:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
family comes they're bed but this they
 
06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
may not have that that $500 or ,000 or
 
06:38:54.310 --> 06:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
more that they would need for that
 
06:38:56.110 --> 06:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
cremation this is a very attractive
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
offer and so they sign documents that
 
06:39:00.150 --> 06:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
they have no idea they're signing and
 
06:39:01.628 --> 06:39:01.638 align:start position:0%
basically what they're doing is they're
 
06:39:03.350 --> 06:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
turning their loved ones body over to
 
06:39:05.868 --> 06:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
these individuals who then take that
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
body and quite frankly part it out and
 
06:39:11.070 --> 06:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
it is used yes for medical research and
 
06:39:13.788 --> 06:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
other things it's been some cases where
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
they have been used for ballistic tests
 
06:39:16.910 --> 06:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
with the
 
06:39:20.670 --> 06:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
military um and and other instances like
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
that and what happens is the parties the
 
06:39:26.030 --> 06:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
parts are either sold or leased and they
 
06:39:28.030 --> 06:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
can be leased over and over again or
 
06:39:30.750 --> 06:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
resold there is no act no ability of
 
06:39:34.590 --> 06:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
tracking this at all um and eventually
 
06:39:37.868 --> 06:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
uh those B those body the parts never
 
06:39:39.990 --> 06:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
come back to the family I'm not sure
 
06:39:41.708 --> 06:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
what they're given in return as far as
 
06:39:44.628 --> 06:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
cremated remains uh but the the fact
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they're told that that's what
 
06:39:47.910 --> 06:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll receive is is is
 
06:39:50.388 --> 06:39:50.398 align:start position:0%
blatantly false what we're doing right
 
06:39:53.070 --> 06:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
now currently on a national level we
 
06:39:54.388 --> 06:39:54.398 align:start position:0%
we're involved very close with the
 
06:39:56.430 --> 06:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
national Funeral Directors Association
 
06:39:58.868 --> 06:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
as are all of the other State uh funeral
 
06:40:01.030 --> 06:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
direct funeral associations we've been
 
06:40:03.628 --> 06:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
working on this bill uh and I'll just
 
06:40:05.190 --> 06:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
read it just I won't read the bill but
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill and I will send
 
06:40:08.590 --> 06:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
you this give this information in my
 
06:40:10.110 --> 06:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
testimony here which I have a copy for
 
06:40:12.110 --> 06:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
each of you uh it's both in the Senate
 
06:40:14.628 --> 06:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
and the house and this is the uh
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
consensual donation and research
 
06:40:19.350 --> 06:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
Integrity Act of 2023 this is the third
 
06:40:20.788 --> 06:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
Congress that we've introduced this
 
06:40:22.750 --> 06:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
we're gaining traction it's getting more
 
06:40:25.270 --> 06:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
appeal uh most of the times when I meet
 
06:40:26.910 --> 06:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
our members here in New Hampshire are
 
06:40:28.670 --> 06:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
all supporting this in both of their
 
06:40:33.030 --> 06:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
houses um and of course uh we will be
 
06:40:35.430 --> 06:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
able to monitor that under uh Federal
 
06:40:36.910 --> 06:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
Regulations particularly when it comes
 
06:40:39.070 --> 06:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
to interstate commerce that's the one
 
06:40:41.150 --> 06:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
place that they can do it and so we've
 
06:40:42.948 --> 06:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
got to find a way to Reign this in there
 
06:40:44.788 --> 06:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
are people who are totally unscrupulous
 
06:40:46.628 --> 06:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that that's the case
 
06:40:49.270 --> 06:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
here but there's that possibility we
 
06:40:50.948 --> 06:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
open it up and it's the kind of thing
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
that keeps me awake at night because you
 
06:40:54.590 --> 06:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
know we deal with the families who are
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with these people in
 
06:40:57.868 --> 06:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
these situations when things don't work
 
06:41:00.948 --> 06:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
out and I respect what the the uh
 
06:41:03.150 --> 06:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative from the Oregon Bank made
 
06:41:05.350 --> 06:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh about the idea of indiv individuals
 
06:41:07.628 --> 06:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps being coerced we're concerned
 
06:41:09.190 --> 06:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
about the
 
06:41:12.230 --> 06:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
deceased uh their their human remains
 
06:41:14.230 --> 06:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
because this bill doesn't specify is it
 
06:41:16.830 --> 06:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
the living or the or the dead and who
 
06:41:19.468 --> 06:41:19.478 align:start position:0%
sells these parts and families nowadays
 
06:41:21.830 --> 06:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know if they felt they could I'm not
 
06:41:23.388 --> 06:41:23.398 align:start position:0%
saying they're all like this but there
 
06:41:25.388 --> 06:41:25.398 align:start position:0%
are those who could just see the dollar
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
value in their loved one what they might
 
06:41:29.910 --> 06:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
be able to get if they could sell uh
 
06:41:31.948 --> 06:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
sell body parts could start wrapping up
 
06:41:33.910 --> 06:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir I uh I'll bring I'll close it
 
06:41:36.270 --> 06:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
right up now and of course Rec more
 
06:41:39.510 --> 06:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
recently um we just had last year uh
 
06:41:41.868 --> 06:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
very close to home the instance with the
 
06:41:44.150 --> 06:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
Harvard Medical School there morg uh
 
06:41:46.590 --> 06:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
there morg and the operat the manager of
 
06:41:48.510 --> 06:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
there morg uh had been selling body
 
06:41:51.708 --> 06:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
parts around the country uh it was found
 
06:41:53.388 --> 06:41:53.398 align:start position:0%
out that this happened least involved
 
06:41:55.190 --> 06:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
eight anyway I think this been going for
 
06:41:59.230 --> 06:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
much longer uh the courts just um
 
06:42:01.830 --> 06:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
dismissed the civil cases against
 
06:42:04.270 --> 06:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
Harvard and and their other people this
 
06:42:05.948 --> 06:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
individual is still under Federal
 
06:42:08.350 --> 06:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
indictment uh again under the interstate
 
06:42:10.030 --> 06:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
commerce part because he was selling
 
06:42:12.310 --> 06:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
them across state lines uh this
 
06:42:15.230 --> 06:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
gentleman unfortunately for us was a was
 
06:42:17.788 --> 06:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
is a resident of New Hampshire and so
 
06:42:19.310 --> 06:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know we we that's not how we want to
 
06:42:22.030 --> 06:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
make the national news and uh but he is
 
06:42:23.750 --> 06:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
still under under uh invest
 
06:42:25.270 --> 06:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
investigation he's still being tried for
 
06:42:27.628 --> 06:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
that so so this this problem is closer
 
06:42:28.868 --> 06:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
to home but I just think we need to
 
06:42:30.670 --> 06:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
regulate this and make sure there's a
 
06:42:32.310 --> 06:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more work that needs to go
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
into this if we're going to do this and
 
06:42:36.830 --> 06:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
I have to I have to uh you know
 
06:42:40.030 --> 06:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
certainly uh bow to to the medical uh
 
06:42:41.910 --> 06:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
