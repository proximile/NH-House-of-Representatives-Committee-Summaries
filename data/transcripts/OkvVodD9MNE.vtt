introduce the bill I believe that would
be

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman my
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
name is John gr I represent the town of
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
Bedford which is Hillsboro district 7 I
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
bring before you a bill to participate
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
in a public private partnership with two
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
railroad Railways in the state of New
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um this is not a new project
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
or situation for us in the past we have
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
heard similar bills to um partnership
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
and a 5050 bases with the railroads in
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
order to maintain their Capital which is
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
ties and rails um on these things the
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
reason that I support this is because
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
one it keeps uh rail TR traff moving
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
through the state some of which goes out
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
to Midwest and further south the other
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
reason is it keeps a lot of trucks heavy
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
trucks off the roads here in New
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is better that we use great
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
Railways rather than having some of
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
these larger trucks up and down our
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
highways on a daily basis um I would ask
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
that we probably consider doing what we
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
have done the last two terms when we
 
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
exec this bill which is to retain the
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
bill and then see if we can work it into
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
the capital budget which we will get
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
next month it will probably not be at
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that is in the bill
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
last term that we asked for two million
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
it was well less than a million each
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
that they got um so it depends on our
 
00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:23.790 align:start position:0%
that they got um so it depends on our
fiscal

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
ability whether we included and then
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
what amount in the capital budget if we
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
were to retain with that Mr chairman I
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
am willing to take questions but it's
 
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.869 align:start position:0%
am willing to take questions but it's
pretty

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
straightforward um thank you

here for over 150 years but what we have
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
done in the last several years is
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
partner with as a state with St Lawrence
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
in Atlantic dollar for dooll
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
on a project to upgrade and modernize
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
the track so that heavier rail cars that
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
could carry more weight can now run uh
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
from Montreal to Maine and through the
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
northern part of New Hampshire
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
happily just at the moment Coos appears
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
to be having some good fortune on uh
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
major projects gorm pap
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
has become White Mountain paper and is
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
going to expand bring in another paper
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
machine and that is a customer that
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
could be here milin Lumber has just
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
announced a $12 million expansion that's
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
um someone who might ship on this rail
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
line so not only will we have uh rail
 
00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.949 align:start position:0%
line so not only will we have uh rail
cars

00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
cars
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
and locomotives going through Coos
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
County but we have the potential to be
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
shipping from this place not only
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
shipping out but
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
importing Goods to be manufactured or
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
processed in these plants that are
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
expanding so I am Keen to see whether we
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
could get enough Capital to finish the
 
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.750 align:start position:0%
could get enough Capital to finish the
project

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh which has been going for close to 10
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
years now and uh so this is a
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental infrastructure project that
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
will bring economic uh good to Coos
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
which I might say needs it badly uh
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
we've been hard hit by the pandemic as
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
so much of New Hampshire has uh but we
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
didn't start out at the at the top of
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
the Heap and and so this project is very
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
important for uh Coos County I'd be
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
happy to I submitted some written
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank thank you representative
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear things are looking
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
better in your area are there any
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
Tucker seeing none thank you thank you

Mr chairman my name is Paul wwit I'm
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
here today uh representing the St
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Atlantic railroad I'm employed
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
by Gallagher cahan and got Trail in
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
coner New
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um again we this rail line
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
goes from gor gorm to Berlin to up to
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
North straford the um this project
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
really started back in
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
2010 when the capital budget Committee
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
in the in the house allocated $850,000
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
to be spent in rehabil heading the rail
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh since then in
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
201 uh 16 fiscally year
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
201617 the capital budget uh committee
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
allocated a 1.5 million but mandated
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
that it had to be matched dollar for
 
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
dollar and that bill passed and we
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
matched it dollar for
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
dollar so that um for the last two years
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
the the next two years uh it was
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
appropriated $1 million by the capital
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
budget of the House and Senate and
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
$900,000 in in in last fiscal year last
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
capital budget so it's been
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
appropriately approximately $6.8 million
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
has been authorized to rehabilitate this
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
line and we're getting it to the finish
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
of 3.4 from the private sector and 3.4
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
from the state but it's important to
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
note that this project is under the
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
supervision of the Department of
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation rail division U they
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
Agreements are assigned
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
and go to governor and councel for
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
approval what's important in those
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
agreements among other things is that
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
the state maintains a lean on the
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
property for 10 years and also in the
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
agreement we are required to maintain
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
the rail to the status that we were
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
upgraded to in this case we're get
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
upgrading it to class two Rail and that
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
um means 25 miles hour for freight
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
trains and the um so we have to maintain
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
it that again as representative trer
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
said we've had some new companies coming
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
in uh I believe it's because of seeing
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
the investment in the area by the state
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
and and the railroad and we've been
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
working closely with um uh the u
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
bino u to and to attract business to the
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh to this to this
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
area and we've also um Canadian Council
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
and we've been very active in trying to
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
recruit companies to located in this
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
area so with the allocation if this
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
money was to go through it would
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
complete the project uh to the finish
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
and with that uh I have Charles Hunter
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
because he sent a package he was from
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
the St Lawrence Atlantic railroad I
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if he was able to get in but
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
he would be able to further explain the
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
operational side of it and with that I
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
will um
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
um glad to answer any questions Mr chair
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there are there
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
questions yes pleas thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:11.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
who determines that the matching funds
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the railroad are
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
exact unfortunately I didn't hear compl
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
questions what I was trying to know if
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's my
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
up yeah um who
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
determined uh that the railroad spent
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
exactly the Max Fund what was received
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
state that's a good qu question
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative that's why the Department
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
of Transportation supervises it and and
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
we have a full accounting of of our
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
money and the state's money and in fact
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring up that in the capital
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
budgets and it's not in the bill uh but
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
the capital budget oversight committee
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
gets a report every uh every six months
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
of what money has been spent so that the
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget oversight committee gets
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at did the state how
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
much the state paid and how much the
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
railroad paid it's all accounted
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
for question and I would be glad to show
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
you show you the last last uh fiscal
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
last meeting of the capital budget
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
committee and the documents that we that
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
were submitted by the St Lawrence
 
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.949 align:start position:0%
were submitted by the St Lawrence
Atlantic

00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
Atlantic
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
pleas did I understand you correctly
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
saying that this if this deal passes and
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
is fully funded that it would finish the
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
rebuilding of the line
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative that is that this fully
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
funding this would complete the
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
refurbishing of the line uh to um to the
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
Vermont to through nor Trafford again
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
this rail has been here probably I'm
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
told 80 years again we sent a packet if
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
you I think you can see the old Rail and
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
the new rail but it's been there since
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
at least 80 maybe 90
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah m is Charles Hunter available

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
committee good morning everybody uh
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for having us Paul you did a
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
great summary of our project one thing I
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
would like to add on how the project is
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
funded St Lawrence and Atlantic railroad
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
actually pays for everything up front so
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
we in coordination with New Hampshire DT
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
we put out an RFP to order the materials
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
and award the Construction contract and
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
then we actually pay for everything UPF
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
front and then we're we are um
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
submitting for reimbursement with Dot
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
and they reimburse us the 50 cents on
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
the dollar uh any cost overrun are on
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
the St Lawrence and Atlantic railroad
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
we've done a really good job on these
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
other projects and managing these and
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
getting them in um on or under budget
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
and uh I really can't stress enough that
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
this is the last link it's really the
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
missing link to complete this uh project
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
I've been around this railroad since
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
1995 um we've done a lot of work in
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
Maine um up in Quebec to get this line
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um completed so this this is really
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%

attorney and lobbyist for the New
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire North Coast railroad which I

who I represented for 34 years always a
 
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
pleasure to virtually even virtually
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
appear before uh my old committee um uh
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in favor of HP
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
1222a first thing I want to do is
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
Express the Gratitude of the New
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire North Coast each of the last
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
two Capital budgets 2017
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
2019 uh the state of appropriated
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
$900,000 in each of those budgets to be
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
matched um by the railroad those
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
projects were completed the following
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
year uh 2018 and 20 the 2020 U project
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
was was completed in December on time on
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
schedule in spite of covid uh it's made
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
a huge
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
difference and and I can't stress enough
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
there are 603 Shortline railroads in the
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh United States I remember that because
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
of the number um 603 but there there's
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
class three and um there dozens of class
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
one and class two railroads which are
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
the bigger ones the main lines these all
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
exist these these railroads only exist
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
because of the private Public
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
Partnerships between the federal and
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
state governments and and these rail
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
roads um the infrastructure costs are
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
just tremendous and to keep it uh keep
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
the trains rolling it it requires u a
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative effort I I presented uh to
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation which I'm not
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to go through but it's it's
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory I'll just hit a few
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
highlights uh the North Coast railroad
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
is a 42 M Shortline railroad that runs
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
between um Rollinsford and goes up
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
through summersworth Rochester Leb and
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
Maine it cuts through for about a
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
quarter mile Milton Wakefield and up to
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
oopy it's part of the old Conway Branch
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
we've been hauling Freight for more than
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
150 years uh the main the main um
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
Freight is concrete sand that goes about
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
two thirds of it goes to to Boston
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
another third goes to Rochester propane
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
is the main thing that comes in goes to
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
Eastern Propane at their facility and we
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
do a lot of we run some steel too out of
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
out of Maine it goes to O is offloaded
 
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
and trucked over to Maine the um there's
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
a picture in the PowerPoint presentation
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
of of the transloading facility that
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
Services the the sand on the left and
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
the propane on the right um as has been
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
discussed you know one of the main
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
benefits of of shortland railroads
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
Freight railroads is they uh is they
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
take they dramatically increase fuel
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency decrease carbon emissions uh
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
because they take heavy truck trips off
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
the highways um New Hampshire's current
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
Freight volume eliminates 37,000 heavy
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
tractor trailer or tanker trips each
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
year um it has a and and that and that
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
just improves safety fuel efficiency but
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
really has a huge impact on uh on
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the roads taking that all
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
that that heavy traffic off the roads uh
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
helps helps extend their life and
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
reduces the maintenance costs of the
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
roads um nhn spends uh 350,000 to a
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year and and like
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
the St Lawrence in Atlantic we've had an
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing Capital project which just got a
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
big shot in the arm this past this past
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
year uh in the sense that we uh we
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
applied for a in the past we've had
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
tiger grants which open up the north of
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
the line but we just got approved last
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
October for a Federal grant which
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
allowed for 100 um I'm sorry $4.5
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
million in federal money we still
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
haven't signed the grant yet but we're
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
working on that um that's going to be a
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
four-year project and it it requires $2
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
million in matching funds from the North
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
Coast we're also getting $100,000 in
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
matching money from the U from a
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
contribution from the largest customer
 
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.830 align:start position:0%
contribution from the largest customer
Eastern

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
Eastern
 
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.669 align:start position:0%
Eastern
Propane

00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
Propane
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
um but we still have an an issue that we
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
have not addressed and while we we'd be
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
looking at probably significantly less
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
money than is in the bill we we need to
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
start addressing the Urgent concern we
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
have over our our bridges our biggest
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
our biggest and most dangerous problem
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
is is was a Haven Hill bridge and I show
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
in the pictures if you saw it uh this
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
thing has had so many accidents 11 feet
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
tall even the sign is is is damaged from
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
trucks hitting it uh in the photos I
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
show you there's it shows the the bridge
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
and it's uh and on the right hand side
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can see a truck that went through it
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
and it was demolished no one was hurt
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
thankfully but the truck was demolished
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the bridge was hit you know that
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of catastrophic accident
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
that could shut down the bridge and
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
obviously cause uh damage to to to uh
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
property and life uh we have a bunch of
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
other Bridges I show show the bridges
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
and show some of the issues um
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
you know what we're looking for in this
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget round because of our
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
financial constraints both from the
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
tiger Grant uh and our budget
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance cycle you can only do so
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
much in a year what we're asking for is
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
um going be a significant lesser amount
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
but we would start to like addressing of
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
these Bridge issues over the next uh uh
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
15 years uh there's 33 bridges on the on
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
the nhn line 24 of them are owned by the
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
nhn and uh we are hopeful that we could
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
ask this uh this committee and through
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
the capital budget cycle to uh to make
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of modest U contribution to
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
our be beginning a a real big project
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
which is taking care of the bridges that
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
Haven Hill bridge by the way is taken
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
care of in the tiger Grant but it's the
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
only I mean in the the Chrissy Grant but
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's the only it's the only U Bridge
 
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's being addressed we do have
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
yearly reports the the railroad is safe
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
but if if we don't address these ongoing
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues deferred maintenance
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
issues uh we'll have problems in the
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%

00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
get a copy of that will be file the enre
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
report but will all
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
members they got invol yeah may I
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
suggest it's it's a long report and we
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
all get a lot of stuff as legislators I
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
would suggest just if you very least
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
just read the uh executive summary I
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
think it' be helpful is to the
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
background on this so but anyway um um
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
thank you all thank you Mr chair and
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions but I think Justice
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
Marcone is signed up I would suggest
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
that you hear from her next but you call
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
obviously but I'll take a question or
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
two but I think Justice Marone will do a
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
better job answering it than I will any
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
for

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative see
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony thank
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair chair would like to call on
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee um when I was appointed
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
to the court in
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
2017 shortly after my arrival I became
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
the library judge and the Li Library
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
judge is the liaison to the king Law
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
Library which is the only Public Law
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
Library in the state it is a state
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
facility if you will our building the
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Building at Charles do
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
Drive is um under the offices of
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the New
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Law Library while we oversee
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
it is its own sort of Standalone um
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
facility providing um legal resources to
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
the public um my second surprise was
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
down in the basement of the building
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
since it was built 50 years ago and I
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
don't know where the records were before
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
that but we have these casebooks
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
starting in
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
1849 coming forward to
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
1977 after
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
1977 case files were kept in a more
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
traditional filing manner but these case
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
books what they used to do in the olden
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
days was and particularly as the Supreme
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
Court Justices Road circuit even they
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
would take the notes of the judge the
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
exhibits the Deeds whatever was provided
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the case the lawyer pleadings stitch
 
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
them into books and that was their
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
method of preservation so these books
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
are fascinating but they contain um
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
different types of Old Paper different
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
types of inks they're very archival in
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
what is there some contain writings of
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
famous figures some not so famous and um
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
they sit on shelves in our basement
 
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.710 align:start position:0%
they sit on shelves in our basement
which

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
is nicely secure and dry so far but
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
these are not being preserved in any
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
type of um archival manner plus they are
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
not as accessible to the public for
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
example Mary Baker Eddie there was some
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
recent litigation
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers came to research some prior
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
litigation in the 1800s and with white
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
gloves they're you know pulling through
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
these documents because they're not
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
online they're not accessible so in
 
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.950 align:start position:0%
online they're not accessible so in
actually

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
2018 uh Mary sur's our librarian and I
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
think she's teed up to testify also had
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
the um Northeast documents Center do a
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
review of these books and that's the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
report that you have and when you look
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
at page 20 9 it breaks the um books into
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
three segments the oldest being the most
 
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
fragile and the most in need of
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
attention at this point in time and then
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
obviously the second set a little bit
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
different the third set more current and
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
in need of less immediate attention so
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
my um Quest was to start this process
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
and it can be done a book at a time um
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
to get the books digitized that will
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
involve disbonding them digitizing the
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
record so that it is online searchable
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to um access the
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
record and then preserving the artifact
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
because again some of these are
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
historical documents that we don't want
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
to destroy at the same time we need to
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
retrofit space in the basement climate
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
controlled so that it can um house the
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
um the the uh preserved records so it's
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
a big project the digitizing and the
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
preservation is the $2 million and my
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
goal and with uh representative of
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
ramy's help is to get it started I've
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
been in touch with ran berford at the
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire archives they can store
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
but they can't they don't have the
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to um preserve I've been in
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
touch with the New Hampshire um
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
Historical Society they are aware and
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
face similar challenges with their old
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
documents I've spoken with commissioner
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
Arling house and also
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
um uh Mary sherles has been in touch
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire library so um
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
we've got all the folks in the
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
Historical Library business aware of
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
this project and we've been able to draw
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
from them um some of their
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
experience that being said the
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
renovation of the building would be some
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
that would fall in the court um capital
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
budget process but in terms
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
of Court's capital budget is kind of
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
like the highway plan it's a
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
longstanding prioritization of building
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
and Facilities um needs in the court
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
buildings that some are owned by the
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
judicial branch some by the state but
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
this project is not intended to
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
interfere with that
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
longstanding um prioritization of Court
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
facilities so this is a bit as
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative abramy said neither fish
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
nor foul because we straddle um sort of
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
two different branches of government um
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
I did also meet with the joint
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislative historical committee last
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
spring before Co shut things down and
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
they were supportive of this project as
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
it dovetailed with some of the documents
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
that were discovered in the state house
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
renovation so um and they were the ones
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
that suggested a capital appropriation
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of how we got here today
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
to you so I am happy to answer questions
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
um again the process here is to get this
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
project off the ground so that we can
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
start preserving the um most fragile and
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
justice questions
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
representa thank you thank you P Justice
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um can you give
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
me some feel uh I have not read to your
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
report U what number of documents 1849
 
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.190 align:start position:0%
report U what number of documents 1849
through

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
1977 not to the number but is it
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of documents or is it hundreds
 
00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:25.349 align:start position:0%
thousands of documents or is it hundreds
of

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
documents I'll just
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
group one is 167 volumes so that is 1849
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
1890s each volume and I've been giving
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
tours so anyone who wants to come over
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
and see these things they're fascinating
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
at least to me who likes old things um
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
each volume has couple hundred pages of
 
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
stitched in documents and some of those
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
documents are odd sizes they get folded
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
in so um there
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
are 167 volumes in group one
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
253 volumes in group two
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
213 volumes in group three and again
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
each volume has um a number of pages in
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
and if you turn when you get a chance to
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
group The entitle the entire um project
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
is approximately
 
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:37.790 align:start position:0%
is approximately
620,000

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
620,000
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
Pages at
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
page thank thank you if I could so I
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
understand the digit dig digitizing the
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
documents I understand that process did
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
I did I hear or did I miss that the
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
archiving part of that for now is making
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
the room um more uh acceptable for
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
documents going forward are you actually
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to look then uh then to do
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
something to the pro to the documents to
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
reserve them better the project um the
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
room is I will say the third um part
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
that is the actual building renovation
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
is a third aspect that I'm looking
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um for funding the
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
the restoration and digitization project
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
has two parts so the
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
62,000 Pages at 175 is the
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
digitization and that's about a million
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
the preparation treating and
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
rehousing of the documents so that's the
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
archival part that's an additional
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
million so the 2 million involves both
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
the restoration and preservation
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
digitization thank thank you for your
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
time y any other questions
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative good morning Madam
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
Justice what where are the U where and
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
how are the documents going to be stored
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the interim if the building project
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
ends up being the last part of
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
this um currently they are they the
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
documents are on shelves in an area of
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
the B basement that is not the same as
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
the room that would be um renovated and
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping and of course the I believe
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
the um documents will be going offsite
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
to Northeast document uh Conservation
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
Center so a we can renovate the space
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
which is not the same space they're in
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
currently while they sit where they are
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
the other point is some of them will be
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
going off site to be
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
preserved and will they
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
restore sorry will they store them while
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
the construction's going on if there had
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
to be storage I think yes um again
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
the and I should and I can send over a
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
map of the Supreme Court basement which
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
I have but where they are now is not
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
where the construction would be
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
happening so they could stay where they
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
are where they've been luckily safe for
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
50 years um no leaks um while the
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
construction's going on in another part
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
basement thank you very much any further
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions I see no hands raised from
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
our members who are attending
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
yourself hello hi you're you're good if
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
you could identify yourself yes I'm John
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
Lewis uh let me start my video so you
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
can see me I uh I'm a retied superior
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
court judge and uh after I retired one
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that I embarked to do was
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
to write a law review article about the
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
Claremont cases and so I proceeded to
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
try to find out where the pertinent
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
records were uh for that that case which
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
is a historical case extremely important
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it's actually relatively recent
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh the major decisions that I was
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
focused on were in
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
1993 and
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
1997 and uh I found that when I went to
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court I went down to that
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful basement that Justice Hans mon
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
Corney just talked to you about and
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
found some records there uh to be able
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
to work with but to my shock found that
 
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
many records were not available and in
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
fact the marac Superior Court couldn't
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
even find their
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
records uh finally after a lot of uh
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
constructive squeaky realism on my part
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
and others uh we did find them somewhere
 
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh and were able to put them together in
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of sensible way and I was able
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
to finish my law review article uh which
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
is one example of how sometimes when you
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
write when you have the records to look
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
at you can really make a an impact on a
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
historical understanding uh of important
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
cases which remain uh important uh in
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
terms of our current uh issues and
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
problems so that's that got me involved
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
in wondering just what are we doing with
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
regard to our records and I I have been
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
in discussions with uh the Supreme Court
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
and just and Justice Hans Marone who's
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
been wonderful in in this in this effort
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
uh to try to get us more sensitive to
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
this and I'm I am a member of the New
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
society and uh the bar is also
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
interested in this uh and I'm a member
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
of a committee on the New Hampshire
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court society called the
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
judicial case history preservation
 
00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:57.349 align:start position:0%
judicial case history preservation
committee

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of uh
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh surveying the bar to try to
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
identify uh the most
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
importanta cases in New Hampshire
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
history that have impacted on our jurist
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
prudence and we're going to be providing
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
a report to Justice Hans Marone about
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
that so as she does her work uh will be
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
able to highlight and focus on uh those
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
important cases we have have a whole
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
slew of historically important cases
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
throughout our history going back to the
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College case and all sorts of
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
cases afterwards so um I I really
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
support this effort I think it's well if
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
you went down to the B the basement of
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Courts you
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
would see uh that they do the best they
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
can but the records are
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
not wellmaintained
 
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we're I'm only talking about
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
1993 I really think digital Tas digital
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
tasing of of these records is extremely
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
important and not just from a historical
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
point of view uh because many of these
 
00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:21.559 align:start position:0%
cases uh rear their heads uh for your
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
consideration as well and for your
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of them and they're not
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
simple the CL on cases a perfect example
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh so I urge you to support this
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
bill I'm really pleased that it's being
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
done on a peac meal basis uh I really uh
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
applaud Justice Hans Mor conone for her
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
efforts here and I I hope you will

me thank you are there any questions
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
from members of the
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
committee to Mr leis
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
if not I just have if they be rhetorical
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Lewis as you surveyed the bar if you
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
ask them if they help to fund this
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
effort or
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
not I I didn't quite hear that could you
 
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.230 align:start position:0%
not I I didn't quite hear that could you
repeat

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
that I I said as you surveying the bar
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
have you roached any members of the bar
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
about helping to fund this preservation
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
effort uh I H I have not yet done that
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're we're up a stage in fact we're
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to be meeting later today where
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're sending out a email to three or
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
four selected bar people in in various
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
areas of law in which we're going to ask
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
them uh to identify in their areas of
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
law uh five to 10 cases that they think
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
are really
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
impactful and in the course of writing
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
that email we're going to be sensitizing
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
them as well the Justice H to this bill
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
that you're considering and I just know
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
from the reception we got in the New
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court society when we
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
started discussing this that that
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
Society is made up of many very uh
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
experienced and competent and good
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers uh and judges and all of them
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
were extremely supportive of this effort
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'll just tell you I sat for a good
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
deal of time in straford county and and
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
they used to have their records very
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
much like uh just as Hans Maroney uh
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
described the Supreme Court Records in
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
these little binders uh and there were
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
occasions in my 12 years as a judge
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
where I had to go back to look at an old
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
case and sometimes even to the 1850s and
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
60s and boy oh boy did I have to be
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
careful when I open these binders that
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
the records wouldn't just disintegrate
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
in my hand
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh as I was dealing with them and these
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
required what's before us on the Supreme
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
Court Records please we have there are
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
only three people to sign up I have
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
much any other questions I see
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
none if we could promote commissioner
 
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
none if we could promote commissioner
Arling

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
Arling
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
so he can
 
00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:30.870 align:start position:0%
so he can
speak

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.079 --> 00:53:37.589 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner hi can you hear me we can
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
hear you oh perfect uh this is Charlie
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
Arling housee I'm the commissioner of
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
administrative services and it's my
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
pleasure to join you this morning
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
following your distinguished panels um I
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
would say oh somebody wants me to start
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
my video hang on
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
typically people don't want to see me
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they're happy not to but here I am
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
um I was going to say something uh
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
profound and I've now forgotten it um oh
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
I would say this I would think the
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has done an excellent job
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
taking has done a better job taking care
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
of the records in their basement than I
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
would have in mine but I'm not sure
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's the standard that we're
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
particularly looking for but um um they
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
should probably preserve records we
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
should give them the ability to preserve
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
records in a way that is superior to my
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
ability to preserve creamed corn um just
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
a thought um why is this happening this
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
way is a key question I I want to make
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
sure you don't think that we don't
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
support the project or think it's a good
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
idea at all um uh I was over and and uh
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
justice Marcone gave me a tour of the
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
basement which I was very interesting
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
and the documents are um Court
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
facilities enter the capital budget
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
typically um or always I guess as a
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
result of the deliberations of a court
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
accreditation committee which some of
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
your members have been on I'm pointing
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
but you can't see who I'm pointing at um
 
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.230 align:start position:0%
but you can't see who I'm pointing at um
but

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
um they uh debate the terms of the
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
building and then our capital budget
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
requests through administrative services
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
and our Bureau of Court facilities ay
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
administered by um the excellent Sarah
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
Lineberry as most of you know um puts
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
those requests together this isn't that
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court record are not part of
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
the um operational standard of Court
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
facilities um as determined by a
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive fully constituted
 
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee it's a separate thing doesn't
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
make it a bad idea makes it it's
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually I think it's a really good idea
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
um they're terrific records that we're
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
that are in danger of one bad snowstorm
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
or a state building leaking which
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
occasionally happens you may know um uh
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
away but it's presented this way um we
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
are agnostic at administrative services
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
on whether it's part of the capital
 
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
budget or Standalone legislation I think
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is a perfectly reasonable approach
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
but um you may decide to to merge it um
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
I would just say I think it's an
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
important project and and we're very
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of Justice marone's efforts
 
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.630 align:start position:0%
supportive of Justice marone's efforts
on

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
it and will no doubt help thank you
 
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
have I have one that is just procedural
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
do you know commissioner since your
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
department works closely with the
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
governor's office on developing the
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget that he will present to
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
us whether or not this project has been
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
presented to the governor as part of
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
that discussion it it it was not the
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
capital budget hearings were in July
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
virtually very much like this as you
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
might recall um and it was I don't think
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't think it was actually fully
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
formed at that time and so this is not
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
not something that I think he's been
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
looking at I don't know if his people
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
know otherwise but um I suspect that
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
request okay thank you any other
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
either here or virtually seeing none
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner thank you for
 
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.630 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner thank you for
having

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.910 align:start position:0%
having
me

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
recognize Miss C if you
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
yourself can you hear
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm sorry I don't have a micro
 
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.190 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm sorry I don't have a micro
uh

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
video um yes I'm the register of deeds
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
at the marrat County registry of
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
deeds and we have subject our records to
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
uh such a process it was costly it took
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
a long time um fortunately we have a
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
budget for that but what I wanted to
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
talk about was um
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
email and um if you don't have it in
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
it or let me summarize it um summarize
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
please okay
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
the where the historic record the court
 
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
record is in my opinion as a keep of
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
land records um where it's most
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
important is in the area of um research
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
and litigation involving land ownership
 
00:59:08.359 --> 00:59:09.190 align:start position:0%
and litigation involving land ownership
and

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
usage um for three reasons
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
um first of
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
all land records
 
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
are they go back quite a bit in time so
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
for instance someone could have granted
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
an easement in
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
perpetuity 100 200 years ago
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
and we our office does not always have
 
00:59:36.359 --> 00:59:37.430 align:start position:0%
and we our office does not always have
those

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
records we have what only whatever
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
records have been filed by by someone by
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
a person um and then we keep that we are
 
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
a registry we are not um an official
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
source so when people do um title
 
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.789 align:start position:0%
source so when people do um title
searches

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
searches
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh prepare for litigation about land
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
they are more likely to go back very far
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
um to the first
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
um to to
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
the the first known ownership or
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
instance where um the problem occurred
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is that land
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
ownership devolves from common
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
law it is less a sub process of
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislation than other forms of Law and
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
so every time there's a case that has to
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
do with land that becomes part of the um
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
that becomes part of the law because
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
such cases provide
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
precedence to other
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
cases and then the last thing is that
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
right now um um
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
research has been made more
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
difficult so for instance a someone who
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
wants to develop a large tract of land
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
may need to do a lot of
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
research and we are we will be their
 
01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
first source of um of
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
review but when there are challenges
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
they will have to go back not only to
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
our records but to the court records and
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
some of these may be old now all of our
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
records are
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
online going back to our first in the
 
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.349 align:start position:0%
online going back to our first in the
mid

01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
mid
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
1800s and we've
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
done a pretty good job
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
um but we have a much smaller body of
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
Records um and we have a funding source
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
for them too and every year when we go
 
01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
for them too and every year when we go
our

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
budget the
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
um the legislative committee if we could
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
keep it on the court records and not
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
your own I would appreciate
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
it sorry I can't hear you I I said if
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
you could keep your testimony directed
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
at the court records and not your own uh
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
County records would be appreciated okay
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
um well um
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you very much um and I
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
also for the for everybody's edification
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
I think all the members of the committee
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
got it we received a similar uh
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from Kelly Monahan who is
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire registers
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
of deeds in full support of HB
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
595 for the same reasons that Miss rean
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
um just outlined
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.029 align:start position:0%
there any questions
for

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
the may I add one
 
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
the may I add one
thing

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
um I had received word from Coos County
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
um that they were going to testify about
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
how important it was that records be
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
available um online as you know Coos
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
County is um somewhat isolated it to the
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
court records it would be
 
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.950 align:start position:0%
court records it would be
appreciated

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's it thank you
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
yep there are two more hands raised and
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
I would ask that when we call upon you
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
if it is new testimony it would be
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated but try to limit um
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
repetition from what has already been
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
said by either Justice Marone or the
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
others who have testified first one up
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
right welcome to Public Works and
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
highways miss
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
and good morning can you hear me we've
 
01:04:19.559 --> 01:04:20.910 align:start position:0%
and good morning can you hear me we've
got

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
yet my name is Mary surles I'm the law
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
librarian at the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
Court and uh I'm doing I swear I will be
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
brief I will add just one thing I wanted
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
to emphasize the scope of these records
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
and of the various uses that um they are
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
they are used by used for um these
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
records include not only cases that have
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
published opinions but also any case
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
that was filed at the super Court the
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
briefs the pleadings correspondence
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes from the judges and there are
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
no other records of these these cases
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
that did not result in published
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
opinions so these are very unique and
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
valuable records that we have the other
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to emphasize is the scope
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the uses genealogists use these
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
records to research family history we've
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
had law schools ask for copies of these
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
older records um just as Hance Marone
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned the current litigation but we
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
also um have had we also have a
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
researcher who is writing a history of
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
the mount Cog Railway and is looking at
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
the litigation that was involved with
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
that so these are go far beyond just a
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
history of the court system or just the
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
legal profession but speak to the
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
history of New Hampshire and her
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
citizens that's all I have thank you
 
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.670 align:start position:0%
citizens that's all I have thank you

that are either in the room or attending
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
and um also off of the straford uh the
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
spaling Turnpike exit 6 is my exit um I
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
go this is not the New Jersey
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
legislature anyway
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
hb35 well it's an exact repeat of HB
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
1363 which uh was assigned to the
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
transportation committee rather than the
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
Public Works committee if I call
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
correctly and actually um passed
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously was passed on a
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
Voice vote in the Full House and then it
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh this was uh this is in late February
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then in March he sent it to the
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
Senate and for what and for um as we all
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
know things were kind of disrupted back
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
then and this is one of the bills that
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
got uh lost in the shuffle and the
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
Senate tabled it but it's
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh it deals with pretty simple bill it
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
just simplifies the existing law
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
relating to those um blue signs which
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
appear short ly for limited access
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
Highway exits which say things like
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
attractions Exit 32 so and um the state
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
owns those signs of course but uh and
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
The Operators of attractions and uh
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
motorist services pay yearly fees to
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
have their businesses advertised on the
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
signs and um just a couple of years ago
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
we uh contracted with a business which
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh administers the program for the state
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
the signs are not particularly Well's
 
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
the signs are not particularly Well's
not

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
inexpensive but it's it's it's uh very
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
beneficial for both uh businesses and
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
the motorists um and the program cost to
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
State nothing in fact I think it
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
actually makes a small profit um and um
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
I know you send me an email asking me I
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
sent a page of written testimony there's
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
like long history behind this but um and
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
I want to any I left a lot of the
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
history out but basically right now
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
under existing law there's restrictions
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
on how many signs be erected north of
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
conquer on IED 9 or i93 as opposed from
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts border to conquered um
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
so right now south of conquer the do and
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and contractor I guess put up as many
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
additional motorist services and
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
traction signs as they please if there's
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
a demand for more signs
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
um north of conquer we can do additional
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
traction signs can be W if needed but
 
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
only one set of motorist services signs
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
allowed even if there's demand for more
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
signs and uh well first of all the teach
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
north of south of conquer that sounds
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
simple but actually causes a lot of
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount of confusion in my part
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
of the state we have the Spalding
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
Turnpike which at the
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
33 mile limited north south limit
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
accessa which doesn't go particularly
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
near Massachusetts it's 12 miles from
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
the border and it goes up to to Milton
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
um so it's really unclear where in the
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
Spalding turnpike north of conquer is
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
there is a conquer is a control City on
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
the exit from my exit exit 6 but um
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
actually conquered it conquered is due
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
west of the over so um so anyways this
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
is a this is just a very simple bill
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's a pro pro business and PR motorist
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill because um as I said they um
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
motorists like these signs because they
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
can see what's visible what's going to
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
be available at the next exit and the
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
businesses like it because it it drives
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
more business to the state and also um
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
businesses especially benefit from it
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
are state liquor stores which contribute
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to the state coffers and
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
then also uh and also gas stations and
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh restaurants also pay a lot of taxes
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
to the state so um I think I think um I
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
think we should uh finish what we
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
started uh started last year pass it to
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
um the committee this was Transportation
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
last time but it's in your committee
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
this time and um send it off you know
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
send it on its way and um I hope uh Hing
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
hope we get this uh passed and signed by
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
the governor pretty soon so that's
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's um that's my testimony I'd be
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
happy to take any question questions so
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
there may be others who can speak more
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the technical details of it are there
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%

hry okay thank you um thank you Mr
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and members of the committee
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh for the record uh my name is Henry
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
veu and I'm here on behalf of the New
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
Association um our association uh
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
supports this bill uh we were involved
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh when this original
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
statute uh was created I don't know a
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
dozen years or so ago um and uh there
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
was some concern among folks about uh um
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
logos on the on the signs uh north of
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
conquered and the grand bargain back
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
then was all right let's let's do it uh
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
conquered South uh so this bill here
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
basically just strikes out the language
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
of the prohibition of the Lo goes on the
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
main line of the highway um so they're
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
they're on the they're as as you get off
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
the exits uh on the main
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
lines um up north um you can see the
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
logos uh you know the Common Man or
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it is uh you know restaurant at
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the exit ramp you'll
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
see them uh but those logos are
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
prohibited on the on the mainline of the
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
highway so a mile before the exit uh and
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
of course they're limited uh to uh those
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants and lodging properties that
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
are located near the exit so this is not
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
for restaurant that's several miles down
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
the road the purpose of them obviously
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
is uh uh motorist Service uh to let them
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
know uh that there is something at the
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
exit so um I'll I'll stop there uh just
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to let the uh committee know that
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
the restaurant Lodging Association does
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%

01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation I did s
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
submit um testimony a written testimony
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
I hope you all were able to get that
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
it's essentially just a a brief overview
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
or background of of the um specific
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
service sign uh signing program as it's
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
called by the um manual and uniform
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
traffic control devices which is
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
published by Federal Highway um so I
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
won't I won't repeat that uh one thing
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
that I would add is that the current um
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
the current bill was was kind of
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
prompted by action we took in around 20
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
2013 uh when the New Hampshire
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation uh adopted
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
the attractions category uh the specific
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
service signs that that came some years
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
after the original food gas lodging
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
camping uh and when we had the food gas
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
lodging camping uh starting in the 90 in
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
1995 we only put the the specific logos
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
on the ramps and we had generic symbols
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
for those four categories that we could
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
put out on the highway to let people
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
know that those Services were available
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
and then they could find out what the
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
specific choices were when they were on
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
the ramp when we adopted the attractions
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
category it was was harder to do that
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
because there isn't a generic symbol for
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
attractions uh so that that prompted
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
those signs to go on the main line uh
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
which then prompted the bill to add uh
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
the other categories on the mainline
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
south of conquer uh and we've defined
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
north of conquer uh at least for our
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
program to be um I want to say exit
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
three on 89 exit 17 and 93 and all of
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
the divided section of of the Spalding
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
TR Pike through rooch Chester uh the
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
extension of this balding turnpike north
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
of there where it goes to two lanes uh
 
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
is not included in the
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
program um so it there's a history with
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
it there specific service signs I
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
noticed representative Horan mentioned
 
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
the term advertising Federal Highway
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
does not consider them to be advertising
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
they're a directional signing to for a
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
specific Motor Service um but the
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
reality is that most of the participants
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the public consider it as
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
advertising uh as indicated by
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan's testimony um
 
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
it's popular for most of the folks that
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
are in it uh we've had some concern
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
about the cost uh of our contract
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
Service um we we don't make a profit on
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
it uh we do get um some payback out of
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
their um the revenue that they generate
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
but it essentially offsets our cost to
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
administer the program we are not
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
allowed by Statute to um to generate
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue out of it uh just to offset the
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
cost of the program so that self
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
supporting with that I'd be happy to
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:17:58.159 --> 01:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
take any
questions

01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
um representative FL okay thank you Mr
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um the prime sponsor represent
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
poran mentioned that that this program
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
now makes a small profit for the state
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
can you comment I I assume is that a
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
profit for the highway fund thank you no
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
like I just said we he did say that uh
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
we we get money back from the contractor
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
that that manages the program um but
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed by Statute to generate
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue we're only allowed to offset the
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
costs to make it self-supporting uh so
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're essentially paying us um back to
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
the highway fund our cost to administer
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
the program so we've got probably one
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
and a half positions of persons that are
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for outdoor
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
advertising control um and and most of
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
their time is spent on the logo program
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
what we call a logo program so they're
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
essentially just paying that back plus
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
other administrative
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
cost okay thank you thank you and follow
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
on to that if I may um when you say that
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
they are reimbursing or um for the
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
administrative cost is the state
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
recovering all of the administrative
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
costs that this program is costing
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
through this
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
contract um I would say initially no the
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
way that the contract was written was
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
that they uh and it was a
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
a u request for proposals we had one
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
response to that proposal and their
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
proposals that they would pay us I think
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's 50,000 a year uh or 5% whichever
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
was greater so as their program is
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
started we're getting that 50,000 which
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite offset our direct cost um
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
but it does um have the ability as they
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
add more signs and generate more Revenue
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
over time U that 5% uh number should get
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
eel I mute yourself yeah um good to see
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lambert um I don't know about
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
others I don't seem to have your
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't know if it would have
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
come from you or or Kathleen so if this
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
was covered in there could you um
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
refresh our memories on the uh Genesis
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the exclusion of the uh signs from
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state I'm I I'm
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
remembering that part of the concern
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
there was to keep the North Country a
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
little more free of of signage but maybe
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
you can um help us and if you could
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
resend your testimony that would be
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah I'd be happy too I'm not sure
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
how I I submitted the testimony on the
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
link that was provided I'm not sure how
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
that gets distributed um
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Graham I'd be happy to send
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
it to you or if there's somebody else I
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
can do that to uh it's all new me and I
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
will get it make sure it gets out to
 
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
everybody all right I appreciate that
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
and it's good to see you again as well
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative EO uh the Genesis of the
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
Restriction of the uh the area north of
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
conquer and in my written testimony uh I
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
I indicated that when the program was
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
first adopted by us in 1995 there were
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
two people that were involved then in
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
developing our administrative roles that
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
were involved with the program kind of
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
on the legislative side and our staff
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
side for a lot of years and one of those
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
was representative Chandler from
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
Bartlett and he was adamantly opposed to
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of blue signs on the side of
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
the highway especially up in the North
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
Country um in in around the mid teens uh
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
there was there was a bill moving
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
forward um not the one that was
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
eventually passed that added the
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
mainline s self are conquered but the I
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
think the session before that and kind
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
of as an aside representative Chandler
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
said something to the effect of I don't
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
care what you do self have conquered U
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
so that led to language in the bill uh
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
that that allowed the science to be on
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
the mainline south of conquer um and
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is now um from my
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
perspective there are certainly rural
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
interchanges North have conquered and
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
some of them South are conquered where
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have a lot of of the the food

represent Hillsboro 21 which is the town
 
01:24:46.199 --> 01:24:46.950 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro 21 which is the town
of

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
marac um many of you who have been on
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
this committee for years knows that this
 
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
isn't the first marac to bill that
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
you've seen uh many bills regarding the
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
Turnpike tolls in miramac have come
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
before this Committee in one way or
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
another they have sought relief from the
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
unfair burden on miramac residents who
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
have shouldered a disproportional
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the cost of the ever
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
turnpike's operation and maintenance
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
this unfairness continues with plans to
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
install open road tolling in marac just
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
north of exit 8 um that was included in
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
the transportation Omnibus Bill that was
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
passed last summer by the house I ask
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
the committee to return to the basics of
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
what a Turnpike is as you consider
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
consider this bill turnpikes are user
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
funded drivers that use a Turnpike pay
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
for it to be fair and Equitable the toll
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
should be assessed for all users
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
proportionately fairness and Equity that
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
is what this bill is about this bill is
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
not about banning tolls in miramac it is
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
about assessing tolls where the road
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
gets the most use data from the New
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Transportation
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
shows the heaviest traffic is along the
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
nashille corridor in fact the busiest
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
stretch has already been designed and
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
constructed to accommodate tol boo
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately politics scuttled this
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
plan and the busiest section of the
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
turnpike remains free for users this is
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
not what a Turnpike is supposed to be so
 
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
i' I'd be happy to intro uh to um answer
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have um the the
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill is pretty simple in its language
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's really just to uh Place tools where
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the there are more
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
users thank
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from members
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%

01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative BL who is in the room as
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
a member of the
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
comme thank you Mr chairman um yeah so I
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief but um just to Echo
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
what representative rung said obviously
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
for many many years the citizens of of
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
marac have been disproportionately
 
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
affected they practically can't move
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't move in the town without paying
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
a toll um and you know luckily some of
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
the tolls have been removed now and so
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's no longer the case but um marac
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
is not the the busiest section um nsha
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
is and so uh if we're going to at some
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
point add new tolls back in um it should
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
be where there is the most traffic and
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
not uh where the people of marac will be
 
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
not uh where the people of marac will be
disproportionately

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
affected are there any questions from
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%

Prime sponsor is one of the most
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
outstanding members of the house there's
 
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
anybody Works harder to serve the people
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
of her town or her or her state so this
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
um these exit are a severe inconvenience
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the people of marac who have to uh
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know who have to pay to get on and
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
off the turnpike even they just like
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
using it to get across town and um it's
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
also inconvenience for other
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%

01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%

01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
inconvenience for other motorists too
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
because uh theyve were talking a minute
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
ago about uh motorist services and
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
attractions miramac has actually many of
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
those it's a fine community years it
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
does a lot more than just connect uh
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
Bedford to Bedford to uh to NASA and um
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
so I think uh you know and those
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
motorist services um I think they have
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
the blue signs on the highway and
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
certainly they're also like Jason to the
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
exit more so than many other exits so
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
this is an inconvenience for all
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
motorists and um yeah and also to boost
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
and general are an obsolete uh
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
technology we're moving towards overhead
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
tolling but uh we do do the overhead
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
tolling um you know all communities
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
should be treated fairly so certainly uh
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
marac people of marac or visitors to
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
marac should not have to pay more tolls
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
and visitors in Nashville or any the
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
other towns along the along the along
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
our limited access highways so that's
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
why I just wanted to chime in and say
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill so thanks thank you
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative forgan
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%

I'm Nancy Murphy a Marin Mack resident
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to say that I would
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
hope that you could um vote a to pass on
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
this bill um our March Community has
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
been a has shouldered a large financial
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
burden for the New Hampshire toll system
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and um I I think
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
citizens feel like we certainly um you
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
know are uh need need to pay our our
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
part uh but it seems our part continues
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
to uh to maybe be uh exceed that of of
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
other uh users of the of the tolls so um
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
I would ask that um you can you consider
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um as a relief for the town of
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
marac um and that um a a in the the
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
transportation plan a determination be
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
made where the usage is where that if
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
there's a higher usage that tolls be put
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
in there uh which will of course you
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
know help uh the state but will also
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
unburden marac residence so that was it
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%

the Executive Vice President of the
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm we just I will tell you I
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
bring these bills before my board of
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
directors um this bill we
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed we had a major concern about
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
this bill that it kind of sets a
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
precedence uh when it comes to
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
construction planning that you would
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
start to file legislation if you didn't
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
want something thing without really
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
knowing the full scope as we all know
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
the marac tolls we also know for a long
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
time there was just one marac toll and
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
then there was going to be a circumen
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
highway G to be a toll in Nasher and
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a toll in Bedford
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
Nash didn't go it has a long history but
 
01:35:18.189 --> 01:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
what we see is one of our major concerns
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
is it sets a precedent of communities
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
filing legislation with the state house
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
saying they don't want tolls and this
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
would be in my opinion or in our
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
association's opinion a bad precedent to
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
start setting it should be really
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
discussed as projects are proposed and
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
toll booths are proposed in the future
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's I also think that there's concern
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
of binding one legislative uh group to
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
another through this kind of action this
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
really is different than what we've seen
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
in the past to have an outright statute
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
that bans a certain thing whether it's
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
tolls in a community or not so I just
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that with the committee
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
that that is one of the things we looked
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
at we know the legislature will look at
 
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
any future projects and consider those
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
on Case by case and the legislature over
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
the last few years has removed tolls
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
from maramax so um you know that should
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
be an important point but with that uh
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the time
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%

Transportation uh before I begin my
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
remarks I just want to thank the chair
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%

01:37:23.119 --> 01:37:24.350 align:start position:0%
to talking about the roles of the
department

01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
um in more detail uh this afternoon but
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
this morning I wanted to speak to the
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and just make sure
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
the committee understands how the
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
current 10-year plan process works as
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of do I do not add projects
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
to the 10-year plan the 10-year plan
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
process is a three-phase process um the
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
first phase we work with gasset um the
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
governor's advisory committee on
 
01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.310 align:start position:0%
governor's advisory committee on
Intermodal

01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
Intermodal
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
transportation and then we work with the
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
governor and the SEC phase and then the
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
last phase is the legislative phase and
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
so as commissioner I don't have the
 
01:38:01.589 --> 01:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
authority to add projects into the 10e
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
plan in the gaset phase that first phase
 
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is a non voting member
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
of gaset and so really um in each phase
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
the department is tasked with drafting a
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
plan on behalf of that body who is um
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
overseeing that phase of the process um
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
so it's either gaset that would
 
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
introduce a project um the governor
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
or the legislature um so my I just want
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure you understood what
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
authorities the commissioner of
 
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation currently has as you

01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%

01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislature thank you commissioner are
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%

up in this executive session is House
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%

01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
certain New Hampshire Supreme Court

Records uh representative Mills you have
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
a motion I do Mr chair uh regards the
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
fact that this is mostly due to the
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
capital budget I move to retain House
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 595 I will second that Mr chairman
 
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
the motion has been made and seconded
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
that the committee retain House Bill
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
595 I would like to say one thing I
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
support this motion it is it is been the
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
longstanding practice of the committee
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
that when we have large Capital
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in $2 million believe it
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
or not is the large appropriation for
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures in the capital
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
budget that we fundle them all into the
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
capital budget so that when the go uh
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
the governor presents his um capital
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
budget and the treasurer tells us what
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
we can afford to bond that we can look
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
at all of the projects at the same time
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
rather than just having peace meal we
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
have found that that has worked under
 
01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.149 align:start position:0%
have found that that has worked under
chairman

01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:41:45.159 --> 01:41:47.070 align:start position:0%
chairman
like

01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
represent and and others we we tried to
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
so does anybody else have anything to
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
say about the motion to retain House
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
Bill 595 Mr chairman I just like to Echo
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
your statements and I think this is a
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
very worthwhile but hopefully we can
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
include some money in the capital budget
 
01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
for this task and maybe get the bar
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
association to chip in I that up so but
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
I I think we should retain it definitely
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%

pass Mr chairman but I do have a
 
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
question do Mr Lambert testify what what
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
was his position did he indicate it was
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
informational informational only okay as
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
as as usual okay I'm it's a legit I the
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
way I gathered it was a
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
legislative uh prerogative to say y or n
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
they provide information okay all right
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
in this case and sometimes because
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do take a position just
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
for has moved on to pass on
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
305 is there a
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
second representative Jack second like
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
to speak to my motion please when don't
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
you get a chance okay thank you I
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
believe last term it was a different
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
committee the house Transportation
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
committee passed this bill and I believe
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
it went to the house was on consent
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
calendar passed and then we sent it the
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
Senate and then the pandemic hit and
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
they didn't do anything it was just not
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
one of their priorities and I think in
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
Reading represent corgan's testimony uh
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
beforehand I just think this makes sense
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's a it's an argue a fairness
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
issue I don't know that's what I think
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
it may make is Maybe Can't a profit but
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
it may help offset some of the costs
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
that do has of monitoring the sign and
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
at least it should be a break even you
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
know that it shouldn't be costing do
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
anything to put up these
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
signs you know uh so I feel it's
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
important that we pass this bill the
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
Full House pass it send to the sen
 
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully this time the Senate will do
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
the right thing thank you thank you any
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%

representative CL here yes Mr chairman
 
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
um with I appreciate the prime sponsor
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and all the sponsors motivation for
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
putting this in if I lived in marac I'd
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
obviously want to do something about
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
this issue but I have to look at it as a
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
former chair Vice chair Etc I've been
 
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.350 align:start position:0%
former chair Vice chair Etc I've been
around

01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
I've got to look at the total impact on
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
the on the turnpike
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
system and it would be great you know I
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
think the prime sponsor mentioned about
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
something about putting them elsewhere
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
well the problem is the people in in the
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
area she mentioned are not wild about a
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
toll and I remember being here and we
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
tried that your entire majority of our
 
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
committee agreed to do it we brought in
 
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
the house for part of the 10e plan and
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
it was immediately took out you make
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
made your head spin I didn't figure they
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
they get the votes I figured it would
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
just be the people in the affected area
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that's basically it the problem is
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
no one wants a toll booth in their area
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh but it's something too it's something
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
that was put in before I came to this
 
01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislature so we have to have revenue
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
for if we're going to have a turn plight
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
system if we abolish it we're still
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to have to maintain those roads
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe when I was in my first
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
term there was a similar bill that Mar m
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
reps put in and the and and we were told
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know this is true but this is in
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
1993 that it was going to if we
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
abolished all the tolls in the entire
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
system and granted it that's what it
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
aimed to do a 10cent increase in the gas
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
tax so and maybe that was who knows
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
whether that was right or not but the
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
point is if we abolish tolls we're still
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to maintain those roads
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it's going to have to come from
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere whether it's a turn flight
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
fund or or a highway fund and gas taxes
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
Etc no one wants to pay more on gas tax
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
either so with some reluctance I'm going
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
to vote the motion to support itl and
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can I don't know get an and
 
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
I've tried to work with past the the
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
town of marac on on some sort of
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
compromise because I can understand if I
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
was from that area believe me I'd want
 
01:51:10.069 --> 01:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
to eliminate as many tolls and I think
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
now it's because of the of a bill we
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
passed increasing the gas tax a few
 
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
years ago or the road toll and the
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
governor and council's action last year
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
I think two out of the three tolls have
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
now been eliminated so we're making
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
making progress if you look at it from a
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
marac perspective I just don't think
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're there yet until we can get some
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
sort of agreement where we want what we
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
want to do with tolls whether it's open
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
road tolling or put them in a particular
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
part of the state you know that
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
everybody can agree upon so that's all I
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
have to say Thank you Mr representative
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
fluier representative fuler you have
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
your hand raised yes thank you Mr
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I just want to add I think
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
that if we get into judging what's fair
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
by what town people come
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
from we're never going to hear the end
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
of it you know we've already heard
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
miramac versus Nashville and it'll be
 
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
conquer versus Manchester the only fair
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
way to allocate the cost of the turnpike
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
is by how much people use it and that
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
ought to be our Criterion and our only
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
Criterion if there's an
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
exception for some other reason and I
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
know I've heard that you know we don't
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
want to have a exit a a toll before the
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
first exit because of the people coming
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
up to the
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
mall uh then it ought to be judged on
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
whether that has a positive impact on
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole rather than one
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
Town versus another because I just think
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
this town versus town is going to be an
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
forever thank
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
plac one of the
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh I just want to point out
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't really about Town versus
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
Town it is about the use so it I think
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
the reason why representative rung
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
brought up NASA versus marac is because
 
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
NASA has higher traffic it's used more
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
than marac so it we're not really
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
comparing towns we are trying to compare
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
usage thank
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
you I see no
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
other hands
 
01:53:18.189 --> 01:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
raise from our virtual members and none
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
in here um
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%

representative Graham introduce the Bill
 
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
committee I am representative John
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
Graham hillsbor District which is the
 
02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
town of Bedford I bring this forward as
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
at the request of constituents within
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
the town to live along tber Lane um
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
tberry Lane parallels the F Turn Pipe in
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
the to of
 
02:03:55.470 --> 02:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
Bedford it was built and the houses were
 
02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
built primarily there before the fir
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
Pike was expanded when I was going up
 
02:04:04.990 --> 02:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
the divided highway
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
ended at where is now exit 5 in
 
02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
nashille um and you got off it then
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
became a two l Road all the way up to
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh um so as the turnpike has
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
expanded the houses are there they are
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
older homes by and large um not
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
insulated for sound protection or the
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
rest uh but they run into a problem
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
every time that the Turn Pipe is
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
expanded or rebuilt and widened that
 
02:04:40.589 --> 02:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
they don't meet the
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
density um rule under erection of sound
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
walls it's not enough houses along that
 
02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
road even though the decb that the
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
actual sound that is hitting those Downs
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
actually does
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
exceed what should be done um so I bring
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
this forward um
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
and one of returning members of the
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee know we've heard this bill
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
before um it is a perennial issue um for
 
02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
the residents of pberry Lane and hence
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh representatives from Bedford so I
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
bring this for one of the last times it
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
was heard there was talk about it didn't
 
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
meet Federal Highway funding guidance
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
which is why you see that I am
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the cost be taken out of
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
ter fund since it's along the ter um but
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
that is up to the community to determine
 
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
where the charge would come from but I
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
think as a matter of working with with
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
the people of tberry Lane who have been
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
long suffering on this issue that we go
 
02:05:56.470 --> 02:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and pass this bill and with that I
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
will try to take any questions um I
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
think the the apartment is
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
also available at the end to talk about
 
02:06:09.709 --> 02:06:09.719 align:start position:0%
cost and benefits and the rest
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
but I will leave it at that thank you
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative Graham are there
 
02:06:18.549 --> 02:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
questions for representative gr I yes
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent to you recognize um under
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
Grand tberry Lane where is that with
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
respect to uh where 101
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
crosses it it is essentially if you know
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
if you're headed south on uh the F A you
 
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
go on the underpass where Target and
 
02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
um low dep are up on the H and now some
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
hotels up there a little bit further
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's on the right it's it's separated by
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
some trees essentially from the F so
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's on that side is there followup
 
02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:59.149 align:start position:0%
it's on that side is there followup
thank

02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
you are there are there further
 
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
questions for yes
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
repres uh were the houses I'm assuming
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
the houses are not that old that they
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
were built before the
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
turnpike by a large yes I I can't
 
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee every one of them was built
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
before the turnpike was widened and it
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
widen in the last few years as well as
 
02:07:28.589 --> 02:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
we um worked on the U airport Access
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
Road and made additional um lanes for
 
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
that that run right by that very
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
area thank you further questions for
 
02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:41.990 align:start position:0%
area thank you further questions for
representative

02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
gram yes
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
years there but there's a huge diff the
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
question was for those of may not have
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
heard it is the highway has been there
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
for for a longer time than what I was
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
talking about about the extension but
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between a
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
two-lane road um Meandering through um
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
marac and and others and bedord in
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
Manchester as opposed to a four lane
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
divided highway actually about six Lanes
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
through there right now three each
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
Direction with trucks and
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
increased traffic and all the rest so it
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
decades thank you represent kazinski are
 
02:08:47.229 --> 02:08:47.239 align:start position:0%

please go right can you hear me now yes

I can sir okay thank you very much uh Mr
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
chairman and and committee members uh I
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to say uh to begin with that I am
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
totally a Big supporter of sound
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
barriers uh when the uh do has certified
 
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
that a community or a neighborhood
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
deserves them in fact some of you some
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
of the members on this committee know
 
02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
that a year ago I actually submitted a
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh not only to increase Highway
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
funding which is desperately needed but
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
also to set aside a small amount of that
 
02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.910 align:start position:0%
also to set aside a small amount of that
for

02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
annually uh taking care of our 49
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
locations that have been certified to
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
need uh sound barriers uh neighborhoods
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
that have uh like the neighborhood in
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
Portsmith have been waiting sometimes
 
02:10:28.549 --> 02:10:28.559 align:start position:0%
over 30 years to get what they've been
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
certified to have be entitled to but
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
because there was a lack of funding of
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
it now I understand that you know uh
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
every neighborhood has its own unique
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
situation but I want to point out that
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
in contrast to uh the Bedford site uh
 
02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
the one in in Portsmith for example
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
expands up to 12 Lanes of traffic in
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
that neighborhood and the sound is
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
incredible uh so there is a process that
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
the do has for dealing with this at
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
least as far as putting them on a list
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
of type two noise abatement projects
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
however the problem has always been
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
funding so I I am a strong supporter of
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
doing both funding for sound barriers
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
and increasing the highway funding uh
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand this bill in my
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
opinion and I'm a cheap skate and I'm a
 
02:11:22.589 --> 02:11:22.599 align:start position:0%
fiscally conservative Democrat both
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
personally and publicly uh this bill is
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded there is no funding for it and
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's $2 million of unfund for a
 
02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
worthwhile project however without a
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
designated source of Revenue so uh
 
02:11:38.830 --> 02:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
because of that I think it's it's
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
inherently a questionable project uh now
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm more than willing to offer my bill
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to this bill so that we
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
could get some funding for it as well as
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund however uh under
 
02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
the conditions that it is right now uh I
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
would be opposing it and I want to point
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
out that the panaway manor neighborhood
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
that I represent is a bluecollar
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that was built for World
 
02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
War II workers at the shipyard and uh
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
these are very modest homes and very
 
02:12:13.069 --> 02:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
modest uh incomes and I uh since I used
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be a resident of Amherst I know that
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
Bedford is a relatively wealthy
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
community so I'm assuming that they made
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
enough noise to get themselves onto a
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh a one onetime bill just for them
 
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that is a process we want to
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
avoid too if we want to have every one
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the 49 sites sub submit their own
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
bill Standalone without funding asking
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
you to approve it I think it would be a
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
chaotic process and I hope you will
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
decide not to uh uh agree with this bill
 
02:12:45.629 --> 02:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
as written thank you very much for your
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%

02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
I apologize I did not jot down um the
 
02:14:14.589 --> 02:14:14.599 align:start position:0%
gentleman's name who was just speaking I
 
02:14:19.229 --> 02:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
do agree with him when he states that it
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a clunky process to have
 
02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.750 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a clunky process to have
each

02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
each
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
49 um towns to submit it individually
 
02:14:31.549 --> 02:14:31.559 align:start position:0%
however there has been extensive work on
 
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
behalf of tberry Lane to go about doing
 
02:14:37.870 --> 02:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
this so to vote against it simply
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
because each Town needs to of the clunky
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
process I'll just summarize it as that
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
um would be um passive and if it is in
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
fact um voted against for that specific
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
reason then I would like to know what
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
the process would be going forward to
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
try to push this forward um in the best
 
02:15:02.189 --> 02:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
interest for the quality of the lives of
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
the T bery Lane residences which the
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
homes from what I could see have been
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
erected in the
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
80s um I'm I'm not sure what the lady's
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
name who was asking about when they were
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
when they were built but around the 80s
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
from what I could see just by using the
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
public information just quickly just a
 
02:15:23.679 --> 02:15:26.310 align:start position:0%
public information just quickly just a
moment

02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
ago jie could I ask you to I believe you
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
asked a question of the chair and I'm
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
not sure what your question was can I
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
ask you to repeat that please if you had
 
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
a question sure the question is if the
 
02:15:43.229 --> 02:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
if this is voted against the
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
bill I would like because because of the
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
reason for the clunkiness of each Town
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
having to submit their own case to have
 
02:15:53.549 --> 02:15:53.559 align:start position:0%
a sound wall erected I would like to
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
know what the process would be going
 
02:15:58.109 --> 02:15:58.119 align:start position:0%
forward to try to get this sound wall
 
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
erected if not just for tberry Lane then
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
going forward for all 49 towns that are
 
02:16:08.109 --> 02:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
asking for it okay thank you uh the the
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
process would be to uh work with your I
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
believe to start with your Regional
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
Authority um transportation and try and
 
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
get it included in as part of a a
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
10-year plan or this is the Federal
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
process understood uh from what I
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
understand though it is not a Federal
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
Highway um it was sold to the
 
02:16:37.309 --> 02:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
state I I believe you are correct in
 
02:16:41.549 --> 02:16:41.559 align:start position:0%
that so there is a process um and um
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
that is ongoing and uh speak with your
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
Regional uh planning Authority and work
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
if it were to indeed fail today okay
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
you next to
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
speak represent Jack is there someone
 
02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:06.950 align:start position:0%
speak represent Jack is there someone
else

02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:08.549 align:start position:0%
else

02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
oh um the chair recognizes Chris wanek
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
you just unmute and U state your name
 
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
and I have have not seen you for a
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
couple years just like to say hello and
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
please uh
 
02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
testify well good morning I think it's
 
02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.790 align:start position:0%
testify well good morning I think it's
still

02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
morning um representative Mr chair um
 
02:17:42.509 --> 02:17:42.519 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh Chris waschuk and I'm Deputy
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the Department of
 
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation and what I like to do I
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
did I did um submit testimony which I'm
 
02:17:56.589 --> 02:17:56.599 align:start position:0%
going to kind of go through fairly
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
quickly U relative to this bill um the
 
02:18:02.669 --> 02:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
department is certainly sympathetic to
 
02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
the plight of this affected neighborhood
 
02:18:09.389 --> 02:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
as well as there are almost 300
 
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods across the state that have
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
noise um
 
02:18:16.589 --> 02:18:16.599 align:start position:0%
issues um you know in noise is certainly
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
a serious issue um adjacent to our state
 
02:18:21.309 --> 02:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
highways and certainly has an impact on
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
the quality of life of those people
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
living there um sound walls and noise
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
barriers when effectively and properly
 
02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
designed will reduce the sound of
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
traffic um that NE negatively affect
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
those areas while sympathetic to tberry
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
Lane and those
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
residences um the department cannot
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
support this bill based on the
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria and
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
funding that is TB landan does not meet
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
the criteria of our noise wall policy
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
and there aren't sufficient funds
 
02:18:53.950 --> 02:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
residential areas must meet specific
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
criteria to be eligible for sound walls
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh that eligibility criteria
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
incorporates Federal requirements and
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
provides uniformity and consistency to
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
make the process Fair Statewide keber
 
02:19:07.709 --> 02:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
Lane does not meet the eligibility
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
criteria for sound walls um the
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
department has a noise policy that
 
02:19:12.519 --> 02:19:14.030 align:start position:0%
department has a noise policy that
policy

02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
was um well the department has operated
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
under that noise abatement policy for
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
over 20 years the first
 
02:19:24.429 --> 02:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
policy um was signed and enacted by then
 
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner lean Kennison and approved
 
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
by Federal Highway in
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
1996 more recently in November of
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
2016 the department with Federal
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
highways approval updated the noise
 
02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
policy to include both type one and type
 
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
two Highway projects type one being a
 
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
project um where there is proposed work
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
for example right now we have the fit
 
02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
widening that is proposed on the
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
turnpike in nashille meramac and Bedford
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
um and under that project this actual
 
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
location was evaluated and I will talk
 
02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
to that in one moment uh type two is a
 
02:20:05.710 --> 02:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
location where there is no Highway
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
Improvement programmed and where there
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
was no prior determination that a noise
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
abatement measure was not feasible or
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
not reasonable so these policies have
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
really guided and continued to guide the
 
02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
noise assessment in developing all of
 
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
the Department's Highway projects to
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
ensure consistency and
 
02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:24.429 align:start position:0%
ensure consistency and
fairness

02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
um relative to tberry Lane so this
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
neighborhood noise assessments were
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
conducted um on several
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
occasions first occasion being when an
 
02:20:38.349 --> 02:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
airport Access Road was planned there
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
was an environmental impact study that
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
was done at that time that was back in
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
1997 um the final environmental impact
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
um statement was issued in 2001
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
on page
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
four 154 of that document tber Lane
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhood is discussed and it states
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
in that document that area 4 which is TB
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
Lane has a total of six impacted
 
02:21:05.710 --> 02:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
residential receptors located along TB
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
Lane and County Road in Bedford west of
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
the southbound travel Lanes of the Y
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
Turn Pike where noise barrier would be
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
an effective mitigation measure at that
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
time a preliminary engineering
 
02:21:19.230 --> 02:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
assessment identified the barrier to be
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
almost, 1500 ft long and cost
 
02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
almost, 1500 ft long and cost
approximately

02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
$85,000 it was noted that seven
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
residential receptors would receive a
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
noise reduction benefit of 58 deci
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
however it concluded that based on
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
preliminary information gathered to date
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
it would not be economically reasonable
 
02:21:39.389 --> 02:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh to construct the barrier based on the
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
cost effective Effectiveness criteria of
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
the policy in November 2011 noise
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
measurements were taken by the
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
Department's Bureau of environment and
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
confirmed the results of the airport
 
02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
Access Road FIS that at least five
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
likely six residences approach or exceed
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
the noise abatement criteria of 67 de so
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
um without a doubt there is high noise
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
levels at these
 
02:22:05.790 --> 02:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
locations however based on the
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
reasonableness cost criteria it was
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
determined that a noise barrier
 
02:22:10.990 --> 02:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
dislocation would exceed the cost
 
02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
criteria by almost four times 115,000
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
per benefiting resident as compared to
 
02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
the 30,000 cost criteria at that time
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
more recently as part of the preliminary
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
engineering envir and environmental
 
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
study work for the Nashville marac
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
Bedford Manchester project or the F
 
02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
widening project um a noise assessment
 
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
was conducted and completed as part of
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
the environmental study for that project
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
as part of that project 25 noise analys
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
locations were evaluated along the
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
corridor with noise measurements from
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
2016 as well as what they do is they use
 
02:22:52.990 --> 02:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
future noise predicted by fhwa traffic
 
02:22:57.309 --> 02:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
noise prediction model 20 of these
 
02:23:00.429 --> 02:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
25 uh locations were identified with
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
high noise that exceeds or meets the
 
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:05.870 align:start position:0%
high noise that exceeds or meets the
noise

02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
noise
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
criteria 20 of 25 tber Lane in County
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
Road uh were one of the 25 areas
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
evaluated and one of the 20 areas which
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
included had high noise and will
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
continue to have high noise in the
 
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:21.469 align:start position:0%
continue to have high noise in the
future

02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
the study found that an optimal noise
 
02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
barrier would be a little over 2200 feet
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
similar to what the airport Access Road
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
study determined an average 16 feet in
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
height um and would benefit nine
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
residences so would benefit three more
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
residences providing at least a 5 deel
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
reduction so this would result in
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 3600 square feet of
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
barrier or 4,000 sare ft per residence
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
which exceeds the 1500 square foot cost
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness criteria that we have
 
02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
we've changed from um a cost requirement
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
to a dimensional requirement it's, 1500
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
sare ft now per residence that is the
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
criteria um on page 413 of the
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
environmental study states that the area
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
is expected to experience noise impacts
 
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
but exceeds the square footage threshold
 
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore is not reasonable so no
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
barriers proposed as part of that type
 
02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:18.990 align:start position:0%
barriers proposed as part of that type
one

02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
project as of the FF widening project
 
02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
noise barriers in seven of the 20 High
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
noise locations are proposed as part of
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
that project because they meet the
 
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
criteria for noise and cost
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness the estimated cost of
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
those barriers is $8.8 million which
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
will be funded and paid for under the
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
project the other 13 locations including
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
tberry Lane do not meet the criteria for
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
cost effectivess although they do meet
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
the criteria for noise and no barriers
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
are proposed is part of that project
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
these 13 locations would cost an
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
additional 13.2 million if no uh cost
 
02:24:58.439 --> 02:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
additional 13.2 million if no uh cost
criteria

02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
existed or dimensional criteria
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
exists reconducted uh noise assessments
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
routinely as part of uh projects and
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
there are many locations where the
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
barrier is feasible so it meets the
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
noise reduction criteria however is not
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable because it's not cost
 
02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
effective based on recent just and this
 
02:25:28.269 --> 02:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
is just the last over the last decade um
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
recent project development projects
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
there were 29 individual locations which
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
were eliminated from noise barrier
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
construction because they did not meet
 
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
the Department's noise policy for cost
 
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
effective in total these locations would
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
exceed $32 million and they're in
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
locations in Salem all the way up
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
through Manchester on i93 quarter in
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
Newton along the Spen
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
Corridor in the vicinity of the airport
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
Access Road in Manchester Manchester
 
02:26:00.670 --> 02:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
Auburn on another Manchester location so
 
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
there are many locations Statewide where
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
homes exist in relative close proximity
 
02:26:07.469 --> 02:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
to the highway and have high noise
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
levels the state cannot afford to
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
provide noise barriers at all these
 
02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
provide noise barriers at all these
locations

02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
um we have conducted and what
 
02:26:19.269 --> 02:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative s said in his earlier
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
testimony referred L Type two um noise
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
assessment it's kind of a screening
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
study where 298 areas were reviewed and
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
turn keep every lane was one of those um
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
that document is on our website it was
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
done in
 
02:26:38.670 --> 02:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
2017 the study revealed that 49
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
locations Statewide 26 on the turnpike
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
system and 23 on the non-turn Pike
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
highways meet the eligibility criteria
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
for noise abatement in both visibility
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
as well as reasonableness or cost
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness the estimated total
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
barrier length to address those 49
 
02:26:59.469 --> 02:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
locations is 37 miles and the estimated
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
cost in today's dollars is 190 million
 
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
keury Lane was not one of those 49
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
down on that list actually they were
 
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
91st so 90 90 locations have high noise
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
as well as a cost Effectiveness criteria
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
higher than the tberry lane neighborhood
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
um presently there is no funding in a
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
10-year plan to address any of these
 
02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
noise impeded locations these type two
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
locations um in conclusion there have
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
been many bills filed over the years to
 
02:27:42.429 --> 02:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
address Highway noise in each time that
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
department cautions against approving
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
individual locations would suggest that
 
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
the issue be addressed as part of the
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
overall 10year plan process
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
um type two program was developed in
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
2016 to expand eligibility for stound
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
walls but it has not been
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
funded appropriating 1.8 million of
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds for a project in this
 
02:28:05.790 --> 02:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
location to construct sound walls when
 
02:28:07.469 --> 02:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
the barriers determin to not be coste
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
effective is question setting and will
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
open an avalanche of other requests and
 
02:28:15.269 --> 02:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
due to impacts of covid on traffic and
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
Turnpike toll Revenue delays to Major
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
Turnpike capital projects that are shown
 
02:28:22.349 --> 02:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
in the current 10-e plan are inevitable
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
and appropriating 1.8 million of
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
Turnpike Revenue will essentially draw
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
on those same funds being utiliz the
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
capital program create further delays so
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
for the above reasons the the department
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
cannot support use funds federal funds
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
are Highway funds for the construction
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
of this are and with that I'll be happy
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner are there uh questions from
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
the members in the
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
room are there questions
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
from um those others in attendance

testimony
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
um wishing to speak representative Jack
 
02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in there wishing to
 
02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:27.630 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in there wishing to
speak

02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
seeing no other
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
speakers is that is that correct Jack
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
seeing no other
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
speakers um I will uh bring uh House
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:57.870 align:start position:0%

02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
moving right along I would like to open
 
02:30:03.790 --> 02:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill 114
 
02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:06.750 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill 114
at

02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
then what is the pleasure of the
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative M uh thank you
 
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I would like to move U
 
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
itl on on house
 
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill4 if I could have a moment after
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's a second to speak to that
 
02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative Abbott seconds it's been
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that house bill
 
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
114 even though it's from the chairman
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
be found in expediate to
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislate discussion representative MCC
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I uh try not
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
to do this too many times to your
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward um I uh and
 
02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
former members of this
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
committee speaking for myself are very
 
02:30:58.510 --> 02:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
sympathetic with the noise generated by
 
02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:00.030 align:start position:0%
sympathetic with the noise generated by
this

02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
highway and we have looked at this for a
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
years committee has not been in favor of
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
singular legislation coming before this
 
02:31:14.990 --> 02:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee to solve an issue and uh due
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
to the costs associated with this in
 
02:31:20.110 --> 02:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
addition to that not having a fing
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
source to to handle
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
itl I I do have one question of the
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
department just so that everybody is
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
clear if whoever from the department
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
wants to try to answer what I'm going to
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
ask um you talked about the top 49 that
 
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
that are in the criteria via one
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
90 uh million somewhere in that
 
02:31:56.790 --> 02:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhood what if we were to go
 
02:31:59.710 --> 02:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
beyond that what what kind of money are
 
02:32:03.269 --> 02:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
we talking about to bring satisfaction
 
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
along all of these highways where the
 
02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:07.150 align:start position:0%
along all of these highways where the
neighbors

02:32:07.150 --> 02:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
have high noise level but don't meet the
 
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
other criteria do we have a figure for
 
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry representative because I
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
I was actually I needed to rejoin
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
thatp can you repeat the question and
 
02:32:26.269 --> 02:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer it um how
 
02:32:26.279 --> 02:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer it um how
much

02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
um you testified it was about for the 49
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned about 190 million if
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
we were to go beyond that and go to
 
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
everybody who is having noise problems
 
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
but don't meet the the criteria laid out
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
do we have a a ballpark figure on what
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
kind of money we're
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking yes that was actually I
 
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated that question so that I
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
asked um a staff to compile that list in
 
02:33:06.429 --> 02:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
essence there are 143 areas that were
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated as part of that type two study
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
that have high noise levels that so the
 
02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
noise is
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
exceeded um in order to address all
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
those 143 areas and they're both on the
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
term Pike system and and off the
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
turnpike system it's $450 million in
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
today's dollars and that is based on
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
they did an approximation of the square
 
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
footage required for each wall it's
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
based on the current estimate that it
 
02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
costs $46 a square foot to construct a
 
02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:40.469 align:start position:0%
costs $46 a square foot to construct a
noise

02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
noise
 
02:33:42.750 --> 02:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
barrier uh thank you I just wanted to
 
02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
get the ball park so that we could frame
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
the question going forward when we keep
 
02:33:52.429 --> 02:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
when I keep bringing this up
 
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh any other qu discussion on the part
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
of the U committee uh for those members
 
02:34:05.070 --> 02:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
of the public who have their hand raised
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
we are in executive session and we do
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
not take new testimony during uh the
 
02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:13.150 align:start position:0%
not take new testimony during uh the
executive

02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
executive
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
session um the only reason I asked the
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
do to come back is to get those figures
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
in our mind in my mind going forward
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson never
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
mind Mr chairman okay thank you with
 
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
some reluctance I am going to vote for
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
itl for this bill with all due respect
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman but I I'll tell you we've
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this committee has
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this issue for over 20
 
02:34:42.030 --> 02:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
years now I was here and I voted against
 
02:34:43.950 --> 02:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
a member of my own party for sound
 
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
barrier for for her area so it's an ongo
 
02:34:49.150 --> 02:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
and that was I guess I could say
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
portsman so represent sign 20 over that
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
was over that was 22 years
 
02:34:55.950 --> 02:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
ago we've been trying to deal but we
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
didn't have the money and I
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
think you know with all due respect
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
we've got to deal with this issue and I
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
suggest next year and I'd be willing to
 
02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
work with anybody else you know prep you
 
02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
know even though it's not my doesn't
 
02:35:11.309 --> 02:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
really affect my area to come up with
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
putting something the 10-year plan to
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
try to re try to begin to erect some of
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
these s in areas that meet the criteria
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
at least
 
02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with this and and another thing
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
I think represents the member from ports
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
repres S I hope I pronounced that name
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
right fail to mention he just mentioned
 
02:35:30.190 --> 02:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
the highway fund some of these I think
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
like your bill on the turnpike so we
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
could take money from the turn it isn't
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
all the highway fund we could take it
 
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
from both depending on where the the
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
barrier is to be erected but the point
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
is that there's money involved and I
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
don't see I think we need to begin to
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
address this in the 10-year plan is the
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
proper venue and if we were to pass this
 
02:35:51.070 --> 02:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think we'd have a fight and
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
there'd be amendments on the floor and
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
and plus next year even if it passed
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
even if it was retained there's going to
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
be a bunch of bills similar bills we're
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to consider but I think we
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I think all the sponsors
 
02:36:04.349 --> 02:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
including yourself make a good point and
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
I think we we've got to deal with it uh
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of money uh so I I think
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully next year I would be willing
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
to to have put something in the 10-year
 
02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
plan to begin to deal with this issue
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
because probably we're not going to deal
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
with it soon unless there's some federal
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
stimulus money that could be which I
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
doubt very much will happen in the next
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
year or so thank you any other members
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee have anything to add
 
02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
of the committee have anything to add
representative

02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
Kinski yes hi this is representative
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
kolansky cheser district 13 um
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
apologies I I just have a clar
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
clarification question um being newer
 
02:36:54.269 --> 02:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
member uh could you clarify what exactly
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the motion is and what it
 
02:37:00.990 --> 02:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
represents the motion before us is
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate usually
 
02:37:07.790 --> 02:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
abbreviated LL it means just that we are
 
02:37:10.269 --> 02:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
recommending to the entire House of
 
02:37:13.630 --> 02:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives that the bill be CL and
 
02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
and once the house votes on that if it
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
adopts the
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation then the bill is dead not
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
just for this um for this year um unless
 
02:37:25.950 --> 02:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
it comes back in a substantially
 
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
different format um so this is a our
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that this bill
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
not become uh law and it not go to the
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
Senate and that that would be the end of
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
for uh this this session okay thank you
 
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um if I heard this testimony
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
correctly from the
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
do the benefit was for nine
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
residences that is what he testified yes
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
$1.8 million that's $200,000 the house
 
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
could kind
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
of philosophy on this I don't know if
 
02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
it's possible for the government to
 
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
always keep the quality of your life the
 
02:38:21.269 --> 02:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
same no matter what happens around it
 
02:38:23.469 --> 02:38:23.479 align:start position:0%
just sounds like it's a recipe for
 
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
disaster for the state of trying
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
to trying to do that you know I gu you
 
02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
have a concern for noise I I just
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
thought I'd go out stick
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere well and and
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
speaking very perally because I live in
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
Bedford it does affect property values
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
once the noise goes up and if you try to
 
02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
sell the home as some of the residents
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
are my age or older and are looking at
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
their empty nesters and want to try to
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
to move on um the property value is not
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the rest of the
 
02:39:05.790 --> 02:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
community because of the
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
noise um and so that's part of the
 
02:39:11.469 --> 02:39:11.479 align:start position:0%
problem I understand what you're saying
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
about the cost benefit analysis to the
 
02:39:16.990 --> 02:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
state I may or may not agree with it in
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
this particular issue but what bothers
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.349 --> 02:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm just uh surprised that the
 
02:39:40.150 --> 02:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation is stuck on
 
02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:41.830 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation is stuck on
one

02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
solution to a vast problem when they one
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the at least the temporary solution I
 
02:39:51.389 --> 02:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
don't think any of us believe that that
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
section of Turnpike is
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
done that there isn't going to be more
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
work done there and in an area where
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's like you said um affecting property
 
02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
values and quality of life sometimes
 
02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
they can go in and put in a uh an
 
02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
evergreen barrier that isn't a the best
 
02:40:15.550 --> 02:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
solution but it's a relatively inexp
 
02:40:18.269 --> 02:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
inexpensive solution to a problem like
 
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
that I know it's been done other places
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the state it's not a permanent
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
solution because sometimes the
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
trees can't take the salt from the road
 
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
and it depends on what the layout of the
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
land is but it might be something for
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
them to look at I I agree with you
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
representa suggested that maybe we look
 
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
at that over the next year or so while
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're waiting to get the 10year plan I
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
know one time when I was in the minority
 
02:40:48.830 --> 02:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the chairman sent me to barab back to
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
talk with their to Cil about that very
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
thing putting in a green um barrier to
 
02:40:58.190 --> 02:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
help knock down the noise for a new
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
development that was going in um and the
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the department did look at it and
 
02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
did part of it not everything that they
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
wanted but part of it so we need to
 
02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
you're right we need to look at that um
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
but that is outside of this particular
 
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill and the motion that is before us
 
02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.710 align:start position:0%

02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
seriousness you have to take everything
 
02:43:56.590 --> 02:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
as as it comes now
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
that concludes every bill that has been
 
02:44:03.070 --> 02:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee thus far uh
 
02:44:06.510 --> 02:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
there were five we've reject all five um
 
02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
I cannot tell you when the house session
 
02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
will be um but we do have deadlines in
 
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar so you can sort of plan
 
02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
around that um when these bills will be
 
02:44:23.309 --> 02:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
heard the other piece
 
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the governor will provide us with the
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget honor about the 15th of
 
02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
February I may if I can work uh with
 
02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
some of the agencies maybe have some
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
meetings that week um because the bill
 
02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
itself won't be introduced till the week
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
after but we can begin work sessions on
 
02:44:46.590 --> 02:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
agencies um are asking for
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
um but stay tuned for that it will be in
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
this same format um you can attend
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
remotely or in person um but as we found
 
02:45:04.990 --> 02:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
out today some of what was supposedly
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
sent out um to the committee members has
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
not made it to everybody um as far as
 
02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um so I will work on that now
 
02:45:20.670 --> 02:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
we have an hour and 15 minutes until the
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
work session with uh Department of
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation I cannot start earlier
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%

uh cameras or whatever until
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
1:30 um this will stay open and up
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to close it out
 
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
and restart it um Mr Greenland will do
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
some I'm not sure if we Brad if you

what is open around
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
conquet area um I know various
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants have closed and reopened and
 
02:46:28.590 --> 02:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
closed again um the cafeteria in the
 
02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:31.720 align:start position:0%

yes um just I'm I'm assuming this is
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
okay but just to like give my computer a
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
break if if those of us who are on
 
02:46:54.429 --> 02:46:54.439 align:start position:0%
remote if we can leave the meeting and
 
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
then re-enter through the same link it's

the Z it's the same Zoom link that this
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
one my understanding will not be shut
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%

little about no cost to

04:00:46.479 --> 04:00:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
they

04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
have okay the time being
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
1:30 I'd like to reconvene the public
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
works and highways committee for a work
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
session with Department of
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation um if you could bring up
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
the commissioner representative Jack and
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
then whoever else she would like to have
 
04:01:17.550 --> 04:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
um who else would you like to be
 
04:01:19.199 --> 04:01:21.149 align:start position:0%
um who else would you like to be
participating

04:01:21.149 --> 04:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
participating
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner I think initially if you
 
04:01:27.630 --> 04:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
could bring up Bill Cass and Chris
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
waschuk and then we do have all of our
 
04:01:31.870 --> 04:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
directors available as well so they can
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves to the new
 
04:01:33.159 --> 04:01:34.349 align:start position:0%
introduce themselves to the new
committee

04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%

list of who would be participating today
 
04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure a couple others will be joining
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
us but why don't we go ahead and get
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%

04:02:24.030 --> 04:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
host has disabled that feature for
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%

when you have a
 
04:03:30.189 --> 04:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
question so who are we at New Hampshire
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
do um you know we are in the business of
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
moving people and um things from point A
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
to point B and our mission is to provide
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
transportation Excellence enhancing the
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
quality of life in New Hampshire
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
why is our work important because
 
04:03:49.710 --> 04:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
really since nothing moves in New
 
04:03:51.149 --> 04:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without the transportation
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
system it directly impacts our economy
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
and so uh first and foremost um our work
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
ensures that people can um get to school
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
get to their health care appointments um
 
04:04:05.149 --> 04:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
and get out to their jobs to earn a
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
living um our priorities you know first
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
and foremost we focus on safety we want
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're keeping the
 
04:04:14.910 --> 04:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
system safe um for all you users but
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
then also uh that we're keeping our own
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
employees as well as the contractors
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
that work on our assets safe as well we
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
want to have a well-maintained reliable
 
04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
system and we want to function as
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
efficiently as we can stretching the
 
04:04:31.149 --> 04:04:31.159 align:start position:0%
value of every dollar that we're
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
provided uh by the
 
04:04:36.269 --> 04:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
legislature this is how we're structured
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh we have three Commissioners um myself
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have our assistant commissioner
 
04:04:40.800 --> 04:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
uh we have our assistant commissioner
Bill

04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
Cass Bill's also our chief engineer
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
which means that he oversees all things
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
Highway related both project development
 
04:04:51.070 --> 04:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
as well as operations and then our
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Chris wjuk who
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
oversees um Finance policy
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
Administration as well as the division
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
of Aeronautics Rail and Transit so we
 
04:05:03.830 --> 04:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
are a multimodal
 
04:05:06.910 --> 04:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
DOT because we maintain the state
 
04:05:09.149 --> 04:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
highways certainly we have a lot more
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
staff focused on uh both the operations
 
04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
of our roadways as well as design and
 
04:05:17.469 --> 04:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
construction but we work very closely
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
with all of the airports in the state
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
with the railroad operators and also
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
with the public transit agencies and in
 
04:05:27.309 --> 04:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
every project that we advance on the
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
highway system we're always looking at
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
multimodal connections and making sure
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
that we're accommodating bicycles and
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
pedestrians as well as Motor
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
Vehicles project development is made up
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
of all of our technical uh disciplines
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so um our bridge design folks
 
04:05:48.670 --> 04:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
Highway design environment and
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
construction teams all report to our
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
director of project development and
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
while this uh org chart that's on the
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
screen makes it look like we're all
 
04:05:59.429 --> 04:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
quite siloed we've worked very hard as a
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
leadership team to make the organization
 
04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
as horizontal as possible um so for
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
example the folks in environment and
 
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
materials and research collaborate and
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
work closely with those in operations um
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
our Aeronautics Rail and Transit folks
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
or also involved in a number of our work
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
groups and so um we're trying to share
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
the expertise across the
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
department but today we really want to
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
introduce you to that leadership team um
 
04:06:26.189 --> 04:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
so heading up all of these different
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
sections um we have as I mentioned the
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners and then our
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
directors who I believe are on the line
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
um Marie Mullen is our Director of
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
Finance Brown bazinsky is our director
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
of policy and administration P Hurley
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
who you'll see often before this
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee is um our director for Erin
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit Dave rodrig is our
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
director of operations and his assistant
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
is Mike citus and then for project
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
development we have Pete stamis and his
 
04:06:56.670 --> 04:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
assistant bill oldenberg um Pete will be
 
04:06:59.149 --> 04:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
very familiar to this committee um
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
because next year when we work on the
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
10year plan together um Pete is the one
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
that leads the 10-year plan effort we
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
have a project manager within our
 
04:07:10.750 --> 04:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
planning and Community Assistance Bureau
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
but Pete is always the person who goes
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
out and um presents at the public
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
hearings across the state in the gaset
 
04:07:19.469 --> 04:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
phase of the 10e plan and then will come
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
with us to all of the meetings that we
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
have before this committee and there's
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
two other people who are not on here um
 
04:07:28.590 --> 04:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
Eileen meany is our public information
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
officer and so when there's winter
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
weather or accidents out in the highway
 
04:07:36.189 --> 04:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
you'll probably see Eileen on WMUR or
 
04:07:38.670 --> 04:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be quotes from her as our PI um
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
when there's news coverage uh concerning
 
04:07:42.590 --> 04:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
the department and then a person who's
 
04:07:45.389 --> 04:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
really intrical to team is Kathy um M
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
hson I referenced her earlier she is our
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
hearings examiner but she's also our
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
liaison to the legislature um so we'll
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
make sure to share her contact
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
information anytime you need something
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
from the Department you go straight to
 
04:08:02.349 --> 04:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
Kathy she will uh make sure that we meet
 
04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
your expectations in terms of getting
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
the information you might need and then
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
the last person who's on here is Nick
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
Alexander who heads up um what we call
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
amps but really it's our um asset
 
04:08:16.269 --> 04:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
Management Group and um he works
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
directly with the Commissioners you know
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day I mentioned how
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
our priorities are state of good repair
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
and safety um we are in the business of
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining assets and trying to extend
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
the life expectancy of those assets and
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
so we've done a lot of work um to help
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
support the 10-year plan and the
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
legislature as you're making investment
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
choices in what the future condition of
 
04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
our assets might be with different
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
levels of investment what outcomes you
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
can expect if we advance the projects
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
that are being programmed through the
 
04:08:50.030 --> 04:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so the amps group are
 
04:08:55.469 --> 04:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
really our data um uh collectors and uh
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing all the an analysis so
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
that we can come to you um and give you
 
04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
accurate information on what you can
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
expect based on the choices that you're
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
making from a policy
 
04:09:06.990 --> 04:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
perspective and the most important thing
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the day is the phone number at the
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
bottom of the screen um if you call that
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
number that goes straight through to the
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office um and that's how
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
you can get in touch with any of the
 
04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:21.389 --> 04:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
directors again for the benefit of the
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
new committee members in particular we
 
04:09:24.750 --> 04:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about
 
04:09:28.670 --> 04:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
um the assets that do is responsible for
 
04:09:31.790 --> 04:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
um we are a large organization uh we
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
have around 1650 permanent full-time
 
04:09:37.149 --> 04:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
employees we then in addition have a
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
number of part-time employees especially
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
in turnpikes where we have part-time
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
toll attendance and others to support
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
Mission and then we also hire a number
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
of seasonal employees especially in the
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
summer months to support our summer
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
construction and operations
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
programs as a department we're
 
04:09:56.830 --> 04:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for um
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
2161 State Bridges um you'll hear us
 
04:10:03.309 --> 04:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
talk about the red list often again for
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
the new members a red list bridge is one
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
that is approaching uh the end of its
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
life um technically it means that one of
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
the elements has been rated a four when
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
we've gone out to do an inspection so
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
these bridges are safe we inspect them
 
04:10:19.030 --> 04:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
more frequently if they're on the Red
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
List um but it does mean that uh we need
 
04:10:25.229 --> 04:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
to start to advance a project to either
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
fully replace that structure or do a
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
major um Rehabilitation and so uh when
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
we get into the 10year plan we'll talk a
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
lot about what percentage of our bridges
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
are on the Red List in other words what
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
percentage are structurally deficient
 
04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
and need attention sooner rather than
 
04:10:44.189 --> 04:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
later and then uh we also are
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for inspecting both our
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
state Bridges as well as the municipal
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
Bridges and we do have some funding to
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
support uh work on Municipal Bridges and
 
04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
um in total um there's about, 16 90
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal bridges that we inspect as I
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know we inspect red lless
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
Bridges much more frequently it's
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
approximately every six months uh
 
04:11:12.269 --> 04:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
because they are um older structures in
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
many cases that need attention um and
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of the in uh the inventory we
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
inspect every two
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
years on the highway side um we are
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for approximately 4600
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
center lane miles of Highway um we are
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
responsible uh for all of the routine
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance although it can be a little
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
confusing um there's some roads that we
 
04:11:37.469 --> 04:11:37.479 align:start position:0%
winter maintain other roads that we
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
summer maintain and so depending on
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
which Community we're working with um
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
the the role of the department might
 
04:11:48.189 --> 04:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
vary slightly some of this is just due
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
to plow roots for example and making
 
04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we're operating as efficiently
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
as possible so we collaborate very
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
closely with the towns um on both uh the
 
04:12:00.269 --> 04:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
roads that we fully own and operate as
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
well as the ones where we um have shared
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and basically if you
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
think of it you know pavement lasts
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 years so our goal is
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
always to resurface annually about 500
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
50 center lane miles um so that we can
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
keep our infrastructure in a good state
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
of repair and you'll hear a little bit
 
04:12:22.389 --> 04:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
later on that that level of investment
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
has not always been made which is why um
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
at different times the condition of our
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure has
 
04:12:30.750 --> 04:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
deteriorated and then of course out on
 
04:12:32.070 --> 04:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
the highways we don't just have the
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
pavement itself to maintain there's all
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
the other roadside features from traffic
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
signs line striping all of the traffic
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
signals um not to mention drainage
 
04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
structures and ditch lines and so
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of additional assets that
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
we are responsible
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
for but as I mentioned we're not just
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
the highway department we are the
 
04:12:55.469 --> 04:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
multimodal do and so we also have 195
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
miles of
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
state-owned active rail line um we have
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
a number of operating agreements
 
04:13:08.109 --> 04:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
um who use those Rail lines um we also
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
work with the 25 public use airports um
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
and then the 11 public transit systems
 
04:13:17.550 --> 04:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
and so when we work together with this
 
04:13:20.109 --> 04:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
committee on the 10-year plan we're not
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
just prioritizing which projects um we
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
want to do in terms of new construction
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
on our highways we're talking about the
 
04:13:30.109 --> 04:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
federal funds that support our airports
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
and our public transit systems as
 
04:13:35.710 --> 04:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
well and so this is how the budget
 
04:13:38.429 --> 04:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
breaks down um just to give you a sense
 
04:13:41.070 --> 04:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
of how much we spend every year um in
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
2020 our actual expenditures were around
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
681 million we like to split our budget
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
into these two different segments of the
 
04:13:53.149 --> 04:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
pie um the blue part is really Municipal
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
Aid and construction that's the spending
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
associated with all the projects that uh
 
04:14:00.750 --> 04:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
you help program in the 10year plan and
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
so while all of the money flows through
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
our budget um when we are working with
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
House and Senate Finance on um the
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
budget process it's really addressing
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
this Orange segment um the choices and
 
04:14:17.790 --> 04:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
the investment um tradeoffs Are All Made
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
during the 10-year plan and then we just
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
plug those numbers into our budget so
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
the split about 419 million goes to
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal a and construction and then
 
04:14:30.910 --> 04:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
our operating costs um last year were
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
around 262 million one of the most
 
04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
challenging things for this committee um
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
to start to get up to speed on is the
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
various funding sources um so not only
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
do we have federal and state sources
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
um we also have a Turnpike system here
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so every dollar we
 
04:14:49.469 --> 04:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
collect on the turnpike system can only
 
04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
be spent on the assets that are part of
 
04:14:52.640 --> 04:14:53.590 align:start position:0%
be spent on the assets that are part of
that

04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:56.109 --> 04:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and then on the federal side
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different categories of
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
federal money and so when we collaborate
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
and work on the 10-year plan um I like
 
04:15:04.750 --> 04:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
to say we're not prioritizing all of New
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Transportation needs um
 
04:15:09.149 --> 04:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
globally we are trying to make
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
priorities and rank projects within
 
04:15:13.630 --> 04:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
different categories based on on what
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
color of money they might be eligible
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
for and so next year we'll do the Deep
 
04:15:22.030 --> 04:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
dive and we have um a lot of acronyms uh
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
and a crosswalk to all of those
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
abbreviations so that um you'll have all
 
04:15:29.309 --> 04:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
the information you need uh to help us
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
come up with the next 10e
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
plan um so again you know this is just
 
04:15:37.710 --> 04:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
more of a deeper dive on the Aeronautics
 
04:15:40.590 --> 04:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit division um I mentioned
 
04:15:42.990 --> 04:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
previously we work with all of the
 
04:15:45.309 --> 04:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
airports that are open to the public um
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
we do all of the runway inspections and
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of the Federal Aviation dollars
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
the FAA dollars flow through the
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
department um we um also administer a
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
number of the grants so we work with the
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
three commercial airports um that's
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh Lebanon and peas um and
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
then there are nine airports that are
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
what we call block grant airports so
 
04:16:11.550 --> 04:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
basically New Hampshire's a block grant
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
state that means that there's a lot of
 
04:16:14.790 --> 04:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
FAA functions that are actually
 
04:16:18.109 --> 04:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
performed by um the Department of
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
Transportation um unlike some other
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
states where things are administered in
 
04:16:24.910 --> 04:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
a little different way um we do have
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
some airports that do not qualify for
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
federal assistance um and that's where
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh State funding um is more heavily
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
relied upon um and then lastly we do
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to register all of the aircraft in
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
the state and um we do collect aircraft
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
registration fees um that are then used
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
to make investments in the airports as
 
04:16:49.229 --> 04:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
well on the rail side um I mentioned
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
before that we do have active state
 
04:16:54.389 --> 04:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
owned track um we have six Active
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
operating agreements um four for freight
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
lines and two um tourist lines and um in
 
04:17:04.149 --> 04:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
addition to the active Rail lines we
 
04:17:06.750 --> 04:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
also have a lot of corridors that were
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
formerly um
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
railroad uh corridors but have recently
 
04:17:12.479 --> 04:17:14.229 align:start position:0%
railroad uh corridors but have recently
um

04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:17.710 --> 04:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
been converted into uh rail Trails or
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
recreational use um because the railroad
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
um active rail use was either
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
discontinued or the section were
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
abandoned so um we work very closely
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
with our colleagues over in the
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
department of natural and cultural
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
resources specifically in the Bureau of
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
Trails um because they often have the
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
operating agreements for the corridors
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
own and then lastly uh the public
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
transit um agencies um there's a lot of
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
different categories of federal funding
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
that's um allocated to New Hampshire
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
through the Federal Transit
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
Administration we basically split things
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
into small urban and rural providers and
 
04:18:03.149 --> 04:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
so we work with a total of 11 uh public
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
transit systems and um we also are very
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
involved in um the services to seniors
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
and folks with disabilities um
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
and there's funding provided for Human
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
Service and volunteer driver programs um
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
and then we also um as a
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
department uh fund and then have an
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
operating agreement U to provide the
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
Boston express bus service that connects
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh down to Boston um that
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
service uh runs along the 93 Corridor as
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
well as um the F Everett onto the route
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
three Corridor in Massachusetts
 
04:18:43.439 --> 04:18:44.349 align:start position:0%
three Corridor in Massachusetts
and

04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
um that service is a great success um we
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
pre- pandemic um we had very high
 
04:18:53.149 --> 04:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
ridership and a very low subsidy so it's
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
a service that we're particularly proud
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
of and later on today we'll talk a
 
04:18:59.149 --> 04:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
little bit about how the pandemic has
 
04:19:01.469 --> 04:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
impacted the department as a whole but
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
certainly our Federal
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
Transit um agency uh partners and the
 
04:19:10.269 --> 04:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
Federal Aviation um folks have been
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
trying to support the state dos and the
 
04:19:14.590 --> 04:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
the car's act funding has gone a long
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
way to helping um all of the modes of
 
04:19:20.510 --> 04:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
transportation during this
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
time and so Administration wise um you
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
know the executive office consists of
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and the directors um
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
and in our budget you'll see all of the
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
money for sort of agency-wide
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
programs um and then uh of course as I
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned before you know all of the
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
public Outreach and um coordination with
 
04:19:44.429 --> 04:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
the leg legislature and the governor's
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
office is managed through our executive
 
04:19:50.830 --> 04:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
team Finance uh you know we won't come
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
before this committee often to talk
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
about the details of the operating
 
04:19:58.830 --> 04:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
budget um although um as we work on both
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
hb1 and hb2 we'll make sure to keep this
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
committee apprised of any language in
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 that might um impact how we advance
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
the projects that you then help us
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
program in the 10year plan and um we do
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
look forward to collaborating we work on
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
hb25 and the capital budget together and
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
then lastly policy and administration um
 
04:20:21.790 --> 04:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
as the name would suggest um our Bureau
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
of HR is uh within this section um but
 
04:20:26.910 --> 04:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
then we also have all of our health and
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
safety staff um our office of federal
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
labor compliance um as well as uh our
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
internal audit section um as all part of
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
the division of policy Administration so
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
really they the backbone of the
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
department making sure that we're doing
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
everything everything consistently and
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
efficiently so at this point I'm going
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
to pause and turn it over to Bill Cass
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned earlier as assistant
 
04:20:56.469 --> 04:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner he oversees both the um
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
division of project development as well
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
as operations and so he's really GNA uh
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
start by digging into the municipal Aid
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
and construction part of the budget and
 
04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
um the roles of the folks in project
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
development uh then he'll talk a little
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
bit about operations and then we'll have
 
04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
Chris talk about um the funding and
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
how things are looking as we go into
 
04:21:23.349 --> 04:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
mute thank you commissioner chairman
 
04:21:33.309 --> 04:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
Graham and the rest of uh how public
 
04:21:35.790 --> 04:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
works very good to see everybody um I
 
04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
think commissioner you have uh you have
 
04:21:39.109 --> 04:21:39.119 align:start position:0%
the control of the thing the
 
04:21:40.630 --> 04:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
presentation so I'll just ask you to
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
advance but um and if it and at the
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
chair's uh discretion as we're going
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
through this information uh if there are
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
any questions and we want to stop and
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
pause and ask uh ask any um ask any
 
04:21:55.389 --> 04:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
questions that we can answer uh during
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
the presentation um I I I presume that
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
would be all right as well too but uh
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're at a little pause here are there
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
any questions before we move ahead um no
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate that the members of the
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee please raise your hand so we
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
can know don't just jump in I would
 
04:22:12.159 --> 04:22:14.149 align:start position:0%
can know don't just jump in I would
appre

04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
appre
 
04:22:16.269 --> 04:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
good thank you so yeah so as the
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner said um I was going to talk
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
first about the municipal Aid and
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
construction half of our budget it's uh
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
actually more than half as you can see
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
by the uh Pi there the 2020 expenditures
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
were about $419
 
04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
million um and at the bottom of that
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
slide I just uh you can see that the
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
majority of the funding that comes for
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
the municipal Aid and construction is
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
from the federal program and the
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system they're very little
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
Highway funds uh uh and other in general
 
04:22:48.189 --> 04:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
funds in there so it's predominantly the
 
04:22:51.389 --> 04:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
federal funds uh the turnpike uh
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
primarily the turnik Capital Money uh
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
that comes through and uh a lot of it is
 
04:23:00.269 --> 04:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
kind of flow through it flows through
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Department's budget but it goes out
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
to contractors it goes out to
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities it goes out to you know
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
support the economy and um all those act
 
04:23:13.109 --> 04:23:13.119 align:start position:0%
activities that are um brought than just
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
the Department's um you know staff and
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
slide so uh administering all of that uh
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
activity and all of those construction
 
04:23:29.790 --> 04:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
projects in the highway uh program is
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of uh Pro uh division of
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
project development and it comprises as
 
04:23:36.750 --> 04:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner had outlined earlier uh
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
seven bureaus but essentially they're
 
04:23:41.309 --> 04:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for you know the planning
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
the engineering and the support of the
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
engineering all of the right of way
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions and all of the construction
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
management oversight for uh the
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
Department's um you know Highway
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
construction program uh the bureau
 
04:23:58.510 --> 04:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
project development is also in charge of
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
developing the 10-year plan the 10-year
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation Improvement plan um with
 
04:24:06.670 --> 04:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
a update every two years and I have a
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
information uh on that in the um
 
04:24:14.229 --> 04:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
upcoming slides but um the Federal
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
Highway Administration program my
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
program uh which really is the uh bulk
 
04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
of our Highway construction program uh
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
comprises about $180 million per year um
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
that's what we get for federal funding
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh to support our uh construction
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
program and that's what goes out in
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
fy2020 um we had advertised about $192
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
million of construction contracts uh
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
some of multi-year contracts they spend
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
spend they span over several years so uh
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
during FY 2020 our Bureau of
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
construction uh and our and the
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
department was overseeing 88 active
 
04:25:01.950 --> 04:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
construction projects with a total
 
04:25:04.990 --> 04:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
construction value of about uh $566
 
04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
million so that's just to give you kind
 
04:25:11.590 --> 04:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
of a a size of the um uh program and the
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
activity um that that's going on out
 
04:25:18.750 --> 04:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:22.750 --> 04:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
please I had mentioned I Mr Cass I do
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
question for the new members when you
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the 180 million dollar of
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
federal funding for
 
04:25:34.830 --> 04:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
highways what what is the state's
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
obligation to match that unless you're
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
later uh it was one of the issues and
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
challenges that the commissioner was
 
04:25:47.149 --> 04:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
going to hit on
 
04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh but um yeah so I let let let her take
 
04:25:52.990 --> 04:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
it that is one of the um long-standing
 
04:25:55.309 --> 04:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
issues that we'll we'll we'll get we'll
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
we'll cover at the end if that's all
 
04:25:56.640 --> 04:25:58.670 align:start position:0%
we'll cover at the end if that's all
right

04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
yes but that's a good point so keep keep
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
that 180 in mind when we get to that
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
point at the end
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so um yeah we mentioned the 10-year
 
04:26:10.830 --> 04:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
plan uh it's updated every two years and
 
04:26:13.149 --> 04:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
just for your edification this is the uh
 
04:26:16.030 --> 04:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
schedule so uh we'll be seeing a lot of
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
activity uh this summer with with gasset
 
04:26:22.189 --> 04:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
and public hearings and next legislative
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
session um the 10-year plan the draft
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
10year plan that's developed through the
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
um work with gasset gasset is the
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
governor's advisory committee on
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
Intermodal transportation and it
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
consists of the five executive
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
counselors um that um all that activity
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's going on next the uh you know
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
this summer and developing the draft
 
04:26:48.309 --> 04:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
plan will will land uh land before uh
 
04:26:50.590 --> 04:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
house Public Works to take up next
 
04:26:54.030 --> 04:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
session next uh next January but
 
04:26:58.510 --> 04:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
typically um you know our tene plan we
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
um financially constrain the plan so
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a wish list um we do a lot of
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
discussion and education about the
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
funding levels that that drive the plan
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
so that we're not making any um
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
false promises uh but that people can
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
you know count on that you know what we
 
04:27:21.870 --> 04:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
contain in the plan will be will be
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
delivered uh unfortunately as a
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
financially constrained plan when we
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
have constrained finances there tend to
 
04:27:32.189 --> 04:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
also be a lot of um a lot of needs that
 
04:27:34.389 --> 04:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh come up and get discussed I know you
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
were talking about sound walls earlier
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
this morning um but those are some of
 
04:27:39.159 --> 04:27:40.550 align:start position:0%
this morning um but those are some of
those

04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
um needs that difficult to fit within a
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
financially constrained plan um and and
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh I touch on it here a little uh
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
chairman Graham and commissioner will'll
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more uh about some of
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
the challenges but we have extremely
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
dependent on the federal funding levels
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
so our Highway program we have no State
 
04:28:03.149 --> 04:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
funds matching the federal program so we
 
04:28:05.229 --> 04:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
um have very little
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
resiliency with that and compared to
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
other states um we are a little bit out
 
04:28:13.990 --> 04:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
of a disadvantage because typically if
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
there were state matching funds it would
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
be a um you know a that much larger of a
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
of a of a program and address some of
 
04:28:25.229 --> 04:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
those uh uh um some of those needs that
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
we can't get to but a big part of our
 
04:28:30.349 --> 04:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
program and you'll see next year is
 
04:28:32.269 --> 04:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
really focused on preservation and
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance taking care of what we own
 
04:28:38.349 --> 04:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
first before um a whole before a lot of
 
04:28:42.429 --> 04:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
focus on um you know expansion or new
 
04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and uh keeping up with just
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
um preservation and maintenance and
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining the existing transportation
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
system that we have really um you know
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
takes up the bulk of our um of our
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
program so uh commissioner can you uh
 
04:29:00.399 --> 04:29:02.429 align:start position:0%
program so uh commissioner can you uh
next

04:29:02.429 --> 04:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:29:06.510 --> 04:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
slide um so this is a again just a
 
04:29:08.670 --> 04:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
historical level I had mentioned the
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
$192 million of construction work that
 
04:29:13.109 --> 04:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
we did in
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
fy20 um this chart just gives the um you
 
04:29:19.309 --> 04:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
know the kind of historical investment
 
04:29:22.750 --> 04:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
level that we have in our system uh the
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
big the big uh the the large uh column
 
04:29:28.630 --> 04:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the middle which is uh which
 
04:29:28.640 --> 04:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
in the middle which is uh which
represents

04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
represents
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
2016 was uh was a year that we had some
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that we had a uh a loan to borrow
 
04:29:41.469 --> 04:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
some federal money to um essentially get
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
out and complete all of the
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
i93 uh work so you can see kind of the
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
ups and downs of of the of the of the
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
program and the level of investment
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's going out there I have uh
 
04:29:57.550 --> 04:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
some breakdown in terms of the of the
 
04:29:59.830 --> 04:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
funding distribution that uh that I
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
won't won't get into but again the bulk
 
04:30:04.990 --> 04:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
of it is federal funding with um you
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
know some various programs uh alongside
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
it uh next slide so I talked about
 
04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
preservation and maintenance and our
 
04:30:17.590 --> 04:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
biggest assets and our big the biggest
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
part of our uh of our program is
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining the existing roadway system
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
and maintaining the existing Bridge
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
conditions so the pavement conditions uh
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
have been a big level of of focus for us
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh past few years and
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
within the 10-year plan we have an
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
average investment level of about four
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
$74 million so when I talked about the
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
180 million dollar program you know
 
04:30:44.239 --> 04:30:46.030 align:start position:0%
180 million dollar program you know
that's

04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
um you know a little more than a third
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
of it that is just going to the paving
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
programs to keep up with the uh existing
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
pavement conditions and um really that
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
isn't quite keeping up with everything
 
04:31:02.670 --> 04:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
so the top chart there is the number of
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
miles uh paved every year and the bottom
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
um chart represents the pavement
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
condition in terms of percentage or of
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
of or or a percentage of miles in good
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
or fair condition so that you can see
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
historically we have not always um kept
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
up with um with the level of investment
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to make to
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
maintain the condition of the of the
 
04:31:30.510 --> 04:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
highway system and the pavement
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
conditions so of of of recent years
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
since uh 2014 when there was a um when
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
there was a um increase in the in the
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
gas tax there was a Senate Bill 367 you
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
might hear that referred to uh in
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
various slides and in various
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
discussions but that raised 4.2 cents of
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
the gas tax that was dedicated strictly
 
04:31:57.159 --> 04:31:58.550 align:start position:0%
the gas tax that was dedicated strictly
to

04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
um you know um Highway and Highway and
 
04:32:05.429 --> 04:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
Bridge work um in this in the in the INT
 
04:32:09.790 --> 04:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
in the near term so um we have you know
 
04:32:12.269 --> 04:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
benefited from that investment um um
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
historically we have not always kept
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
pace with that investment and the
 
04:32:18.269 --> 04:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
pavement condition had had suffered and
 
04:32:21.149 --> 04:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
declined but um conditions have been
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
trending upward with that sustain
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
sustained investment uh over um the most
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh recent conditions so we are seeing
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
some of the um you know the best payment
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
conditions that we have seen in in
 
04:32:35.550 --> 04:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
recent years and it is going to be one
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
of the challenge challenges that we'll
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
talk about later in terms of uh trying
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
to sustain that investment and and
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the roadway and pavement
 
04:32:48.149 --> 04:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
condition at its current current
 
04:32:50.910 --> 04:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
conditions uh next
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
slide you know similarly uh We've also
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
had a a lot of focus in the recent years
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
on Bridge condition and maintaining our
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
Bridge conditions and uh again that
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
investment and that focus and that
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
attention has been paying off you can
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
see um the red line there on that
 
04:33:15.310 --> 04:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
condition M uh essentially um charts the
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
number of red lless Bridges and as the
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned red lless bridges
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
are structurally deficient Bridges they
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
have Bridges considered in in poor
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
condition and uh you can see that in
 
04:33:26.799 --> 04:33:28.590 align:start position:0%
condition and uh you can see that in
2013

04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
2013
 
04:33:30.910 --> 04:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
2015 we were trending in the wrong
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
direction we're trending with increasing
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
um numbers of poor and red lless Bridges
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
and uh I think the focus in the tene
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
plan and and and and on our program of
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
um maintaining and and um focusing on
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
bridge on maintaining what we have first
 
04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
and foremost and investing in bridges uh
 
04:33:55.470 --> 04:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
we have been driving the the number of
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
red lists uh down so the current number
 
04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
of Red List uh Bridges is
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
125 um and we expect a further decline
 
04:34:07.590 --> 04:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
when um when the numbers come out when
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
we finish uh compiling the numbers from
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
from from last year so that's all a good
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
good that's all good news um this chart
 
04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
does show in the future years if funding
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
levels remain flat and remain stagnant
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
that um inflationary impacts will uh
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
will could undermine you know what we're
 
04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
able to do and result potentially in um
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
you know the number of red lless Bridges
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
uh going in the opposite direction and
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
and uh starting to increase but um and
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
that all depends on you know our focus
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
and and and maintaining and sustaining a
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
uh the level of investment needed to um
 
04:34:57.390 --> 04:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
address address the bridge conditions so
 
04:34:59.789 --> 04:34:59.799 align:start position:0%
I just bring those two slides up mainly
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of talk uh at
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
house Public Works and in the 10-year
 
04:35:07.629 --> 04:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
plan about uh pavement condition and
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
bridges and they are really two of our
 
04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
biggest assets that uh I wanted to give
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
the committee you know that um look of
 
04:35:19.949 --> 04:35:19.959 align:start position:0%
where we um of of of where we stand with
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
those so the next part I'll move over to
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
the other side because it's a little
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
less than half I was going to say half
 
04:35:29.230 --> 04:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
but it's a little less than half of the
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
of our budget and that's the operating
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
side of the budget and the operating
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
side of the budget really oh can you go
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
back one the operating side of the
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
budget really uh main is is all of the
 
04:35:41.240 --> 04:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
budget really uh main is is all of the
department

04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:35:42.160 --> 04:35:43.470 align:start position:0%
department
of

04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh Transportation activities and at the
 
04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
bottom I've broken out the percentage of
 
04:35:51.869 --> 04:35:51.879 align:start position:0%
costs there for the uh for the um
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
operating budget and you can see that um
 
04:35:58.470 --> 04:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
that the largest percentage of of of
 
04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
funding source for the operating budget
 
04:36:03.910 --> 04:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
is the highway fund so when we talk
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
about um if we talk about times about
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about funding levels in the
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
highway funding and the and the highway
 
04:36:11.320 --> 04:36:12.629 align:start position:0%
highway funding and the and the highway
fund

04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't necessarily affect as much
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
the the capital program the construction
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
program and stuff but it falls very
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
heavily on the um the operating budget
 
04:36:26.910 --> 04:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
and the ability of the department to
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
continue to uh provide the level of
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
service that uh um that we provide so
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
slide on the oper uh on the operating
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
side um we really uh the maintenance and
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
operations you know a big part of the um
 
04:36:48.910 --> 04:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh Workforce effort is
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
comprised of our Highway Maintenance uh
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
staff and Highway Maintenance Personnel
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance is um comprised of
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
six maintenance districts around the
 
04:37:02.349 --> 04:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
state we have 87 Patrol sections so um
 
04:37:04.109 --> 04:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
you know the the folks are staged in
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
those Patrol sections are are there to
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
be responsive to uh the local needs and
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
the and and the immediate needs and and
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
know their um sections of road that they
 
04:37:17.869 --> 04:37:17.879 align:start position:0%
maintain very well so they maintain the
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
roads uh this time of year we've had a
 
04:37:21.990 --> 04:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
lot of focus on winter maintenance and
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
snow plow operations although it hasn't
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
snowed very much lately but um it is
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
still that Focus through the winter of
 
04:37:28.959 --> 04:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
still that Focus through the winter of
winter

04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
winter
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
maintenance um and they're out there
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing the routine uh maintenance and
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
operations um throughout the year
 
04:37:38.029 --> 04:37:38.039 align:start position:0%
responding to emergency events and
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
hurricanes and storms and flooding um
 
04:37:44.670 --> 04:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
they also manage the district Paving
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
programs in other words the the more
 
04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
routine upkeep and and and maintenance
 
04:37:54.029 --> 04:37:54.039 align:start position:0%
Paving programs are um they they even
 
04:37:56.109 --> 04:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
though they're put out and advertised
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
through the executive office through
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
here in conquer they are uh driven by
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
the um local maintenance District's
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
decisions uh the turnpikes bureau which
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
Chris will get into a little bit um also
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
has a Highway Maintenance component
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
where they Main maintain the
 
04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
specifically the turnike system uh next
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
slide in addition to the uh Highway
 
04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
Maintenance folks um there are a number
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
of other um operations bureaus that uh
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
support the work effort out there as
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
well too so our traffic Bureau maintains
 
04:38:31.230 --> 04:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
the roadway line striping all the signs
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
and signals around the state traffic
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau is also responsible for um
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
establishing speed limits uh throughout
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
the state we have a a bridge maintenance
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
Bureau um which does the routine
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh on Bridges and and really
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
works to keep Bridges as much as
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
possible off the red list um keeps them
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
up so we have again 12 Bridge Crews that
 
04:38:58.830 --> 04:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
are staged throughout the state um we've
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
had a uh we also have a Mechanical
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau which maintains the
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
state vehicle Fleet um which is a lot of
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
the uh plows and and and heavy equipment
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
and heavy trucks that are out there
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
plowing the roads and uh needed to do
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
the work um and while our main uh
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
Mechanical Services office and and
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
building is is is here in conquer out on
 
04:39:26.910 --> 04:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
Route 106 off of shape Davis Road um we
 
04:39:29.709 --> 04:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
do have uh six other garages staged
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
around the state to provide that um
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
provide that Regional support uh to the
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance bureaus and and the
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
activities out there also uh another
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
part of our activities are the fuel
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
distribution so we
 
04:39:47.788 --> 04:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
maintain uh vehicle Fleet fuel
 
04:39:50.190 --> 04:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
Distribution Center there are 90 fuel s
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
sites around the around the state and uh
 
04:39:56.350 --> 04:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
the Dot's uh fuel distribution system
 
04:39:59.470 --> 04:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
also supports a lot of municipal use
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
from school buses to local police to um
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
you know some of the Coast buses that
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we see and things like that uh and
 
04:40:10.590 --> 04:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
the fuel distribution is also the
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
state's uh strategic um uh fuel Reserve
 
04:40:18.830 --> 04:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
as well and lastly uh we do have a
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
transportation management center um
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
transportation management and operations
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau that staffs the transportation
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
management the traffic Management Center
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
you they maintain all of the um all of
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
the uh traffic management networks
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
around the state keeping um you know
 
04:40:39.390 --> 04:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
eyes on the road uh helping uh deal with
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
incidences uh dispatching
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
um dispatching uh Personnel to uh
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
address those issues and also
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining a storm Center uh through
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
the winter when it's when it's
 
04:40:57.788 --> 04:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:00.270 --> 04:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
slide so with that that's a general
 
04:41:02.830 --> 04:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
overview of of the two uh big divisions
 
04:41:05.708 --> 04:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
of project development and uh operation
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense in a scope of
 
04:41:11.628 --> 04:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh who does what and and how we do and
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
with that I'd uh like to turn it over to
 
04:41:16.270 --> 04:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
Chris wjuk the Deputy Commissioner who
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
kind of can who will go through um you
 
04:41:20.990 --> 04:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
know some of the funding uh associated
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
with these activities the highway fund
 
04:41:24.670 --> 04:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
the Tren Pike fund and some of the
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
impacts from from uh the pandemic so
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
Chris good afternoon um gram and work
 
04:41:36.670 --> 04:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
committee members before I start are
 
04:41:39.628 --> 04:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
there any questions um on material of
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
Bill presented for
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
continue okay guess I'll I'll continue
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
so um so the highway fund there's a lot
 
04:41:56.110 --> 04:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
of talk and a lot of um sometimes it's
 
04:41:58.270 --> 04:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding relative to the highway
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
fund um in terms of whether the
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
department controls the highway fund
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
this we like to present this you know
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
first bullet by saying that the highway
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
fund is not solely the do do is much
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
solely tribute to the highway fund it is
 
04:42:16.350 --> 04:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
a fund where the unrestricted revenue
 
04:42:18.430 --> 04:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
from the gas tax or road toll
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
registration are collected but they're
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
collected by Department of Safety so in
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
terms of any Revenue projections um it's
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
really Department of Safety that
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
provides those primarily to house ways
 
04:42:30.160 --> 04:42:31.070 align:start position:0%
provides those primarily to house ways
and

04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:34.270 --> 04:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
means it's also the fund where a lot of
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
the federal construction reimbursements
 
04:42:41.470 --> 04:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
and Gaby Bond and proceeds flow into um
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's why when you when you look at the
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
pie chart um it's upwards of 600
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat million dollars it's because of
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
those Federal inclusions that flow
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
through the highway fund there's a
 
04:42:55.070 --> 04:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
primary source of funding for the
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget like Bill noted um and
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's Revenue that that other agencies
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
also um draw on am of safety draws on
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
the highway fund BMV division Mot
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle official branch and Justice all
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
draw at some level on the highway Fund
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the last fiscal year 59% of the
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
highway fund was appropriated to the dot
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
26% was appropriated to other agencies
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
and 15% flow to municipalities that's
 
04:43:34.350 --> 04:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
primarily BL ran Aid next slide
 
04:43:36.430 --> 04:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner I I have a couple of
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
questions about that last slide
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely for the new members if you
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
could explain what Garvey and Tiff are
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely so Garvey uh fed that's a
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
federal bonding program it's Grant um
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue anticipation bonds um and it's a
 
04:43:58.798 --> 04:44:00.390 align:start position:0%
Revenue anticipation bonds um and it's a
program

04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
where primarily for i93 there were bonds
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
issued for the construction of i93 and
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
the and the debt service on those bonds
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
are paid
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
um with federal funds it it is the first
 
04:44:17.550 --> 04:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
staunch of federal revenue that comes
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
off of
 
04:44:21.788 --> 04:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
our obligational limit um at the
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of each Federal year right now
 
04:44:27.628 --> 04:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
I believe um theave Debt Service is
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
roughly 17 million a year to pay off
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
those um i93 bonds piia it's another
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
Federal it's a loan program it's a low
 
04:44:40.990 --> 04:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
cost Loan program um with very specific
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
specific criteria there was $200 million
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
of of tifia um of the tifia loan that
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
was used again to fund
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
i93 those proceeds are paid back by the
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
SB 367 revenue and that and that um that
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
program was structured such that The
 
04:45:04.190 --> 04:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
Debt Service that was payable on the $
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
200 million dollar was interest only for
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
the first seven years and then principal
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
kicks in in year eight
 
04:45:13.868 --> 04:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
and it stretches out for a total of 20
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
years so um the reason we were able to
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
get such a fantastic interest rate on
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
the tifia loan which is I think a little
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
over 1% was we qualified for that rule
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
rate and we're able to do a lot of other
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
work um with the
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
s367 revenue that we pledged um in those
 
04:45:38.190 --> 04:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
rural areas and it to work on um red
 
04:45:41.310 --> 04:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
lless Bridges as well as Paving from of
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
the tier three and four roads which in a
 
04:45:46.590 --> 04:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
lot of cases aren't eligible for um for
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
federal aid so um The W the way the
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
waterfall Works roughly SP 367 Revenue
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
brings in approximately 34 million I
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be reduced by a
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
little over a million almost two million
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic over the next
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
biennium but anyways for example in
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 19 it brought in roughly 30
 
04:46:15.030 --> 04:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
4 million um 12% of that Revenue flows
 
04:46:18.190 --> 04:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
to block Grand Aid so roughly a little
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
over 4 million flowed to
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then the interest on
 
04:46:24.030 --> 04:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
the $200
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
million um whatever was expended at that
 
04:46:30.670 --> 04:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
point was being paid and then um 6.8
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
million for the state a rich
 
04:46:35.548 --> 04:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
program was allocated out of that
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
revenue and then the rest flowed to
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
tifia pledge bridge and and Highway work
 
04:46:45.628 --> 04:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
so um when when Bill talked about the
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
paving program we're able to spend
 
04:46:51.788 --> 04:46:51.798 align:start position:0%
roughly 1213 million a year in
 
04:46:54.190 --> 04:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
additional money out of this SB 367
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
revenue on Paving that we wouldn't have
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
been able to if we didn't have this
 
04:47:01.948 --> 04:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
program and the other but roughly nine
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
10 million goes to Red lless
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
bridges that answer your question
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative yeah on those it did on
 
04:47:13.708 --> 04:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
the fifth bottom of the the slide 15% to
 
04:47:16.548 --> 04:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities is that in addition to
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
the block grant Aid or that is block gr
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
a okay and I thought that there was a an
 
04:47:31.628 --> 04:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
RSA that set limits on what went out of
 
04:47:34.990 --> 04:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and what percentage was
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to stay within
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
do um did we wave that in the last
 
04:47:41.040 --> 04:47:43.948 align:start position:0%
do um did we wave that in the last
budget

04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
process um I am not 100% sure if the if
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
waved but I'm not 100% sure whether
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
because that percentage because the the
 
04:48:02.350 --> 04:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
block granade flows through the through
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
the department I think they combin these
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
two percentages and that's the those are
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
the percentages they use the 59% and
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
then and
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
15% but the following question was about
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
the 59% I thought that there was a
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
higher um Benchmark for the department
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
to get out of the highway Fund in the
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
RSA there is a benchmark um off the top
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
of my head I don't know exactly the
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
percentage but I I'll I'll get that to
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.868 --> 04:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
so this what this slide shows is the um
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of and it's unrestricted
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
Revenue that flows into the highway fund
 
04:48:53.628 --> 04:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
so this does not include better nor does
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
it include the
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
s367 those two um sources of fund
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're restricted in the highway fund
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
and they have they're restricted for a
 
04:49:04.270 --> 04:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
certain purpose so this is totally
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
unrestricted so this is 15 cents of the
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents um it and it has a 10year
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
look back so in fiscal year 10 um you
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
can see the dollar value for Top Line is
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
the the road tool that was collected uh
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
then the motor vehicle fees um in in
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
this year 2010 and 11 is a $30
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
registration sech charge um and then
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted in yellow are a lot of kind
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:49:36.718 --> 04:49:38.270 align:start position:0%
of the
one-time

04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
um infusions into the highway fund um to
 
04:49:45.270 --> 04:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
prop up the highway fund um during
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
different times of
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
um different bium I would say so you can
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
see there's a there's um the I95 s is
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
included in there that is the I95 brid
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
sale uh for 120 million that the
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
turnpike purchased the high level bridge
 
04:50:08.230 --> 04:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
and um reimburse the highway fund a
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
little it's 120 million plus interest
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
over it was initially intended to be a
 
04:50:15.628 --> 04:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
20-year period but it worked out to be a
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
little over a six-year period um the
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
Retro Turnpike toll credits that's where
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
we were able to go back and get
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for f projects where the
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
state match was paid um and and we use
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh turn toll credits for a short period
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
of time those three years to go back and
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
Infuse federal funds into the highway
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
fund fund um in miscellaneous Revenue um
 
04:50:47.628 --> 04:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
what that amounts to is the federal um
 
04:50:52.030 --> 04:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
federal revenue our budget now um in the
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
first four years there that Revenue was
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
unrestricted and now since 2014 that
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
revenue is in um but if you the bottom
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
line if you look at um over the 10-year
 
04:51:08.190 --> 04:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
period we've gone from almost 340
 
04:51:10.270 --> 04:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
million of unrestricted Revenue in the
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
highway fund to um a little under 250
 
04:51:18.830 --> 04:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
million in the highway fund um in 20 so
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
drop next
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
slide uh this is the turnpike system
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
um most
 
04:51:33.628 --> 04:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
of you know it consists of three
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
segments um Central Turnpike Eastern
 
04:51:39.150 --> 04:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
Turnpike which also consist of fding
 
04:51:39.160 --> 04:51:40.750 align:start position:0%
Turnpike which also consist of fding
andar

04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
andar
 
04:51:44.110 --> 04:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
um so on the the central Turnpike
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
basically is the F Everett and that it
 
04:51:50.430 --> 04:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
extends all the way up to Exit 14 and
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
conquered we have on the Eastern
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
Turnpike both the blue star which is I
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
95 from state line to State Line the
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
Spen which is from the p p traffic
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
circle all the way up to Exit 18 in in
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
Milton um so it's 89 miles long in total
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
172 Bridges we have eight whole
 
04:52:13.868 --> 04:52:13.878 align:start position:0%
facilities now and what's important to
 
04:52:15.708 --> 04:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
understand it's an Enterprise fund so
 
04:52:16.990 --> 04:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
all the revenue generated on the
 
04:52:19.230 --> 04:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
turnpike system must be used on the
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
turnpike system can't be allocated
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere used elsewhere Turnpike
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue pays for the operation
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the system The Debt
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
Service on the outstanding bonds um
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
renewal and replacement work keep the
 
04:52:36.910 --> 04:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
system in good work in order and then
 
04:52:38.430 --> 04:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of Capital Improvements and
 
04:52:41.548 --> 04:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of the flow of funds
 
04:52:43.070 --> 04:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
that that goes through different
 
04:52:45.628 --> 04:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
accounting units we only do Capital work
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
new construction when there's a
 
04:52:50.110 --> 04:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient Revenue to do that all the
 
04:52:53.150 --> 04:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
other areas need to be satisfied and
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's Bond covenants that um the
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
department needs to meet uh to make sure
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
that the revenues allocated and spent um
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
accordingly fiscal year 20 um and
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
primarily this includes um about four
 
04:53:11.310 --> 04:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
months of the pandemic impact
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
there were 110 million transactions and
 
04:53:17.470 --> 04:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
131 million total revenue for example by
 
04:53:21.628 --> 04:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
comparison this for year 19 there 123. 7
 
04:53:23.948 --> 04:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
million of transactions so we're roughly
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
about 11%
 
04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
drop um in those four months of this
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
year 20 due to the pandemic we do have a
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
question from representative Newman
 
04:53:38.910 --> 04:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes thank you for the benefit
 
04:53:41.390 --> 04:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
of all of us and especially ESP our new
 
04:53:44.350 --> 04:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
members could you specifically identify
 
04:53:48.548 --> 04:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
the eight toll locations right now
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um on the central Turnpike
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
we have ramp tolls at Exit 10 and
 
04:53:55.840 --> 04:53:58.110 align:start position:0%
we have ramp tolls at Exit 10 and
meramac

04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
meramac
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
currently we have the Bedford Mainline
 
04:54:00.840 --> 04:54:01.750 align:start position:0%
currently we have the Bedford Mainline
toll

04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
toll
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
plaza the hookit mainline Toll Plaza on
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
i93 the hookit ramp Plaza
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have on the on the blue star
 
04:54:13.920 --> 04:54:14.948 align:start position:0%
and then we have on the on the blue star
we

04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
have the Hampton Mainline toll on I95
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the Hampton side
 
04:54:25.470 --> 04:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
toll and then on the Spalding we have
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
the DOA Mainline uh Plaza as well as the
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
Rochester Mainline
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
welcome next slide please
 
04:54:43.470 --> 04:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
so here's just a a graphic of the
 
04:54:45.990 --> 04:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
10-year look back for the turnpike U
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
fund um revenue and this is the this is
 
04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
the toll Revenue as you can see
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
um the turnpike system was fairly flat
 
04:54:59.948 --> 04:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
Bally at 10 through 13 um started
 
04:55:01.948 --> 04:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
increasing in 14 and then we had some
 
04:55:03.788 --> 04:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
pretty good bumps particularly in the
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
recent past um on the TR Pike system
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
part of that also has to do with
 
04:55:12.030 --> 04:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
violation Revenue that that is is
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
collected and and uh that has increased
 
04:55:18.868 --> 04:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
the years past um as I mentioned earlier
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 we had a roughly 11%
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
reduction in traffic and about 10 and a
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
half% reduction in the tall
 
04:55:32.190 --> 04:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
slide this is a graphic that shows um
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
the pandemic's impacts on traffic
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
primarily this is at just one location
 
04:55:41.080 --> 04:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
primarily this is at just one location
on

04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
i93 between Exit 12 and 13 we have an
 
04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
automatic uh counter traffic counter um
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
and we we've done is we're comparing
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
traffic um for each week of this example
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
began in February uh February 10th 2020
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
and then it extends to January 18 20 uh
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
2021 so for each week um here we compare
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
to the previous year the week the same
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
week previous year and
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that traffic was
 
04:56:20.280 --> 04:56:21.708 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that traffic was
slightly

04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
04:56:24.750 --> 04:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
above um the biggest years levels early
 
04:56:27.150 --> 04:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
on and then the pandemic hit we had an
 
04:56:31.948 --> 04:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
Abrupt abrupt drop um it dropped 50%
 
04:56:34.830 --> 04:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
during the height of the pandemic um and
 
04:56:37.150 --> 04:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
then it came up back up during the
 
04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
summertime and now we're looking at you
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
know roughly at around 15 to 17% lower
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
traffic um at this at this location than
 
04:56:52.190 --> 04:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
the previous year I will say the
 
04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
turnpike system almost represents this
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
to a t turnike system saw traffic drop
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
um at about 53% at its height and we're
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
at about um between 18 to 20% right now
 
04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
so this represents barly mostly
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
happening across the state I will say
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
that does have a question
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely thanks the I think it was two
 
04:57:22.150 --> 04:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
or three slides previously you talked
 
04:57:28.350 --> 04:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
about in a 10% reduction in revenue on
 
04:57:31.590 --> 04:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system from the start of
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
the year I think it was can you tell me
 
04:57:36.270 --> 04:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
what that equates to in
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
money yes um so that that equ to roughly
 
04:57:41.878 --> 04:57:43.350 align:start position:0%
money yes um so that that equ to roughly
$15

04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
$15
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
million sorry was that 50 million 15 15
 
04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
million on the Turn Pike
 
04:57:57.788 --> 04:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
um so yeah next slide
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner so this
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
actually and there's the5 there's the
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
14.9 million for year2
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
so what this slide shows is we have um
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
an expert that does all our traffic and
 
04:58:18.160 --> 04:58:19.470 align:start position:0%
an expert that does all our traffic and
revenue

04:58:19.470 --> 04:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
forecasting um it's a group from
 
04:58:24.030 --> 04:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
stantech it was formally a group from
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
Jacobs when we went to issue Bonds on
 
04:58:28.590 --> 04:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system they did our traffic
 
04:58:31.150 --> 04:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
and revenue forecasting so they have a
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
lot of um a lot of credibility in the in
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
the industry um particularly for what
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
what what are really graded as
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
investment raade type of forecast so the
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
blue line is the forecast that they
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
provided the turnike system in October
 
04:58:47.638 --> 04:58:48.628 align:start position:0%
provided the turnike system in October
of

04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
2019 um and you can see this could at 20
 
04:58:55.350 --> 04:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
and this is just revenue from tolls it
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
was it was slightly below
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
134 million or so and then it grew over
 
04:59:03.230 --> 04:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
the 10year period to reach almost 150
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
million um and basically I think they
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
were looking at about a little over
 
04:59:10.190 --> 04:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
percent a fraction over a percent growth
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
year year-over-year in the out years um
 
04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
The Gray Line
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
shows the most recent um is still a
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
draft projection from stantech uh they
 
04:59:24.910 --> 04:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
sent us the information on January 19th
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
we asked them to update um the traffic
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
and revenue uh forecast for us so this
 
04:59:35.270 --> 04:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
estimate is um it's with a mid mid-range
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
effects and what that means is they
 
04:59:42.430 --> 04:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
looked at um low range impacts from Co
 
04:59:44.670 --> 04:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
um they looked at low range would be a
 
04:59:48.110 --> 04:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
recovery in about three years or so um
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
and then a long-term effect from people
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
working from home um with a certain
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
percentage probably continuing to work
 
04:59:58.470 --> 04:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
from home or at least working some
 
05:00:01.230 --> 05:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
period of the week work we from home and
 
05:00:04.548 --> 05:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
then they had a high range which really
 
05:00:07.310 --> 05:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
looked at a possible six-year recovery
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
with a little more of a of an impact
 
05:00:15.070 --> 05:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
work from home type of um effect um and
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
and they recommend using the mid-range
 
05:00:19.948 --> 05:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
so this is the mid-range um I will say
 
05:00:23.548 --> 05:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
that I feel this is conservative but um
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
in any effect you can see the dramatic
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
reduction in year 20 um it was a $15
 
05:00:36.590 --> 05:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
million um hit on on Revenue in 21 it's
 
05:00:39.670 --> 05:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
a 23 a little over $23 million hit on
 
05:00:39.680 --> 05:00:40.868 align:start position:0%
a 23 a little over $23 million hit on
Reven

05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
Reven
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the 4-year period
 
05:00:44.830 --> 05:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
between excuse me 5year period between
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
20 and 24 that amounts to 71
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
million um and then over this 10-year
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
period 121 million um and these
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
estimates this Revenue estimates are
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
what we use in our Capital model to
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
determine what can be funded um on the
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
turnike in terms of capital work um I
 
05:01:09.070 --> 05:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
know in the past and some of the
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
committee members have heard the
 
05:01:12.670 --> 05:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
department testify on three major
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
Turnpike projects um that were that you
 
05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
know they total probably well over $500
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
million um those projects likely will
 
05:01:25.788 --> 05:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
have some level of delay U because of
 
05:01:25.798 --> 05:01:26.750 align:start position:0%
have some level of delay U because of
this

05:01:26.750 --> 05:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
impact so um just want to make the
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee aware of that and certainly
 
05:01:37.070 --> 05:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
the upcoming draft 10year plan um will
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
have um a level of impact to those
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
projects included based on based on
 
05:01:45.708 --> 05:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
these Revenue
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:51.788 --> 05:01:51.798 align:start position:0%
slide and I believe I'm supposed to turn
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
it over to the commissioner talk about
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
challenges thank you so Chris has given
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
you the overview of the financial
 
05:02:02.910 --> 05:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
Outlook associated with
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
covid-19 we want to dig a Little Deeper
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
um and first of all say that you know we
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
as a department have really tried to
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
step up in support the Statewide
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
response to the covid-19 crisis as much
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
as we possibly could so we have been
 
05:02:18.750 --> 05:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
assisting um with some of the call
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
center activities most recently we've
 
05:02:23.788 --> 05:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
been helping the National Guard maximize
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of the vaccine sites to
 
05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
make sure they can handle the traffic
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
volumes as we move into these later
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
phases um we've also been involved in
 
05:02:35.310 --> 05:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine distribution so the department
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
has tried to do as much as we can um to
 
05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
support our colleagues in Health and
 
05:02:42.030 --> 05:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services Homeland Security and the
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
National Guard and we very much
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you know when the
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
stay-at home orders were
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
implemented it was absolutely necessary
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
to um encourage people to limit their
 
05:02:55.628 --> 05:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
travel as a way of controlling this
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
Public Health crisis and so while we're
 
05:03:00.990 --> 05:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed with the revenue Outlook um
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
we fully understand why these steps were
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
necessary but the overall impact in 2020
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
and 21 um was approximately 70 million
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um we've been working to keep the
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
governor's office as well as the
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
legislature apprised of um how the
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic has been impacting all of our
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
revenues um during the summer months we
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh were very concerned about the
 
05:03:31.628 --> 05:03:31.638 align:start position:0%
long-term Revenue Outlook so we did um
 
05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
in coordination with the governor's
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
office defer a lot of our work um we did
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
not Advance uh purchases um in
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
particular we put on hold purchasing
 
05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
equipment and Fleet that was funded in
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
the last budget a number of our capital
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
budget uh items were put on hold and we
 
05:03:53.788 --> 05:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
really focused on routine maintenance um
 
05:03:55.628 --> 05:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
and there was also a hiring freeze
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
implemented due to the revenue
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and so for example a number
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
of our Highway Maintenance forces uh
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
supported the Bureau of traffic with
 
05:04:04.990 --> 05:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
line striping for the summer season
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
instead of hiring seasonal help like we
 
05:04:09.150 --> 05:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
typically would um so that our Highway
 
05:04:11.670 --> 05:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
maintainers could do their routine work
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh traffic would have the additional
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
resources needed for their summer
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
program um so as a result we lapsed
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
about 38 million um because we really
 
05:04:24.990 --> 05:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
focused on core activities and did not
 
05:04:26.548 --> 05:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
move forward with filling any of our
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
vacancies now of course as we got closer
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
to Winter we were very concerned about
 
05:04:32.830 --> 05:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
capacity um and so again in
 
05:04:34.548 --> 05:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the governor's office
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
we were given authorization to start to
 
05:04:38.670 --> 05:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
fill some of our Highway Maintenance
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
vacancies and term vacancies to make
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we were prepared for the
 
05:04:42.160 --> 05:04:43.788 align:start position:0%
sure that we were prepared for the
winter

05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
winter
 
05:04:47.390 --> 05:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
season and uh you know there's been two
 
05:04:50.830 --> 05:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
rounds of uh Federal relief um the first
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill the cares act did not provide any
 
05:04:56.750 --> 05:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
assistance for um State dos and for
 
05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
their Highway systems in particular but
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
there was funding provided uh to support
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
our public transit systems and to
 
05:05:05.948 --> 05:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
support our airports with Federal
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
funding from the FAA um and uh from the
 
05:05:09.000 --> 05:05:10.430 align:start position:0%
funding from the FAA um and uh from the
FTA

05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
FTA
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until the bill that was passed
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the calendar year that we
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
saw some relief for highway so we have
 
05:05:18.750 --> 05:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
received a $41 million back stop for
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
lost revenue and we're currently working
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office as to how to
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
incor incorporate those dollars into our
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
budget um and when the governor releases
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
his budget in a few weeks um there'll be
 
05:05:32.590 --> 05:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
more of an understanding of how those
 
05:05:34.510 --> 05:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
dollars are going to be accessed um but
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
I really want to stress that the federal
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
funds um whether we're talking about
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
airports Transit or highways it was true
 
05:05:42.990 --> 05:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
relief it was to account for lost
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue it doesn't really give us any
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
additional capacity it's not stimulus or
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
recovery it's purely relief um so as we
 
05:05:52.430 --> 05:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
look into the future there's still a lot
 
05:05:55.150 --> 05:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
of federal funding uncertainty um while
 
05:05:56.350 --> 05:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about an
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure proposal and perhaps
 
05:06:02.430 --> 05:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
stimulus um so far the focus has been on
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
relief we have not seen uh the details
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
um of what um the house and the Senate
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh would support um while the new
 
05:06:14.548 --> 05:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
Administration the Biden Administration
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
has outlined what they would like to see
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
for um potential infrastructure and the
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
other thing is our regular Federal
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
funding um is provided through uh the
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
fast act currently the fast act actually
 
05:06:31.470 --> 05:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
expired last September and there was a
 
05:06:34.510 --> 05:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
one-year extension um but this will also
 
05:06:36.548 --> 05:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
be a reauthorization year so while
 
05:06:39.948 --> 05:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
Congress is trying to um confirm all of
 
05:06:41.788 --> 05:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
the new
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh leaders of us do um talk about uh an
 
05:06:49.948 --> 05:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure deal and stimulus still
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
handle relief they also have to pass a
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
longer term reauthorization Bill between
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
now and September so the docket is very
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
full which gives us a lot of uncertainty
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so we're encouraged as a let talk
 
05:07:03.310 --> 05:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
about additional investment in
 
05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
transportation that will be a good thing
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
but we can't count on those dollars
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
until we see exactly how the
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
conversations in Congress go
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
but uh we are in constant contact with
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation um and uh we're
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
very active in ashto um the association
 
05:07:24.190 --> 05:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
that all the state dos are a member of
 
05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can follow what's happening
 
05:07:28.150 --> 05:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
in Congress as been said many times
 
05:07:30.030 --> 05:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
today we are very reliant on federal
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
dollars and Turnpike dollars Chris gave
 
05:07:35.708 --> 05:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
you a real outlook on the turnpike side
 
05:07:37.470 --> 05:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
so we need to continue to Advocate
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.830 --> 05:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um other challenges um
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know as was uh shown earlier uh our
 
05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
Highway fund our state funded Highway
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
fund um has been seeing either declining
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
or flat revenues this is really ju uh
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
due to the increase in fuel efficiency
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
of vehicles on the road today um people
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
are buying less gallons of gas so
 
05:08:07.230 --> 05:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
they're paying less in gas tax or as we
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
call it the road toll here in New
 
05:08:09.120 --> 05:08:10.310 align:start position:0%
call it the road toll here in New
Hampshire

05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
um and so every bium um we have some
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
tough conversations uh with both ways
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and means and with the finance
 
05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
committees on uh what items should be
 
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
included in our budget um last bium we
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
were very encouraged by the support that
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
we saw but we were still a little short
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
in certain areas one of the areas it's
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
talked about often is winter maintenance
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
um certainly we very much appreciate
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the legislature does not want to
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
fully fund winter um if that means
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
cutting from other areas
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
because we might have a light winter and
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
not need those dollars so we wouldn't
 
05:08:46.548 --> 05:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
want to cut um unnecessarily but
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
certainly when we experience um an
 
05:08:50.788 --> 05:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
average or worse than average winter
 
05:08:52.150 --> 05:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's meant that we've had to go back
 
05:08:54.670 --> 05:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and ask for
 
05:08:56.430 --> 05:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
additional authority to fund those
 
05:08:56.440 --> 05:08:57.628 align:start position:0%
additional authority to fund those
winter

05:08:57.628 --> 05:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
winter
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
activities um and I mentioned earlier
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
last summer we really had to put a lot
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
of our purchasing on hold because of the
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um we have been under in
 
05:09:06.480 --> 05:09:09.470 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um we have been under in
underinvestigated

05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
underinvestigated
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
last budget we were delighted that the
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislature supported both our capital
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
budget requests uh to invest in
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
equipment as well as increase the
 
05:09:20.830 --> 05:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
funding in our budget um but
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we were not able to spend
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
all of those dollars and then in
 
05:09:24.320 --> 05:09:25.830 align:start position:0%
all of those dollars and then in
addition

05:09:25.830 --> 05:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
addition
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
um know we're still trying to address
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
that backlog uh from the lack of
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
investment in the past um so I really
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know commend our Mechanical Services
 
05:09:36.670 --> 05:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
folks they've been doing great work
 
05:09:39.070 --> 05:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
keeping trucks on the road um because of
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
course we cannot be productive without
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
the fleet necessary to perform our
 
05:09:47.190 --> 05:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
activities um and then uh of course as
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
well you know um a season of doing only
 
05:09:52.548 --> 05:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
the essentials means that we end up with
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
backlogs of preventative maintenance um
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we've had some challenges even when
 
05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
it comes to recruiting
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
um uh hire trucks and contractors to
 
05:10:06.030 --> 05:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
complement our Workforce so
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
um across the department um I
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
have really been fortunate we have a
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated team who have been stepping up
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
really trying to stretch the value of
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
the dollars that we do have um and
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
people have been um very willing uh to
 
05:10:23.910 --> 05:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
go above and beyond and try and help us
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
get as much work completed as
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
possible longer term you know one of our
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
concerns is uh as both Chris and uh Bill
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
described SB 367 was the 4.2 cents gas
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
tax increase
 
05:10:43.230 --> 05:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
all of the revenue from SB 367 was
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to the construction of
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
i93 that big widening project between
 
05:10:50.350 --> 05:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
Salem and Manchester but fortunately we
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
secured the tifia loan that Chris
 
05:10:55.470 --> 05:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
referenced um that was a Federal Loan so
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
we were able to borrow it a much lower
 
05:10:59.430 --> 05:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
interest rate than was anticipated um so
 
05:11:02.110 --> 05:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
we saved money in terms of financing but
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
then the way the deal was structured and
 
05:11:06.310 --> 05:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
he described the waterfall um in the
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
short term we paid interest only and we
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
were able to do all this Paving Bridge
 
05:11:11.708 --> 05:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
work so when those principal payments
 
05:11:14.270 --> 05:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
kick in we won't have the same capacity
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
that we've had and that's why the charts
 
05:11:19.390 --> 05:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
that bill showed um indicate that our
 
05:11:21.070 --> 05:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
Bridge condition or pavement condition
 
05:11:23.948 --> 05:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
will deteriorate over time if we don't
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
address some of the revenue needs but of
 
05:11:27.628 --> 05:11:27.638 align:start position:0%
course we're always monitoring what's
 
05:11:29.310 --> 05:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
happening at the federal level to
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
understand what additional resources
 
05:11:34.548 --> 05:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
might be available there um to offset um
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
the loss of Revenue um or the loss of
 
05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
available available to spend on the
 
05:11:42.910 --> 05:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
rural Bridges and Pavements once we're
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
paying interest on
 
05:11:47.628 --> 05:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
93 and then the other thing you know
 
05:11:48.868 --> 05:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
we'll get into all of this in the
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
10-year plan but the federal uh
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions on how dollars can be spent
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
mean that we can't use them across the
 
05:11:56.670 --> 05:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
system so not only do we have the
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
limitation with the turnpike where the
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars collected there can only be
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
spent on those assets um we have about a
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
third of our system is not eligible for
 
05:12:08.070 --> 05:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
federal aid um so we're riant on the
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
state revenues um the betterment program
 
05:12:13.548 --> 05:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
and S SP 367 to keep those assets in a
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
good state of repair u because they
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't qualify they're not part of What's
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
called the national highway system we
 
05:12:21.788 --> 05:12:21.798 align:start position:0%
can use some federal money on
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
um more rural Bridges but we don't have
 
05:12:27.788 --> 05:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
that same flexibility when it comes to
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
Pavements so Staffing wise um it's been
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
a tough year like I said we've had a
 
05:12:35.948 --> 05:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
higher than usual vacancy rate um and
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we've really you focused on
 
05:12:41.070 --> 05:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
our core AC activities um and tried to
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
put off some work um now as the revenue
 
05:12:46.670 --> 05:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
picture is becoming clearer we've been
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
working with the governor's office we're
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
starting to backfill a lot of those
 
05:12:50.868 --> 05:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
vacancies we just had to be very
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
conservative for a period of time when
 
05:12:54.350 --> 05:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't know what the future was going
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
to bring and it's really exciting to see
 
05:12:59.708 --> 05:12:59.718 align:start position:0%
the roll out of the vaccine now um
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
because hopefully by the time we get
 
05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
into the summer we'll see traffic
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
patterns start to return to normal but
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
as Chris mentioned um we're still
 
05:13:11.150 --> 05:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the long-term trends
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to commuting traffic and
 
05:13:15.390 --> 05:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
you think about the successes during
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
this um uh time you know it's been
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
a it's been a very difficult um year for
 
05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
many individuals who um have suffered
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous financial hardship or been
 
05:13:32.788 --> 05:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
dealing with um the loss of a loved one
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
or you know fighting this virus
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
themselves um but there are some
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
glimmers of hope you know the deployment
 
05:13:40.990 --> 05:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
of Technology um and how successful some
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
businesses have been at pivoting to
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
telor and remote work um we believe that
 
05:13:47.948 --> 05:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
some of that will last into the future
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
so between um you know higher education
 
05:13:53.708 --> 05:13:53.718 align:start position:0%
moving to remote learning um the
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
expansion of tele medicine uh the
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
expansion of telework and then a lot of
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
online shopping um those are four pretty
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
disruptive things when it comes to how
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
we um forecast future traffic volumes
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
and understand how people might be using
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
our systems so it's going to be um a few
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
years before we really understand um
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
what the lasting impacts of covid-19 are
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so we're trying to get back on track
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
we've been working with the governor's
 
05:14:23.470 --> 05:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
office to start to move forward now on
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
some of our capital projects um that
 
05:14:29.310 --> 05:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
were previously on hold um there are
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
some Surplus State properties that um
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
during the last budget we were given
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
one-time general fund Surplus dollars to
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
demolish old buildings um and prepare
 
05:14:42.430 --> 05:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
those sites that we could sell them um
 
05:14:44.190 --> 05:14:44.200 align:start position:0%
again that type of work was put on hold
 
05:14:46.110 --> 05:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
when Revenue was uncertain but we're
 
05:14:47.910 --> 05:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
starting to revisit those projects with
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and hopefully get
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
those moving again um and then some of
 
05:14:56.830 --> 05:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that we uh deal with every
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
budget um State matching dollars to
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
access Federal Transit funding um that's
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that uh comes before this
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee because we need the dollars to
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
match Capital uh FTA funds as well as um
 
05:15:17.708 --> 05:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
the operating State match um on the uh
 
05:15:20.708 --> 05:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway side um representative
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
Graham this will speak to your
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh question earlier um so we as a as a
 
05:15:30.788 --> 05:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
department um do not have the funding to
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
match our Federal Highway program so
 
05:15:35.548 --> 05:15:35.558 align:start position:0%
what that means is most of the federal
 
05:15:40.150 --> 05:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
funds are an 8020 uh match so it's 80%
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
Federal and to access those dollars you
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
normally have to bring a 20% match a
 
05:15:48.150 --> 05:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
state cash match um to the table to be
 
05:15:51.548 --> 05:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
able to spend the full amount um here in
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we have a Turnpike
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
system and many of our Turnpike roads um
 
05:15:59.948 --> 05:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh were constructed and our toll network
 
05:16:01.470 --> 05:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
was implemented before the national
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
highway system was created what happens
 
05:16:06.548 --> 05:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
is we get credit for the fact that we
 
05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
keep those assets in a good state of
 
05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
repair but don't draw on federal funds
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
to do so so every time we invest in the
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund sorry in the turnpike
 
05:16:18.510 --> 05:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
system with turpike funds we get credit
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
for that it's not cash um but it's sort
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
of a reward for generating your own
 
05:16:26.548 --> 05:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
revenue and keeping those critical parts
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
of the national um highway system in a
 
05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
good state of repair and so what we do
 
05:16:33.708 --> 05:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is we use those credits
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
to match the federal funds um instead of
 
05:16:38.590 --> 05:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
bringing a cash match to the table um so
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
if you think of it this way if the
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
federal government gives you $80 you're
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to bring $20 of cash so you
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
spend a hundred um what we do instead is
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
we get $80 from the federal government
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
we bring $20 worth of toal credits which
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
allows us to access the federal funds at
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
100% the downside is we only spend 80
 
05:17:01.270 --> 05:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
because it's not cash it's just our way
 
05:17:04.270 --> 05:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
of accessing the federal portion um so
 
05:17:06.070 --> 05:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
basically while other states are
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
spending $100 we'd only spend 80 um so
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we fall a little bit behind
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
um the other challenge is we also get
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
Less Federal money than any other state
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
um uh we have the lowest apportionment
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
um despite the fact that we have a
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
larger population and more Lane miles to
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
maintain than some of our neighbors and
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's a big discrepancy between how
 
05:17:29.628 --> 05:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
much we receive in federal funds and
 
05:17:32.910 --> 05:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
what Vermont as an example receives so
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're constantly
 
05:17:35.670 --> 05:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
bringing up at the federal level to try
 
05:17:38.030 --> 05:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
and advocate for changes in the formulas
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
to make it more
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
Equitable and then lastly uh this state
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
a state aid bridge program is the
 
05:17:46.830 --> 05:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
funding that we provide to
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to replace some of the
 
05:17:52.670 --> 05:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
municipally owned bridges that are on
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
the Red List um or nearing Red List the
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
state a bridge program that was funded
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
with SB 367 so again Chris described
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
that waterfall how there's 6.8 million
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
um that goes to State a bridge um so one
 
05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
of our concerns longer term is once um
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
SB 367 sunsets when the i93 debt is all
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
paid off um then two with the state a
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
bridge program and that's why uh We've
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
really um had to cut back uh right now
 
05:18:24.868 --> 05:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
in the 10year plan we have all of the
 
05:18:27.150 --> 05:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
dollars programmed out um there's very
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
little opportunity to add Bridges to the
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
program before I think that gives you a
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
sense of some of the financial
 
05:18:34.670 --> 05:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
challenges again we'll get into all the
 
05:18:37.070 --> 05:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
detail next year when we do the 10year
 
05:18:41.230 --> 05:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
plan sorry represent question um since
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about decline in revenue
 
05:18:45.230 --> 05:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
rest I know that that probably in all
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
all honesty is impacting the block gr
 
05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
Aid to communities I know in the town of
 
05:18:59.830 --> 05:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
Bedford they are projecting about 12%
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
Less in Block brand Aid which then
 
05:19:04.948 --> 05:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
translates into either doing Less in the
 
05:19:09.390 --> 05:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
town or raising property taxes
 
05:19:12.430 --> 05:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
how much on average are we seeing a
 
05:19:16.830 --> 05:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
decline in Block band eight in from 20
 
05:19:18.670 --> 05:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
to 21
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
say um so when we assign black uh block
 
05:19:23.708 --> 05:19:23.718 align:start position:0%
grant we're doing it in a we're looking
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
at the prior years Revenue so there was
 
05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
no reduction in the distribution in 2020
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns because it was
 
05:19:32.350 --> 05:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
based on the 2019 Revenue we are
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
currently working on the budget with the
 
05:19:36.270 --> 05:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
governor's office right now in a couple
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
of weeks when you see the Governor's
 
05:19:41.070 --> 05:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
budget um it'll show the figures of what
 
05:19:42.990 --> 05:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
we anticipate being available for block
 
05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
grant in 22 and
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
23 I don't have those numbers in front
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
of me today we'll wait and share them
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
when the governor releases his
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
budget but you have a sense given how
 
05:19:55.868 --> 05:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
you've seen the revenues decline over
 
05:20:02.910 --> 05:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
period representative if I
 
05:20:09.708 --> 05:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
may um your question relative to
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
in the rsas how what percentage of the
 
05:20:12.120 --> 05:20:13.270 align:start position:0%
in the rsas how what percentage of the
highway

05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
highway
 
05:20:15.788 --> 05:20:15.798 align:start position:0%
fund was dedicated to the department or
 
05:20:18.990 --> 05:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
is dedicated to the department the RSA 9
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
colon 9 B basically States in each bium
 
05:20:27.990 --> 05:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the department get no less than
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
73% with of safety getting 26% and then
 
05:20:35.670 --> 05:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
1% to other agencies so from
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
our um percentages that we had on on
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
slide 18 the department received
 
05:20:48.510 --> 05:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
74% now I I note that 59% is really
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the department and 15%
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
flows through the department to the
 
05:20:55.270 --> 05:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the form of block man

05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
so so I'm sensitive to time I know
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative when you asked us to do
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
this presentation you indicated that you
 
05:21:26.110 --> 05:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
were targeting about an hour and um
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
we've been together for a little longer
 
05:21:30.390 --> 05:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
than that so I'll I'll try and pick up
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
the pace in these last few slides um so
 
05:21:34.030 --> 05:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more time for
 
05:21:36.070 --> 05:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions um so I alluded to it
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
previously but we have 1650 permanent
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
employees currently at do um are
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
approved positions currently at do um
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
with a significant number of vacancies
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
currently um but really our headcount is
 
05:21:50.548 --> 05:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
the lowest that it's ever been at the
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
department um because while the vacancy
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
rate has been as high in the past um
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
over uh the last uh 10 to 20 years we
 
05:22:04.590 --> 05:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
have seen um reductions in the number of
 
05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
employees um some of that's because of
 
05:22:08.788 --> 05:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
Technology you know we've been able to
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
implement new Solutions and make things
 
05:22:15.230 --> 05:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh more efficient but in other areas um
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
you know we really have just asked been
 
05:22:24.510 --> 05:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.590 --> 05:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
um I apologize my son has come to join
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.480 --> 05:22:40.788 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:22:42.628 --> 05:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps Chris or Bill can speak to the
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
slide for a moment while I uh deal with
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:50.910 --> 05:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
second I could speak to it so on the
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
capital budget side we were we had three
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
General funded
 
05:23:00.628 --> 05:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
requests um 1.6 million to leverage 29
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds uh and really
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
the Aeronautics and Transit matching
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
funds and then also we had um a request
 
05:23:13.390 --> 05:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
to replace our aircraft uh registration
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
system I believe that was roughly
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
$500,000 so um that those are three
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
requests we put forth on the general
 
05:23:24.628 --> 05:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
fund side um as part of this bium
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget on the highway fund side
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
which The Debt Service on the highway
 
05:23:32.548 --> 05:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
fund um side is paid out of the highway
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
fund we had 10 requests uh primarily
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
Patrol and and shed uh salt shed repl
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
placements or or
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
Renovations um a new fuel management
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
system our current fuel management
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
system is um basically um outdated and U
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
is no longer supported by the vendor we
 
05:23:55.070 --> 05:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
need to issue a new RFP to get a new
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
fuel management system for the uh um for
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
the fuel uh distribution
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
Network um we had some critical
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
systems that development um I believe
 
05:24:10.830 --> 05:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of what that was for
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
that's the second phase of uh Wolfie in
 
05:24:15.430 --> 05:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
the work order system okay that's the
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
okay that's the work order system that
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
we're working on and so that's the
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
second phase of that and then the
 
05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
underground storage tank replacement
 
05:24:25.750 --> 05:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
program um right now The Debt Service is
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
being evaluated by treasury for these
 
05:24:33.310 --> 05:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
requests um so I believe the highway
 
05:24:35.390 --> 05:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
fund request that we put forth totaled a
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
little over uh $12 million
 
05:24:43.150 --> 05:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
um we were trying to be um really
 
05:24:46.110 --> 05:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable in terms of um how much more
 
05:24:49.750 --> 05:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:51.750 --> 05:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
highway I
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
believe I believe these these last two
 
05:24:56.190 --> 05:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
slides weren weren't supposed to be
 
05:24:58.590 --> 05:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
included in the presentation because we
 
05:25:00.750 --> 05:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the bridge and pavement
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
conditions um we provided you know more
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
holistic kind of an overall State
 
05:25:09.030 --> 05:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
average from historical perspective
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
this just shows a snapshot um in one of
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
the number of um red L good fair and and
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
and rep phrase that number of rless
 
05:25:24.070 --> 05:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
bridges um Fair Bridges and then good
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
Bridges and you can see the number of
 
05:25:28.910 --> 05:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
fair Bridges is increasing dramatically
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
so and the number of good Bridges is
 
05:25:33.310 --> 05:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
dropping with time um Although our red
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
lless is declining um I think what's
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
happening is through our preservation
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
efforts the number of fair Bridges is
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
increasing because they're going from
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
good to fair and staying in that fair
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
category now lastly the paving condition
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:55.310 --> 05:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
slide this just shows kind of a snapshot
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
2014 versus
 
05:26:00.628 --> 05:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
2020 um where our pavment
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
condition in a good Fair standpoint went
 
05:26:09.948 --> 05:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
from 68% in 2014 to now um 80 3% in 2020
 
05:26:12.030 --> 05:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
so the level of Investments that we've
 
05:26:15.548 --> 05:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
been making um in the system with the SB
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
36750 pledged Revenue um is really
 
05:26:18.798 --> 05:26:20.150 align:start position:0%
36750 pledged Revenue um is really
paying

05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
paying
 
05:26:24.270 --> 05:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
off with that I believe um open up to
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee may have
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
unless commissioner you have anything
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
else you want to add
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
Bill no hopefully this was what you were
 
05:26:35.548 --> 05:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
looking for um representative Graham and
 
05:26:37.868 --> 05:26:37.878 align:start position:0%
uh we went through a lot of material so
 
05:26:39.990 --> 05:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
if the committee members who are new
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
this year have questions of course we're
 
05:26:43.830 --> 05:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
all available to do a deeper dive with
 
05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
anyone who's trying to get up to
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
speed a lot of material this afternoon
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
though commissioner I I do thank you on
 
05:26:53.510 --> 05:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of all of us for for doing this
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
this afternoon it it is helpful for all
 
05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
of us to get the refresher and for the
 
05:27:03.548 --> 05:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
new members to be able to see what we
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
are dealing with because some of what
 
05:27:08.910 --> 05:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
you have talked about will be de with in
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
the in both the capital and the
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
operating budget but it'll also all feed
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
after that into the 10-year
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan which this committee
 
05:27:23.470 --> 05:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
works with on two of those three so it's
 
05:27:27.030 --> 05:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
helpful to at least know who you are
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with and for them to to see it
 
05:27:31.830 --> 05:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
for those who are
 
05:27:36.750 --> 05:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
listening um all of these this hearing
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
um work session as well as everything
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
that happened this morning was recorded
 
05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
and is available on YouTube for your
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
perusal at your
 
05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
leisure um does any members of the
 
05:27:53.270 --> 05:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee J representative clu or do
 
05:27:54.948 --> 05:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
where go yeah I do have a qu I don't
 
05:27:57.510 --> 05:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
know the question can answer the winter
 
05:28:00.350 --> 05:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance expenses as of today are
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
there are your expenses running over
 
05:28:05.190 --> 05:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
budget or under budget I don't know
 
05:28:08.150 --> 05:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
anybody from dot have any idea so in
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
January we went to fiscal committee and
 
05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
we asked for additional Authority um we
 
05:28:15.948 --> 05:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
were underfunded for an average winter
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
and at that time we were trending
 
05:28:20.670 --> 05:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
towards average um so we were given
 
05:28:23.750 --> 05:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
those additional dollars um since then
 
05:28:25.948 --> 05:28:25.958 align:start position:0%
the weather has um slowed down a little
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
bit so um right now we're still trending
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
to an average winter okay people um may
 
05:28:34.670 --> 05:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
not think that it's been a harsh winter
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
but certainly we had one of the largest
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
snowstorms um that we've seen in in
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
history uh back in December when we got
 
05:28:42.910 --> 05:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
over 40 inches in some parts of the
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
State uh thank you commissioner I'm
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
sorry what how much did the fiscal
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee give you again I'm sorry I
 
05:28:51.708 --> 05:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
