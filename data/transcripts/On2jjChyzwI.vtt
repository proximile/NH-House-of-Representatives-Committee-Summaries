e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
so good morning
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
everybody I'm always the last one in the
 
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 align:start position:0%
room I apologize fourth term what are
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
you going to do um well it's great to
 
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
see everybody we're uh well it's kind of
 
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
we just finished our legislative session
 
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
as a lot of folks know uh but here in
 
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I guess the work is never
 
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
done right so we are jumping right into
 
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
the budget process and we always kick
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
things off uh with our the capital
 
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 align:start position:0%
aspect of the budget process um not to
 
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
go into any long winded speeches um
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
other than the capital as a lot of folks
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
know the capital budget process is very
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
different than our uh operational budget
 
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
we'll bring in that process and have
 
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
those hearings as well uh I think those
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
will happen in December is that November
 
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
in November shortly after the election
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
um and as just taking up some questions
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
I received early this morning uh from
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Press uh I think there was a
 
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
surprise that yes we begin the capital
 
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
the capital budget process and the um
 
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
General budget process uh because you
 
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
can't do the whole thing in two months
 
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
uh with with the new um incoming uh
 
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
governor and and administration uh
 
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the Department of administr
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
Services the legislative body all the
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
the LBA all the folks that really have
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
to get involved in most importantly all
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
the different departments that we'll
 
00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
present here uh specifically on these
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
processes um they're integral there's a
 
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
lot to to uh review to analyze to look
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
at both in terms of Revenue projections
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
and opportunities as well as
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
understanding where the real uh biggest
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
priorities needs and even sometimes in
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
the best of times where some of the
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
wants are uh and we can uh kind of make
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
progress on some of the new initiatives
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
that that we bring out capital budget is
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh we start with this one uh it's a
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
little more straightforward which I
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to say it makes it easier
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's still some very tough decisions
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
to be made um the state typically
 
00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
approves somewhere between 120 and 130
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
million dollar of of capital budget
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
expenditures as part of the capital
 
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 align:start position:0%
budget my sense is um that's that's
 
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
right where we should be and that's not
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
just uh from what I think it's it's
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
talking to the state treasurer
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
understanding uh the fiscal uh health of
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
the State uh how much debt we typically
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
take on because this is debt that we're
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
talking about uh and where the the needs
 
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
are now there are always a lot of needs
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
in the state Technically when it comes
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget we're very frugal
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that's always a good thing here in
 
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it does and it has
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
meant traditionally I'd say over the
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
past 30 to 40 years that our physical
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure does deteriorate it does
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
need a lot of Maintenance it does need a
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
lot of upkeep and upgrade um we have had
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunity with uh the federal
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
money that has come in in a variety of
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
different forms both the transportation
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
Bill the arpa funds even a little bit of
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the KAC funds not as much there um the
 
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
December 2020 uh appropriation that was
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
passed out out of Congress these have
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
all provided a lot of uh infrastructure
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
money in a lot of different ways uh I
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
think Charlie uh and commissioner Arling
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
housee and his Department have have done
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
a very good job working with the fiscal
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
committee I think making some pretty
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
aggressive um uh investments into our
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
our Capital um one of the biggest
 
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
Investments you can see is a big hole of
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
right across the street right because
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
the our elas attorney general has just
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
walked in and he didn't walk across the
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
street today um um so we have had some
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
some pretty significant Capital
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the state that's been
 
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
great and and if one of the uh
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
interesting aspects is if anything one
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
of the things we have heard is we
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
departments have come to us and said you
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
know what right now we we have needs but
 
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
we can't take on another Capital project
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
because there is a lot of Manpower uh
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
that goes into that whether it's the
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
Contracting process the assessment
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
process the uh kind of that Clerk of the
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
works managing those projects as they
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
come to fruition um I see um
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner Stewart in the back uh
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
Parks has take on a lot of capital
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
investment and it's great um and also
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
folks have to understand that what we
 
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
talk about today in this hearing and as
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
the process goes on um it still can
 
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
evolve a bit because sometimes you say
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to take on these 10 projects
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
but you know what one of the 10 but one
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
reason or another just can't come to
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
fruition it's a supply chain issue and
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
and we need to Pivot so we always want
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
to build in some flexibility there um
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
given the the kind of tough times in
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
terms of both pricing uh and supply
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
chain that that we still have and likely
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
will have um so uh this year we received
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
requests for just shy of$ 1.3 billion of
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
projects 1.3 billion
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
um it is a lot so we're just going to
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
toss those up and take the first 10% we
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
pull out of the hat and then we can all
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
go home and and that maybe that's the
 
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
the easiest way to do it I'm not going
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
to do that don't worry
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
um so 1.1 billion of that 1.3 billion
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
because this some federal money that can
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
be included in there other funds fees
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
Tech sometimes from places like fish and
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
game whatever it might be but about 1.1
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
billion of that the that 1.3 billion uh
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
would technically be repaid out of the
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
general fund which is the the the
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
significant part of the consideration um
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
so therefore as I just discussed we're
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
looking I guess technically about 10% of
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
the total request uh will likely and
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully be approved through the
 
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
legislature over the past few years
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
we've allocated close to a billion a
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
billion of arpa funds uh in a ways and
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
mostly in infrastructure we we really
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
tried to do our best to make sure we
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
weren't spending our AR dollars on
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
long-term obligations so as we didn't
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
put the state in a in in a tougher hole
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
road uh we had about $800 million in
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
Surplus spending over the past couple
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
budgets as well so a lot of money and a
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunity um have really been
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
been put out there uh and so we'll add
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
to that look again looking somewhere in
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
the realm of$ 120 to $130 million in
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
capital projects through this budget
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
process the en Hamp economy is strong
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of folks realize that
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
I think inflation is is around to stay I
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
try to remind folks that while inflation
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
may only be down to 3 or 4% that's still
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
on top of the 25% of compounded
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
inflation that we've experienced over
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
the past 3 or four years that's very
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
real so in a sense what we were paying
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
for things in 2020 at a minimum I mean
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
in some areas of construction it's well
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
beyond 30 40 50% but in in in at a
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
minimum we're still looking at 25 to 30%
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
increases over what we were paying just
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and and what I've
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
learned is going through all these
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
different projects with vendors with the
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
private sector is there is a um there's
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
a cultural adjustment mindset that has
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
to be we're still not there right we
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
still like to hope that things are going
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
to cost X and then we we come back and
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
and the prices a little higher to the
 
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
credit of dot to the folks at Das the a
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the folks at Public Works I think
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of those inflationary adjustments
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
have been made and we try to put make
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
sure we instill them into our
 
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.870 align:start position:0%
sure we instill them into our
engineering

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
estimates um to make sure that we're
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
we're not over or under budgeting I
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
always say that um some people say oh
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
under budgeting is is okay because you
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
have money left over it's not you want
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
to be the best budgeting is a budget
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is right on target um because that
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
ensures that you didn't miss
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities you didn't waste
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities and you didn't overpromise
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
and under underd deliver at the same
 
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
time um in terms of just the general
 
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
revenues although it doesn't directly
 
00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
apply to um the capital budget uh
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
because these you know we're going to
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
likely be borrowing this money um there
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
is interest to be paid um I think what
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see and and it'll be a deeper
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
discussion as we get into the more
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
general part of the the budget process
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh later this fall but what you're
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
likely going to see is a is a much more
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
traditional level of revenues coming
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
into the state we've had some very good
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
years but I think as folks have realized
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
because of the change in Workforce
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
Dynamics how businesses are uh
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
consolidating and and how they're
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
operating profits are strong and that's
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
good that provides a lot of fiscal
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the state
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh Workforce is there but not like it
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
was and that obviously affects our
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax which is
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
significantly down across the state so
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
while we have had the luxury of of um I
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
won't say luxury um we I think we work
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
very hard to earn our luxury to make
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
sure we've had surpluses over the past
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
few years my sense is that this will the
 
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
incoming budget will be a much tougher
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
budget um I'm not saying losses per se
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
um but we're not going to have the the
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
giant surpluses I think that we've we've
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
had in the past few years uh both part
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
because of our strong New Hampshire
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
economy but also because of the the help
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
and assistance from uh from the federal
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
side on specifically on these capital
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
projects uh so any project that does go
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
into the capital budget um we just have
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
to make sure it truly is necessary uh
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the ongo ongoing operations for the
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
department and agency um and by
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
necessary it could be in issues of
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
health and safety um it could be you
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
know we don't want roofs falling in we
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't want dangerous situations for our
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
employees for the citizens of the state
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
as they are work in our facilities uh or
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
work through our facilities um uh what
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be um the the there's
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the word I would tell all
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners don't don't use the term
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
nice to have it's not a good term to use
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
um we all have things that are nice to
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
have um these are really about needs um
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
for your department for your employees
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
and for the customers uh and the
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
citizens that rely on the agencies uh to
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that that they're coming
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
through um so as again just to go
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
through the the timeline a little bit
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
here uh we're going to start out I think
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
think uh we traditionally have all the
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
different departments come up before
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
over a period of is it two days we do a
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
day and a a day and a half a day and a
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
half or so um we I think we Alla always
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally start off with the
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire um
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
and seeing as this is our fourth time
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
around we're not going to break from
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
tradition with that um that'll be
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
followed by the Department of Justice
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
education the Community College there'll
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
be a small lunch break later on there'll
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
be a half a dozen or so agencies uh this
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then I I believe another
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
half dozen or so tomorrow morning uh
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
right back here at 9:00 a.m. again um so
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is where I kind of look around the
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
room and I figure out did I did I cover
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
what I need to cover you did we're good
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
we're good great and I apologize I
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
didn't introduce uh James Gary um uh my
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
budget director uh for those who don't
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
know James will be driving the both the
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget and operational budget
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
process uh from here until January 3rd
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
or whenever whenever they kick me out of
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
here um because it is a pretty intense
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
process and obviously we'll work very
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
closely with the next Administration
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
either way on both the capital budget
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
and our current and operational budget
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
General budget process uh just to make
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
sure that it's seamless um and um and as
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
smooth as possible for both the
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
Departments and especially the
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
legislator as you know new legislators
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh come into the process uh as well we
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
just want to uh provide as much
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
continuity uh as we can but with that I
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
guess we I'll invite the university Sy
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to come on up uh for
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%

million in the upcoming
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
bium um in 2019 the capital budget was
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
written to provide three bium uh of
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the University system
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
that was exceptionally helpful in our
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
planning and um we would very much like
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
to have that discussion in in the
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
upcoming bium for for three bium I just
 
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%

getting into specifics about the
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
University Systems Capital plan we spent
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
about a $100 million a year on Capital
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
about 75% of that is from University
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
system funds about 10% from State funds
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
and then the balance comes from gifts
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
and grants we have 8.8 million gross
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
square feet of space across our all of
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
our campuses plus all the infrastructure
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
utilities um the replacement cost on
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
that is about 2.9 billion so we're we
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
have you know three little towns or
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
cities if you will that that we're um
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
running and responsible for the state
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
component of our Capital plan is a
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
critical component and we very much
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support and partnership
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
that we've had with the state over the
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
years and supporting our Capital plan um
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
one more thing before we get into any
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
more details um you may know that the
 
00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
university system does not have
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
authority to bond for any of its
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
academic space we bond for
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
self-supporting dorms res Halls dining
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
Halls uh so the the
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the dollars that the
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
university system invests is in fact
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
from our um resources we generally
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
budget one times
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
depreciation for deferred maintenance
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
the um we we are not looking to expand
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
our footprint at all we are actually
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally trying to right size and
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
reduce because our student population is
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
declining um we are are selling
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
properties we are demolishing properties
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
but we also have deferred maintenance
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
needs and that's specific to the the
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
requests that we're making for UNH
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
Kean and honestly with that unless you
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
have questions for me I'd like Bill and
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
Matt to talk about the projects that
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're seeking State support and
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
partnership on so okay thank you Kathy
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
morning Governor sunu members of the
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh unh's top priority for
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
Capital funding is replacement of the
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC system in mors Hall um and on slide
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
six there's a little quick background of
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
Morse Hall so Morse Hall is the home for
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
the institute for the study of Earth's
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
oceans and space uh it was constructed
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
in 1986 it's a four-story building about
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
131,000 Square ft and it's mainly uh the
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
building where where the majority of our
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
campus again we're looking to replace
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
the building wide HVAC equipment uh we
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
hope to reduce operating costs and an
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
important key is we need to be able to
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
maintain temperature and humidity
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
tolerances in this building and uh in
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
order to uh many of the grants that we
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
get require those tolerances be
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
maintained so that's really the priority
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
of what we're trying to do here but
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to modernize the Fume
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
hoods that are in there uh improve
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
safety and functionality and Energy
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and seal up the envelope as
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
well uh on slide eight just gives you a
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
sense of the system we're working with
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
it's 38 years old we're holding it
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
together so really this is a deferred
 
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.230 align:start position:0%
together so really this is a deferred
maintenance

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
project um and again the laboratory
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
spaces that we have which are the
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
majority of this building uh we have
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
difficulty maintaining temperature and
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
humidity tolerances and much of the
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
research work that we do are through
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
federal grants groups like NASA uh they
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
bring teams in and inspect the building
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
while we're doing the work so if we're
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
not within those tolerances the work
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
needs to stop and uh our concern is if
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
that if we can't do that then we won't
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
receive the grants any
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
longer and then uh the budget for the
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
project we we haven't completely
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
finalized the design at this point but
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking between 23 and $25
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
million uh and again to 50% of the
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
research at UNH happens within moris
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
Hall and in 23 we received $100 million
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
in research grants and on average we
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
receive 60 million in research grants um
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
so again this project will work to keep
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
you good morning I'm Matt purcel
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
director Capital planning and
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
development for the University system in
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire going to just briefly
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
touch on two of the projects that we
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
have at Keenan Plymouth uh the first one
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth is the renovation of Hyde
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
Hall Hyde Hall is their primary academic
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
facility on the campus it's the home for
 
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
their Innovation and entrepreneurial
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
cluster um it's the building itself is
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
about 81,000 Square ft and since its
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
construction in
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
1974 uh you know haven't been able to
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
keep up and replace the infrastructure
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
within that building to the point that
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
we've had failures of their uh
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
ventilation systems and you know there's
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
never been any air conditioning in the
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
building and it was poorly in no little
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
to no insulation and uh those are part
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
of the projects that we're trying as
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
part of the maintenance for that
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
building to rectify um it's currently in
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
the process of being renovated we're
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
currently in the construction phase of
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
that project that project is going to
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
extend for another year and a half um
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
some of that is some of that is due to
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
the supply chain other is due to the
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we're we're trying to do this
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
in an occupied building so it makes more
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
sense to do a lot of it as you know not
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
what we call Summers Slammers but more
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
predominantly the work is happening in
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
the building when it's when it's empty
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh the total as I mentioned the total
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
project Bud budget is about $30.5
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
million and um you know a major portion
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
of that is being made up with you know
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh funding from a variety of different
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
sources primarily from the from the
 
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.230 align:start position:0%
sources primarily from the from the
campus

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
campus
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
itself second project I want to just
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
talk about briefly is at Keem State
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
College this is the renovation of the
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
Elliott Center the Elliot Center is a is
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
the former city of Kean hospital that
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
was acquired by Keen State College in
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
1972 it houses a number of student
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
support services and again a a
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount over $20 million worth
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
of deferred maintenance currently exists
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
in that building
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
um and what we're proposing on this
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
project is to focus on dealing with a
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
lot of those deferred maintenance
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
projects um we had originally talked
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
about um redoing a lot of the student
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
services and collecting them there but
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
based on the master planning process
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we just went through we've decided
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
to kind of refocus some of the energies
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
within that building to some other
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
student support um programs than the uh
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
what in there now um there's buildings
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
about 93,000 ft and the proposed project
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
will deal with a lot of the uh failing
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
Heating and ventilation systems that are
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
in the building right now and then also
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of uh due to co we kind of
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
move some of the program out of that
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
building and this project would kind of
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
revitalize some of those core building
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
pieces that are now sitting um you know
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
vacant and reutilizing those spaces
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh total project cost that we're looking
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
at is about $15 million of which we're
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to deal hopefully with at least
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
four million if not more in deferred
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
project we wanted to make sure we leave
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
plenty of time for questions um should
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
you have any and um this is just like I
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
said a sampling of the multitude
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
projects deferred maintenance projects
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we have are ongoing um on our
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
campuses great well thank you very much
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
thee yes because as Matt mentioned Hyde
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
is well into construction and we've also
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
had to phase the Hyde project over a
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
number of years because of the dollars
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
we only have so many dollars so but it
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
is it it is in Full Construction so um
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
yes that's the number one priority to
 
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.710 align:start position:0%
yes that's the number one priority to
finish

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
that um you you mentioned that you
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
received over over the three different
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
bium the the capital funding uh in
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
addition to that I know in the last
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
budget you received $6 million for the
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
for the Center uh for upgrades
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
there could you just briefly explain uh
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
in light of inflation and supply chain
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
issues and things that we've experienced
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
over the last six years uh how those
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
projects are going just a brief overview
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
and what what problems you run into with
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
those so let me talk about the so in the
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
last this past six years it the big ones
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
were Spalding and um bill can talk to
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
that that's almost complete
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hyde was also we also received some
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
funding for Hyde Hall that's ongoing we
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
have costs are higher than we
 
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.470 align:start position:0%
have costs are higher than we
initially

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
um when we initially had the design the
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up but we made a
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
commitment to the state we were not
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
coming back and asking for more
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
money it back in 2019 that any overages
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
the university system would be
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for um and Bill can also
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
talk to status of the wi y so the
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
Spalding Hall project biological
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
sciences initiative that was our last
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
request for the last three banum um it's
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
just being completed now we just
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
received our uh certificate of occupancy
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
actually last week uh there were some
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
budget changes initially when we started
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that project but once we brought our CM
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
on board and got into construction we've
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
been able to hold to the budget uh
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
dollar amount so it it's come in uh
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
where we expected but $95 million um so
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
that project has gone fairly well we
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
have seen some supply chain challenges
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
with electrical equipment HVAC
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
equipment um
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
Transformers as well I mean we do our
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
best to try to plan these projects ahead
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
of time and if we need to buy that
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
equipment early early on just to have it
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh so it's ready for the construction
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
sequence we do that wherever we can um
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
so that you know it's it's still a
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
challenge but that's how we try to deal
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
with it you know project by project
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
basically um as far as the Whitmore
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
Center goes it's currently in the design
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
phase right now so and we also just
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
issued the RFP for construction
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
management services so that's on the
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
street right now as well and we
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate starting construction in the
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
spring and finishing right now a year
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
later but we'll know more as we go
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
through the design phase okay uh one one
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
last followup when when you when you
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
priced out these uh projects uh given
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
that the the first available ility of
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
this money is going to be July 1st of of
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
25 uh did you price these projects based
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
on the price now or what it is
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated to
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
be uh next summer and this summer and
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
fall of
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
2025 yeah they're based on the
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated pricing so what's built into
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
the construction cost estimate is an
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
escalation contingency so we so we
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
factor out into the middle of the
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
project with that escalation contingency
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
and that's included in the cost
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
estimates that we develop
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay great thank
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
you just a brief question the chancellor
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you're downsizing that
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
you're you didn't say unloading
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
properties but um something like that
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
well one next week
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
right actually I think two next week oh
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
two next week um I I wondered if if if
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
your footprint is shrinking on your
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
campuses it may not be shrinking much um
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the back of my mind I'm
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
thinking of the uh you may be aware that
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
housing is a challenge in the state of
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lately um have you looked
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
at I I know there are places across the
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
country and maybe even in our own state
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
where people looked at converting
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
buildings like old dorms or buildings
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
that can be retrofitted into uh you know
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
you couldn't you couldn't sell one of
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
your buildings so operating business but
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
you know housing at the edge of Campus
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
you could convert to housing has there
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
been any looking at that I know that's
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
not that's off capital budget but
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
actually the conversations are happening
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
we're in early
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
stages um possibly at Plymouth at
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
Plymouth we are seriously looking at a
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
number of different facilities there
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
converting that we have on the campus
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
that are some of them are the old houses
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
that we're turning into Workforce
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
housing Another We're actually looking
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
at one of the resident Halls of turning
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
it into a senior living facility as well
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
with a developer oh very interesting
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%

Governor his demands on his schedule are
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
very high and so I I I've sworn to the
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
chief of staff that I keep him on his
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
schedule so the governor has to leave
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
attorney general and I'm joined here
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
this morning by David portal he's our it
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
manager he's going to take the lead on
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
this presentation but I'll just I'll
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
start us off um first of all let me just
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
assure you that we are not looking for a
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
new build building or anything related
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
to construction lest we be thrown out
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
after the first 30 seconds uh we are
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
here requesting funding for a new case
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
management system and David will will
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
explain that but but our case management
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
system is what we use in the Department
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
of Justice really in many ways to run
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
our lives to to store documents um to to
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively on projects to
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
segment off cases the way they should be
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
segmented off to wall people off from
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
cases they shouldn't have access to and
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
to you know to allow multiple lawyers to
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
edit the same document at the same time
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
to you know to keep scheduling to be
 
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
able to put emails quickly into into a
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
document management system as as many
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
people know the practice of law involves
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
managing and saving and organizing a lot
 
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
of documents and when we're working on
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
cases with with such high stakes to the
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
state it's really important that we have
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
a good document management system so
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to turn it over to
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
David um just a little bit about David
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
he joined us about a year ago came to us
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
from Florida he's done an amazing job um
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
he decided to join an attorney general's
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
office right before it moved to a new
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
space which you as you can imagine
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
presented a lot of various it challenges
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
if you get a lot of lawyers paralegals
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
investigators and other types of
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
professionals who work in an AG's office
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
to have to pick up their technology and
 
00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
move it to a new place as you can
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
imagine that raises a lot of questions
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
complaints issues and D David has been
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
great in helping us manage that and
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
great in helping lead this project and
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
he's just done an amazing job all around
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to turn it over
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
to him to go through the presentation
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
but I'll of course be here as well to
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
help answer questions um and of course I
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
don't want to be remiss to my right is
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
also Kathy Carr director of
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
administration uh but David's going to
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
be leading the presentation so that's
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
why I'm giving D David the spotlight so
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
with that I will turn it over to to you
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
David thank you very much John um and
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh introduction as
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
well um just to reiterate my name is
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
David portal um I'm the it manager of
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
the unire Department of Justice um I
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
handle the day-to-day infrastructural
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
needs um of the doj in tandem with
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
doit um and I've been in this role for
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
almost a year uh one of my main goals um
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
in this role uh has been to replace our
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
case management system so we're going to
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
jump straight into it um if you can move
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
to the next slide um
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
so first we're going to qualify what a
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
case management system actually is a
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
case management system is a piece of
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
software that allows law firms and legal
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
entities to store access and edit files
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
and information related to cases this
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
information uh can include things like
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
case numbers Personnel information
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes and litigation information just
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
to name a few um the case management
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
system is just a piece of software that
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
interacts with a database in our case
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's a Microsoft SQL Server datab datase
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh that is hosted in uh in a basement at
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hazen drive by our wonderful Department
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
of it um they have expressed to us and
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is a sentiment that we concur with
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
that they do not want to be hosting our
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
server for too much longer because of
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
the potential security risks with having
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
the server be in their basement um if
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
anything were to happen a data breach um
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
any kind of theft of data then they
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
would be responsible and um we would not
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
want that either so part of this project
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
would also include moving our database
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh to a cloud um so
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
um next up the uh case management
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
systems are the main file cabinets and
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh work environments for Department of
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
Justice employees um so this isn't just
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
a repository that we just dump files
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
into and forget about um our attorneys
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
and paralal have our case management
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
system up 100% the time and they're
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
constantly working within it um the case
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
management system has uh useful tools
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
like uh timekeeping billing and
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
Reporting so again just to reiterate
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
that it's not just a place that we dump
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
files into um our Medicaid fraud control
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
unit grants management unit uh
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts and Environmental
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau they all make use of
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
the billing functionality in praw and or
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
sorry I got ahead of myself pra is our
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
current case management system um they
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
currently make use of the billing
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
functionality of our current case
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
management system uh and they have also
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
expressed that they would like to see
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
some better functionality for this um
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
the reporting functionality of a case
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
management system is also very important
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
um specifically for our Medicaid fraud
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
control unit and tradable Trust units um
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
they uh the reporting functionality of a
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
case management system allows them to
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
generate reports and meet federal
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
reporting standards um so now that I've
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
qualified what a case management system
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
actually is we are going to move on to
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
our current case management
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
system so our current case management
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
system is called praw it is a Thompson
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
Reuters uh product um the New Hampshire
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice acquired praw in
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
2004 for $1.2 million that's $2 million
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
today adjusting for inflation um over
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years the New Hamshire
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
department of justice has paid for
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
various upgrades to praw they're they
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
vary in size but for the most part um
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
these upgrades are just to keep prolow
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
running with modern case management or
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
with modern operating systems and modern
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
server Hardware um and between support
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
Personnel licenses and server Hardware
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh the doj spends roughly $400,000 a
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
year on praw um so we have a contractor
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
for backend under thehood support um
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
whenever structural change needs to be
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
made to praw um or if there are any
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
catastrophic issues with it um and they
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
also collaborate with doit to help
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
manage the database um they also help
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
with day-to-day tech support and
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
answering and with answering questions
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
um so now I'm going to move on to why we
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
need to replace PR law if we can move to
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.349 align:start position:0%
the next
slide

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
so simply put and this is the main
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
message we want to convey to you is that
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh PR is at the end of its lifespan uh
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
it's in legacy mode which means that it
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
is no longer getting updates and it will
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
eventually stop working entirely as
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
Microsoft SQL software uh gets more
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
advanced and as um as operating system
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
get more advanced um currently we're
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
kind of navigating Rocky Waters as doit
 
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
wants to um move the state of New
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to Windows 11 um in 2025 and
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's still unsure as to whether PR law
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
is actually going to work on Windows
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
11 um so PR law also lacks many features
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
that are baselined for modern Case
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
Management Systems again prola met the
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
doj's needs back in 2004 but in the year
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
2024 Case Management Systems have gotten
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
pretty Advanced um so these systems uh
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
include plain text searching so uh
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
currently with our current case
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
management system if we wanted to look
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
up um all documents that had the word
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
giraffe in them for example uh we can't
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
do that um prologist doesn't allow you
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
to do that whereas modern case
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
management systems do uh in fact we have
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
to pay for an additional piece of
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
software from another vendor in order to
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
give us that functionality um prola also
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
lacks eisc Discovery tools um and it
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
also lacks the ability to share cases
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
with outside Council and share limited
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
database access with outside Council um
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that's enough about prola um let's
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
move on to uh the benefits of a new case
 
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.470 align:start position:0%
move on to uh the benefits of a new case
management

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
system so a new case management system
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
would result in increased workflow
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
efficiency for doj employees um these
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
newer case management systems such as e
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor prosecutor by carpel and
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
legal file
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
um they all include built-in workflow
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
management tools um with such as inapp
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
messaging and automated workflow
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions so for example if there's a a
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
claims process going on um there's
 
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
automated tools to move that claim along
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
to who it needs to go to and we don't
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
have to be emailing documents uh back
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
and forth within each other and with um
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
outside Council
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
um an additional uh benefit would be
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
enhanced database security so um like I
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned before we would be moving this
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
new uh database over to um a government
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
Cloud uh this would be a Fed ramp and
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
state ramp um certified Cloud it's not
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
just some random server that we picked
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
off somewhere random um so doit would no
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
longer have to worry about maintaining
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
the security of our database uh which is
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
a huge Plus for them we again we
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
currently pay doit for um database
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
hardware and for maintenance of that
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
database um the costs of
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to get into this
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
later but the costs of um a hosted
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
solution as opposed to paying do for
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
this solution they'd be roughly the same
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
anyway um and then another um another
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
benefit to a new case management system
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
would be the potential to cut other
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
software from our budget like I
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh we pay for certain
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
pieces of software like um perceptive
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
search um and we pay for another piece
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
of software called everlaw for ecovery
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh and we pay a not insignificant amount
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
of money for them um we could
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
potentially cut those pieces of software
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
out of our budget if um we were to get a
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
newer more robust case management system
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
that has those features baked into it um
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to get on to the part
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
that you are all interested in which is
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of a new case management system
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
um so the doj estimates uh roughly $2.2
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
million for a completely new cloud-based
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
case management system uh this includes
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
initial implementation from a vendor and
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh 3 years of startup support so that
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
includes uh training testing maintenance
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
um and user licenses as well um this
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
would also include a database transfer
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
of 20 years of case history um moving a
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
200 terabyte database from um theit's
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
basement to a Cloud Server uh is not a
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
small undertaking at all um so we would
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
be paying for for the amount of work
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
required in that as well um so this is
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
consistent with what other state AG's
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
offices have paid for their case
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
management systems and um storage will
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
likely on the high end cost about
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
$223,200 per year but there is room for
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
lowering it as um if we go with a hosted
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
solution we could archive certain pieces
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
of data so let's say if we have cases
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
from 2004 2005 that we know we're not
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to need we can just archive those
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
cases and pay a fraction of the money
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
for for the amount of space that they
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
take up on the database um and
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
year-to-year costs to maintain the
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
system are estimated to be the same as
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
PR law maintenance which um as I said
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
before was uh about $400 a year it it
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
varies depending on if we need uh have a
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
major upgrade implemented or not um and
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
that is it for us um if any of you have
 
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
that is it for us um if any of you have
any

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you uh two two quick
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
questions uh one is what is the average
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
or the expected useful life for the
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
project and the second is what is the
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
total of Maintenance you mentioned the
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
223,000 for storage but additional costs
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
right that you're going to need as far
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
as software Manpower things like that to
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
maintain the the system so useful life
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
and ongoing maintenance right so um the
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
projected lifespan I mean our our
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
current case management system it lasted
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
US 20 years by the end of of its
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
lifespan it's going to last us uh it's
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to be about 24 25 years we're
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
hoping that this that a new a brand new
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
case management system will last us
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
equally as long um a benefit here is
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
that um if we were to go with a cloud
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
hosted solution um a lot of modern Case
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
Management Systems have uh browser
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
access um so it's not just a program
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you just install onto your computer
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
you can just open up your web browser
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
and then get onto the um get onto the
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
the software uh which is useful because
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
updates are much smaller deal in that
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
case um so it could last upwards of 20
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
years maybe more I'm um currently it
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
depends on the solution that we go with
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
obviously if we go with a solution
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's been in the market for quite a
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
while now then it probably won't last as
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
long but if we go with a newer solution
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
then there's a higher chance of it
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
lasting longer um and then in terms of
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
the money spent um uh year-over-year on
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
praw um specifically in terms of
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
Maintenance um that that comes in the
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
form of uh server space it also comes in
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
the form of paying support Personnel um
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
and and um we had also had to pay for
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
training as well um and we also pay for
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
user licenses too uh we have roughly 200
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
user licenses that we pay for um I
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
believe it's on a yearly basis okay do
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know what that would add up to what
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
you're projecting that to be that adds
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
up to about 400,000 okay so it's pretty
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
much the same as you're it breaks yes
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
okay that's yeah thank
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
you I have a I have a question and first
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
of all it's nice to uh it's nice that
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
the IT guy at Justice is named Mr portal
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about making a joke about
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
that like you're an accountant named
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
Donna debbit um so I appreciate that um
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh a couple a couple of questions the
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
2.2 million is I presume The onetime
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
Upfront cost and does not include
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
licensing um it does include licensing
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
for the first three years Perpetual
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
instead of annual um no they are annual
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
licenses um so this 2.2 million figure
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
it covers the implementation costs and
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
all support in licensing for 3 years for
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
three years and then what's the what's
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
the annualized licensing cost after that
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
um um it it's going to depend on the
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
solution itself we don't project it to
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
be more than um our our current case
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
management system um if and if it is
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably not by money oh so and
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
like the 400,000 you spend annually that
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
includes that includes the LIC includes
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
licensing and so that wouldn't change um
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
I did these are more operating budget
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
questions obviously than than Capital to
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
an extent and um do you know who some of
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
the big players in this space are yes um
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
carpel they operate prosecuted by carpel
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
we've been looking into that um also uh
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
e prosecutor we've been looking into um
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
that um that piece of software as well
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
um there are also some newer Salesforce
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
based um applications that we've been
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
looking at as well sort of my question
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yes um just everybody around the
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
state is looking at at some version of a
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
case management system and and
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
Salesforce we're investing enormous
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
amounts of money and yeah and I presume
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're working with doit yes most of
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
your operating costs are are uh related
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
to this are essentially transfers to do
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're not external operating costs um
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
we do have some external operating costs
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that we we have again we have a
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
contractor that we pay for support um
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
but that's the only external cost okay
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's good to know um yes and the you
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
said that if the new system has greater
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
functionality which should almost
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
certainly will right cuz it 20 years on
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
it better um there are certain things
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to get rid of um or can
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
replace or or do within the system
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
instead of having a standalone yes are
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
there significant savings associated
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
with that or are they the minimas yes um
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
Park um Kathy do you pi r I think we
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
Pace between 600 well we're going up to
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
$600 to $700,000 a year in a for a
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
software called everlaw which is an
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
ecovery management tool I I don't it
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
will depend on the functionality of our
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
new system as to whether we could
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of that cost we may still
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
need to use everlaw for for certain
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
cases but that's that's a significant
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
annual cost that should at least be I
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
think reduced because prol law just
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anywhere near the same
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
functionality as as ever law that was my
 
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
functionality as as ever law that was my
question

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
good Sher good morning um my question to
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
two questions one is does Microsoft
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
itself have an alternative product that
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking directly with you as a
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
replacement to prolog no um Microsoft
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't operate any case management
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
software to the extent of my knowledge
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
um and then the other question is um
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
what's the project timeline if this was
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
to move forward like how long would it
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
take to you know if this is if prola has
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
the potential of running into issues in
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know 25 with say fiscal 25 um
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
between an RFP and a bid and contract
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
and then the actual implementation
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
what's your overall timeline that you
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
you would need so typically for a case
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
management system um shift
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
um it would be anywhere between three
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
and five years we're shooting for five
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
just to be entirely realistic um ideally
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
we would like to get this up and running
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
sooner but um currently 5 years is the
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
timeline and and just to clarify the
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
one-year piece um and David you can
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
correct me but when he said we could
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
lose functionality within a year there
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
are short-term fixes that can Bridge us
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
I think the point is just that in as
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
short of a time as a year we're going to
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
have to start you know doing some I mean
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
Patchwork for for lack of a better term
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
to get us to a new case management
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
system but it does not mean we will not
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
be able to function and still you know
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
function at a high level but uh yeah so
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
shortterm fixes probably begin within a
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
year we can get to five years though
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
that tape will be okay for a few years
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
so um so if I understand
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
correctly um you know the maintenance
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
costs for prw is about 400,000 a year
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct and then your storage
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
your cloud storage costs are about
 
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
225,000 a year yes so annually you're
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
anticipating spending about 625,000 a
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
year no the so the projected cost for
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
storage so with the $400,000 figure uh
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
that is what we currently pay for a
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
current case management system and that
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
includes the server the servers that we
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
have at doit um with a new case
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
management system we would have to pay
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
for for maintenance for um for licenses
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
and all that um but in addition to that
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
we'd have to pay for the cloud storage
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
um in doing so we' wouldd be getting rid
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
of the servers at doit so we would no
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
longer have to pay for those servers but
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
we would now have to pay for cloud
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
storage space um which again the high
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
end is $223,000 a year but uh if we uh
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
archive a data that we no longer need
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
than it that could drop drastically
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
understood so you're paying for cloud
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
storage with the new system right yes
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
and you're paying 400,000 a year
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
approximately for the new system um so
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
$400,000 figure U that would include the
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
cloud storage as well so in addition in
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
addition to maintenance and cloud
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
storage and Licensing fees in total the
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
package would be in the ballpark of
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
$400,000 a year yeah based on your
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't understand what the
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
slide yeah um so the 223,000 would be
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
what we would pay specifically just for
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
the cloud storage right once we move the
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
the server from theit's basement onto
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
let's say the Amazon government Cloud
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we would be paying for that
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
and you know um we'd be paying let's say
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
$223,000 a year for uh Cloud space and
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
then maybe another 50,000 for licenses
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
another 50,000 for maintenance and it's
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
part of the 400k yeah which I can see
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
why that might have been a little conf
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I I apologize uh what do you expect
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
the useful life of the system is I mean
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
you use prol for 20 years what's the
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
useful life of this system so um
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
we based off of you know the fact that
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
PR law has has more or less worked for
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
us for the last 20 soon be probably
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
around 25 years by the time we replace
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
it we expect this system to also um to
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
last us hopefully just as long obviously
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
we can't tell the future we don't know
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be any kind of um
 
00:50:43.789 --> 00:50:43.799 align:start position:0%
hiccups along the way but if we go with
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
a newer system then we are more likely
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
to see a more longevity out of uh the
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
system as well obviously if we go with a
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
with a case management system that's 10
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
years old already it may only last US 10
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
to 15 years um so um we have to use our
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
judgment in that case and and go with
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
something that we we believe will last
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
us longer ideally it lasts us as as long
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
as possible um but based off of pre
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
precedence I want to say 20
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
years and uh and then you mentioned that
 
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
you had a a
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
fiveyear implementation plan do you
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
expect to U come back in a
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
future uh capital budget cycle and ask
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
for more money for this system so for
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
for this specific system or for current
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
system so um for for this specific
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
system we we intend for this to be the
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
end all be all um So within that time
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
between now and let's say in 5 years
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
when the system gets implemented um we
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
may lose functionality with our current
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
uh case management system um which we're
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to do our best to try and find
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of way to keep it chugging
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
along but in terms of this specific new
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
case management system 2.2 million is
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
the endol be all thank you yes
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%

the Career and Technical Education
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
Centers um the projects before you are
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
conal applied Technology Center this is
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
a $14.7 million
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
renovation um to include demolishing
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
rebuilding and adding to the existing
 
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
rebuilding and adding to the existing
structure

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
this will allow the reconfiguration of
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
program offerings the addition of new
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
CTE labs and to launch a new animal
 
00:53:34.799 --> 00:53:35.870 align:start position:0%

science
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
program the next project is the msic
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
auto CTE renovation they're requesting
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million for minor Renovations and
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
to build an addition for new Automotive
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
Bays to allow programming focused on
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
diesel and electric vehicles as well as
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
um the Jaffrey ringe CTE renovation they
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
are requesting $19.4 million for new
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
construction of a 30,000 sqt addition
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
this will allow expansion of the
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
existing construction trade programs as
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
well as adding cosmetology culinary arts
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
fire EMT and security and public safety
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
programs and finally we have the Milford
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
apply Technology Center renovation this
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
is a $28.2 million project it's for
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
Demolition and construction of a new CTE
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
space to create new labs and add
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
automotive and Health occupation
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
programming while the schools have
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
submitted projects to the department
 
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
only one has had a vote at the local
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
level that did fail but there is
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
expectations that all projects will be
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
go up for vote this coming year given
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
that CTE centers in the state supports
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
thousands of students focused on Career
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
and Technical Fields commissioner edbl
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
Department staff have communicated with
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
all centers requesting they sharpen
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
their P pencils to cost effective and to
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
work together and with the local
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
community colleges to ensure we are
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
offering a broad range of educational
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities and not duplicating those
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities within the same small
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
geographical area um Jeff is here if you
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
have specific questions relative to
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
these projects and that is our
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
presentation great thank you uh I would
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
just wonder if you could uh you have
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
them prioritized in in a certain order I
 
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you what your
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
methodology was in prioritizing them
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
that way so we prioritize them based on
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
when they were funded originally and
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
they just come up on it's like a 20year
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
schedule and uh just just to add to that
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
the uh the renovation queue was
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
established in uh Department of
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
Education administrative rules that uh
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
directs us to bring them uh in the order
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
of priority in which they're listed in
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh table that's in those admin
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
rules okay thank
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
you I I wonder if you um um I know this
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing thing and it it Dawns on
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
me that um my understanding is that in
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
in January we're going to have a new
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
governor who will likely
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
be have some degree of familiarity or
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
not with the fact that there's a cue the
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
fact that we've been doing this for 20
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
years that there's a there's a schedule
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
and I I wonder if it would wouldn't be
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for capital budget purposes if
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
you if you could do um just sort of a
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
cheat sheet for the for the committee
 
00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:35.799 align:start position:0%
and and for the particularly for James
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
to lead for his successor unless we can
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk him into staying um just a what
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
we've done when and over the last pick a
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
pick a number 12 years 15 years 20 years
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you think it makees sense we do
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
have that schedule and we can provide it
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
to you I think it would I think it would
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
make a difference and because when you
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
sit down yeah you know cuz I'm guessing
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
that not every politician on the planet
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
has the CTE schedule as like first and
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
foremost in the back of their head yeah
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's mych it lists out the schools the
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
year of the renovation the dollar amount
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
that was spent back during that time
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
frame and we can provide send that out
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
that'll be great otherwise we have to
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
cler Tammy you mentioned that these um
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
all need local level approvals and you
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
said one was presented but had failed
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering which one that
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
would be the Milford one oh Milford okay
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
and then they would go back to at the
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
Town level like like next march is that
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
do all these fall in our March Town time
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:57:46.319 --> 00:57:49.270 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much thank you
thank

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
you like to call up now the community
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
college system of New
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
good morning good
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
morning good morning and thank you for
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
your time U out of consideration uh for
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
the U other presentations that will
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
follow I propose not to walk through a
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
dozen slides but to just summarize what
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
I can and then answer questions that you
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
might have thank
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh community college system
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire seven colleges 11
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
physical locations around the state
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
serving about 23,000 students programs
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
from Advanced manufacturing to welding
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
nothing with a z yet but thinking about
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
it more than 100 programs in between
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
heavy concentration in healthc care
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
including a programs set programs that
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
prepared 320 nurses for New Hampshire
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
this year two key themes that describe
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
our work affordability through
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
partnership with the state to keep
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
tuition low and
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
accessibility helping students both
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
young and working adults to have access
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
to programs that allow them to uh
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
support themselves and their families
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
contribute to New Hampshire's uh
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
future growing portion of our work is
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
occurring online but for any number of
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
our programs again manufacturing related
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
Automotive Health Care clinical students
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
need hands-on experience and so the
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
physical plant that we have across the
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
St the state is incredibly important to
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
our work about 35 buildings about 1.6
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
million square fet uh 2third of those
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
buildings 40 years old in fact more than
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
half of them more than 50 years old and
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
and some showing their their age um as
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see from our request what we're
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
focused on is primarily critical
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh Energy Management there
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
are two areas of focus that I'll come
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
back to but in essence what we're trying
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
to do is continue to be good stewards of
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
the physical plant that we have that
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
serves our state and our
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
community as our work has increasingly
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh seen a growth in the online side some
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
of our buildings are larger than we need
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh but we have been able to repurpose uh
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
nashille is currently working to
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
introduce a Head Start program as we
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
have at Manchester and Littleton uh
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
child care facilities in partnership
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
with uh with others at um one being
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
introduced in Berlin one we already have
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
here in conquered in nhti so want to
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we continue to Steward
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
these resources not only for our own
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
programs but for partners in the state
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
who have use of those facilities in our
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
communities in this by am requesting 7
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
half million heavily concentrated on
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance you'll see on the
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
last slide an outline of what those
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
projects are as well as energy
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
management some of that is actual Energy
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
Management some of that's also ability
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're able to monitor
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
these systems to optimize them to
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate uh imminent failure to
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
maintain them in a way that lessens the
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
likelihood of of critical failures that
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
become more costly to resolve the two
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
targeted requests that we we've made one
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
programmatic a continuation of previous
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
support for Aviation related programs at
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
Nashua an area of growth and opportunity
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
critical for the infrastructure for
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
transportation that also ties to any
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
number of other Industries served by it
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
the other one for information technology
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
not only in support of our growing
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
online and the need to manage that
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
environment address cyber security
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
concerns but also to more fully assess
 
01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
what the future our enterprise system
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
system is we have been on enterprise
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
system supporting our student facing
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
services for almost two decades it
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
happen to be the same system that the
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
university system has been on you may
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
have noted that in the governor's task
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
force this past spring one of the
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we look to move to
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
an enterprise system that would align
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
with University Systems so part of this
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
is to continue the assessment to
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
optimize what we have but assess whether
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility of moving to A A A
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
system okay um yeah couple of of of
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions mainly the first one is your
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance uh do you have a a
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
total amount of deferred maintenance
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
that that you're dealing with that that
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
you have in the back of your head as far
 
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
as what it would take and I know
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner alling house does for the
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
state but I I I'm I'm look looking to a
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
colleague in the past we've used around
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
number of 70 million I'm going to ask
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
the Chief Operating Officer Scott Fields
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
that good
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
morning the number that the chancellor
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
has put out is is correct what we do is
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
on an annualized basis we target to kind
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
of match what our depreciation level is
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis which is roughly 7 a.
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
half million dollar um that we spend to
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
maintain our
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
colleges okay and where does most of
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
that money come from other than
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you get through the capital
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
budget but it was roughly two-thirds of
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
that comes from uh College operations
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
College operations with a third of it
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
coming from the state this has become a
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
focus for our board to elevate the
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
amount of Investments that's being made
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
in oper uh plant maintenance to ensure
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of these buildings okay
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
you you've done um some work with uh um
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
I asked uh um I asked the other
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
Chancellor um a question about housing
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
and and uh old buildings and um first of
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
all let me give you credit for your for
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
your slides um that you have one of my
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
favorite Winston Churchill quotes on the
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
front so I certainly appreciate that um
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
the uh uh do you look at um excess
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
capacity and I I happen to drive by the
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
Tech every day and I and I I feel like
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
something's going on there we we we we
 
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.910 align:start position:0%
something's going on there we we we we
do

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
and housing is a critical need and
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
housing in security is a critical need
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
for many students in community colleges
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
nhti is unique among our colleges in
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
that it has three facilities that have
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
capacity for about 330
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
students post pandemic the demand had
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
fallen off and so for the last year
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
there's been lease arrangement with a
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
private entity that makes use of that
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
for educational purposes compliment to
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
what we do but not not quite the same uh
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
o over time we're continuing to look at
 
01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
all of our physical plant to figure out
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
if it's best highest use as I mentioned
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
earlier the child care centers the Head
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
Start spaces that are available in some
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
cases we've had uh colleagues of state
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
agencies Health and Human Services part
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
of employment supports making use of
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
office space because the clients they
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
serve often have need for programs that
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
we offer so we're looking always for
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
complimentary uses for available space
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um for Partnerships that have synergies
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that may be mutually beneficial not
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
just to the community college system but
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
to other organizations or
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
you so I just had one um more general
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
question which is among these four
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
categories your energy critical
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance Etc um is the funding or the
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
projects scalable within each of those
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
so because it looks like there's um you
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
know under for example under critical
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance might be multiple buildings
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
that are happening so if that instead of
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
7.8 if something was I'm going to make
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
out numbers but 5.8 you know is that
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
scalable in terms of what then you could
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
prioritize within it is every set of
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
projects there's a prioritized list of
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
critical need and so if if it's less but
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
like if it's more we we can also
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
accommodate you would find other things
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
the the the the buildings and and as
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
somebody of the same vintage buildings
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
in their 60s and approaching 70 years
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
still have useful life but some of the
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
update so I noticed in your critical
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance slide um you have a total of
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
66 projects and your ask is $7.8 million
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
and do you think you could accomplish
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
all 66 projects for the 7.8 million
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely the the 66 projects that you
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
see the way that as the chancellor
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have a list of prioritized
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
items a project of the 66 could be just
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
a hand an air handler an hhc unit uh not
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
to the same scale as with the university
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
system presented earlier it's not on
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
that wide scale there being able to
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
maintain individual units as they go
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
across the the different locations
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
you okay great thank you very much
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
you i' like to invite up now please the
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%

Greenway and our finance director at
 
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
peas Development Authority Suzanne
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
anzalone um just for a quick history uh
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
peas had legislature merged division of
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
ports of harbers with the peace
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
Development Authority in 2001 and peace
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
Authority provides administrative
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
oversight for division in ports and
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
harbors uh peas itself is self-funding
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
our Capital Improvement program um we
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
are specifically here for the division
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
of ports and harbors and they have two
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
prioritizing items that director
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
Greenway will will uh happy to answer
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
any questions on the
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
package hi good morning uh miles
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
Greenway so the first one is for Ry
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
Harbor and Hampton Harbor rip W repair
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh sorry apologies no slide deck but
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
what I do have is severe storm impact uh
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
document that we have so basically uh
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
this is to hold what we have for
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
property is the way I look at it as well
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
so if we take a look at
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
page uh 12 and 13 uh pictures tell a
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
thousand words of what we had for Ry
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
Harbor coming through that area in
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
January two different storms within a
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
one week time frame uh what we aren't
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
seeing we do see the white water but uh
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
these are this is a video actually and
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
these are just snapshots of that video
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
with the rip wrap repair what we're
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
hoping to get right there we know the
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
water isn't going to stop coming in but
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
we don't will stop that flow coming
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
in for damages that we had during that
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh our fuel system and our ramp system
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
were damages and that is on page
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
nine and on page six and seven we had
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
from that as
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
well uh and that as a reminder of those
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
of you that if don't know that we did
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
just rece receive a million dollars in
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
arpa funding uh for additional work down
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
well and specifically that Opera funding
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
is for economic development for the
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
retail uh Goods down there Ry Harbor
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
does support uh commercial fishing
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
commercial lobstering um and numerous
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
tourists such as uh wheel watch and
 
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
charter fishing as well as um retail
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
and to add for fuel not just uh in
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth but in Rye and Hampton as
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
well uh fuel's important not just for
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
the commercial fishermen and
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
recreational us users it is uh state law
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement local law enforcement and
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
federal law law enforcement with the co
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
well the second uh project that we have
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
is for the um Market Street marine
 
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.709 align:start position:0%
is for the um Market Street marine
terminal

01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
terminal
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
so this is for dredging in front of the
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
in front of the terminal so um within
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
that package there is a a picture of it
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
but so the federal channel is at
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
maintained by the Army Corps of engineer
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
at 35 ft uh we have 35 ft on the south
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
end of the dock but we're up Shing up to
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
30 and 32 on the Northern side of the
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
dock which is by the song Bridge so the
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
Street terminal is the only deep water
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
port in the state of New Hampshire it uh
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
serves as an ad hoc bulk distribution
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
facility uh primarily all of New
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's roadway salt um comes
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
through the facility it's a critical
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
piece into other uh utility
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure programs throughout the
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
state uh for instance uh utility
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
entities will use it for large scale uh
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
direct shipments from from Europe and
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
and South America uh uh for for any type
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
of power station or antrum wind farm
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
that type of work um that that is goes
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
to Market Street currently we we
 
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.149 align:start position:0%
to Market Street currently we we
advertise

01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
advertise
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
3,500 um meters of depth and we're we're
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're only at 3200 without this dredge
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
so we've recently completed a project um
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
with your help to restore the pair to a
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
good State of Affair it's in great shape
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
now um this dredge would help us uh win
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
some of the business in the region for
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
those ad hoc large scale
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
shipments in addition the vessels right
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
now currently when we get salt ships
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
they lighter in Boston and then when
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
they more they immediately start
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
discharging from the number one and
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
number two holds to what lighter the
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
ship more because of the
 
01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:49.270 align:start position:0%
ship more because of the
Shing

01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's all I have sir okay great uh
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if you could uh
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
tell us about your your Capital needs
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
going forward obviously for building
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
repairs those happen sporadically maybe
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
once every 20 years but but dredging
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
which is a topic I know very little
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
about uh is a continuous thing it would
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
seem and if you could just uh expand
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
upon that like what what what's the need
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
for dredging going forward and on in
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
your different ports number one and
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
number two what other uh significant
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
Capital needs does support does the
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
Development Authority
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh believe they might have going forward
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the next 5 to 10 years or any large
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
ticket items yes sir so for the drudging
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh that we're requesting right now I'd
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
have to we'd have to actually do it the
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
dredging itself and then continue with
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
surveys with the Army Corps or a loc
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
local surveying team that we hire
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
because it's not part of the federal
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
Channel I I know it does say there's a a
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
year in SMA let useful life but I think
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
that might have been left over where we
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
just have to wait and see I mean just
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
recently the Army Corps went up to the
 
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
reach and had to do maintenance dredging
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
as well so there could be a chance that
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the next 2 to 3 years we'd have to
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance dredges again but I we'd
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
have to wait and see with that as well
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
so for the other drudging that we also
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
are uh doing is a 107 feasibility uh as
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
a state rep and that's down in Hampton
 
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
seab Brook and that's moving forward
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
with the Army Corps doing that that's a
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
nav safety uh analysis to see how that's
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to um impact the Waterway uh to
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
include the new 1A Bridge after that as
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you and director Jerry
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
one more priority uh that we do foresee
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the next uh two two to three years uh
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
we do not understand what you're all up
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
against we do not put it into this uh
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
package but uh the Market Street
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
Terminal Warehouse in Portsmouth which
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh was originally designed for liquor
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
distribution before uh the state uh
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
amended the way that it it handles its
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh liquor sales um that warehouse is at
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
end of life um anybody that crosses the
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
the bridge in Dom main we'll probably
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
see The Rusted route uh roof on that on
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
that building um we do are looking to to
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
keep the core office space that supports
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
Division and ports and harbor us uh
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
Customs um and and other entities that
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
that utilize the facility but uh we do
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate about a 3 to 5 million
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
Capital expense down the road uh to
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%

the years we've made much progress
 
01:17:59.629 --> 01:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
tackling deferred maintenance but we
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
still have more to do and we must
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the millions of arpa dollars
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
allocated to this agency we have been
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
able to purchase brand new snowmobile
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
trail groomers develop plans for
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
campsite expansion uh replace very old
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
and outdated bathroom facilities tackle
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
safety and deferred maintenance at some
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
of our beloved historic sites and with
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
the assistance from DPW we continue to
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
plug away at these ARA projects in order
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
to hit our
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
deadlines we have prepared for you a
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
$37.5 million Capital Improvement
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
project request for the next
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
bium and to put this in perspective this
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
is about what uh Jason Tatum makes in a
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
year which I thought was fitting on a
 
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
Day of Victory like today just to get
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
you smiling
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
Charlie go
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
Celtics so I'm going to read off our 11
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
priorities and then we can dig in um to
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
to details so in order uh our number one
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
priority this year is um securing the
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
funding to complete a new Tramway in
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
Frank francon Notch State Park our
 
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
second priority is uh funding to uh
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
design a State Library facility that is
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
offsite um over by our archives
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
building we then have uh facilities in
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
our forest and lands division that need
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
attention number four is Roofing and
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
repairs and which is something that we
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
always um include in our
 
01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
priorities um we have roads and parking
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
lots we have toilet building
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
upgrades uh we have The Lodges at Canon
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
Mountain which need some
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
attention uh historic sites restoration
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
SE Coast planning and resilience
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
similarly to what you just heard from
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
the Port Authority um amog State Park
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%

project um with that I think I will
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
pause I brought with me to the table
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
this morning Brian Wilson who is our
 
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
state parks director and our State
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
library in Michael York um because those
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
are the two projects at the top which
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
are are my
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
bium okay uh question uh on the Tramway
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
there was was it approximately 17
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
million 18 million that was uh
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the legislature in the
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
last budget and now this uh is an
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
additional ask on top of that to meet
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
the $33 million bid correct so we um we
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
went to the legislative um bodies and
 
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
requested 25 million um through a a
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
really lengthy and thoughtful process uh
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
we were happy to accept the 18 million
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
um knowing that we could could fill a
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
gap uh to that 25 with a variety of
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
other potential funding opportunities uh
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
we went out to bid um and uh we received
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
one bid and that was 33 we have sort of
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
stepped you know gone back to our
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
Corners reconsidered how we want to uh
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
approach this um and we have a plan in
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
place uh in coordination with DPW um and
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
some engineering experts to go back out
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
to bid um
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
and and our goal is to separate out the
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
um the Val validated health and security
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
of our existing concrete Towers which
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
should help reduce the overall cost uh
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
that wasn't clear in our first bidding
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
process so we learned that lesson um but
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
in order to go back out to bid we I
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to have the 33 available
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and that's what we're asking for to
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
get us there in in the governor's uh
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
statement he mentioned needs vers things
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
that are nice to have why is the tram a
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
need versus something that's I'll go
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
first and then I'll let Brian jump in um
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely a revenue uh need
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
for our Park system which is
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
operationally self-funded uh generates
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh significant Revenue that we then um
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
spread around the park system or help
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
support the entire park system which is
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh very closely integrated um several
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
years ago the state invested in the
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach SE seashell building for
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
several million dollars it was a big
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
deal uh a big deal for the community and
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
um when we were testifying in you know
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
in in in our initial request for funding
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
for the tram the head of the Hampton
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
Beach Chamber of Commerce came and said
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
you all did this for our region and the
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
state which which dramatically uh
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
boosted our local economy uh I'm here to
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
support you making a similar investment
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
in another part of the state which I
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
thought was um a great perspective um in
 
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
addition to own Revenue having the tram
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
in uh in the notch is a huge draw for
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
tourism and um and we have the support
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
of uh the the local Chambers up there as
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
well for uh making sure that um that
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
this investment that the state has made
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh twice before um is realized so that
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
they uh can continue to benefit from
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
from the activity there and how much
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
revenue does it does it bring in
 
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
annually uh the tram itself um generates
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh about 1.6 to$ 1.8 million annually
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
yeah any guesses on what what the total
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
impact of the tram is I mean because
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
obviously when people come and see the
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
tram they're just spending time uh up in
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
that area and going to restaurants and
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
shops and things like that and doing
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
other things sure well um we we haven't
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
done any uh economic analysis
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
specifically to to the tram but other
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
comparative data uh that like the travel
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
and tourism does for instance um have
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
have shown that for every dollar
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
invested in outdoor recreation generates
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
$25 in tax revenue so uh you think of
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
you know people using the roads or
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
visiting restaurants uh and and those
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
things um I could say that frankon not
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
State Park as our Flagship State Park in
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
in the park system uh is is bringing
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
people from all over the world uh
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
regularly to New Hampshire uh on a yearr
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
round basis um so not unlike Hampton
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
Beach uh the in investment that goes
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
back into the park system not only helps
 
01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh support our operationally selfs
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
supported uh Park system we need the
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to be able to just do the
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
day-to-day stuff and and and welcome
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
people to our locations um but um that
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond just the revenue directly
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh injected into our our operations um
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
and and really supports the community
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
right large in a big way okay and and
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
finally for me um how old is the current
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
tram and this new tram does it have a
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
similar expected life uh the current
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
tram is 44 years old um we on tram
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
version two two uh the first tram uh was
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
40 years old when that was uh um
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
replaced with the current tram in 1980
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
um and we have been given a very hard
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
stop of uh of next summer uh from the
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
current manufacturer of of the current
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
operation so uh it is critical uh both
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
for uh kind of the livelihood of the
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
Canon mountain and frankon Notch but
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
really the the way that the park system
 
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
is is structured that uh if any of our
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure within the park system
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
goes down for instance our largest
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
Campground in the park system right now
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
Greenfield state park is closed for the
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
entire year uh so that we can catch up
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
on deferred maintenance there um that
 
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
has you know a half a million dollar
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
operational impact to us
 
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
um but I can only imagine the economic
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
impact to the greater Greenfield
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
Community um by not having thousands uh
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of of campers coming
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
coming to visit so uh it's it's it's
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a it's it's it's a critical
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
feature within the state park system of
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
the importance of our infrastructure
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay I said it would be the last
 
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
question I I lied to you um one one more
 
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.229 align:start position:0%
question I I lied to you um one one more
the

01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
um when when the system uh is the new
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
system is is built and put in place how
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
long will the will the TR be down for
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance when you do that so you're
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
going to lose a summer basically in my
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
guess we we had um uh on our last
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
iteration of it we were we were planning
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
for about a year and a half so we were
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to lose an entire summer and
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
probably one winter operation for for
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
the construction period I don't see that
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
changing really although we as the
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we've kind of gone
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
back to our Corners to re-evaluate
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
different approaches to this um the
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
complexity of that project would will
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably take uh a good 12 to 18 months
 
01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.790 align:start position:0%
probably take uh a good 12 to 18 months
thank

01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
you um I know we we talk a lot about the
 
01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
park system being self-supporting and um
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
which is which is uh different from a
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
lot of places around the country um it's
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
not the case that every Park is
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
self-supporting it's naturally the case
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
that some parks make a great deal of
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
money and some parks make you know the
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
way Parks exist right they don't make a
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
great deal of money uh frankonia makes
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
the most money of the system maybe
 
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
Hampton how much um oh boy uh well Park
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think uh frankon Notch is is
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
generating over4 million of Revenue and
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's outside that's not including the
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
Canon the ski operation which is another
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
9 million so combined $13 million in in
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
in Revenue produced through frankon not
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
on on an annual period so that is
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
definitely the number one
 
01:27:57.149 --> 01:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
um really the summer drivers for at
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
frankon Notch are are The Flume which is
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
about a little over $3 million in
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and then the tram is kind of
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
the second largest attraction during the
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
summertime with the $1.8 million in
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue so some level the investment
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
you're asking for is not an investment
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
just in one giant metal box but in the
 
01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.350 align:start position:0%
just in one giant metal box but in the
park

01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
park
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
system yes yes and I I would argue that
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
that same logic should be applied to
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
generally everything that we're asking
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
for you know whe whether it's roads or
 
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh updated Utility Systems we can't
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
operate campgrounds if we don't have a
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
safe way to get people in and out of in
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
and out of a campground or if we don't
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
have if we're not able to keep the
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
lights on because our uh utility
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is 60 years old um and
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
we've got to close places down because
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
of that then uh yes the infrastructure
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
investment is critical no I I get that I
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
was looking in in in a colleague's
 
01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
office today and amazed at the complete
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
lack of outlets that she has and it's Cu
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh because it's 85 years old in that
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
particular case um I don't want to not
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
talk about the State library because
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's one of my favorite things and um
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I want to chastise if I can the
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner for letting Michael York
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
retire that doesn't seem appropriate is
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
there was there no way you could stop
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
that from
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
happening I'm
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
old I uh
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
we're all old we we have been so lucky
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
to have um Michael as the head of our
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
State library for a number of years um
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
and he has really been pushing for the
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
future of the State Library um and um
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know the the the research we've done
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
we you know we we've contracted with a
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
firm to give us a really good blueprint
 
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
to move forward um but if if Michael
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
hadn't been
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
um banging on the the the gavel for
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
years um we might not be where we are
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
today which is at a perfect point to um
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
to save our Collections and to um free
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
up some space in the the beautiful State
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
Library building so that we can really
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
engage with the public as we we want to
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
to fulfill our mission I I will say that
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
um the last time we transitioned from
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
one Governor to another um I had the uh
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
fortune or Misfortune depending on your
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
perspective to help out um the guy
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
coming in and my friend Jamie brunett
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I um who was doing something with
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
the transition to had had his meeting
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
with the acting Commissioner of cultural
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
resources at the time uh next to an
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
office that has had a leak in it that I
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
think still has a leak in it probably
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
we'll ask Karen about that later but um
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and it was our favorite meeting of the
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
entire transition I will say that uh not
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
just because there was a raging
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
snowstorm but um uh you're losing a very
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
good valuable state employee but um this
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
particular project um but we wish you
 
01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
well in your retirement it's a good
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
thing um this particular project
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
um storage uh building near the archives
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
can you talk a little bit about the and
 
01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's the history between the
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
library and the archives and the but I
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
think we all get along better than than
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we did 50 years ago um can you
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about that and and
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
sort of the the the way in which this
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
will not just preserve the um the
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
documents and the and the and the rare
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
volumes Etc but will also enhance the
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
the building itself um for future
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
uses well again I think the most
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
important thing is to protect the
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
valuable materials that we have in the
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
State Library uh we are the oldest
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
institution of our type in the country
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
nobody else comes close and this was
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
validated as a question on Jeopardy in
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
2017 by the way um so we have been
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
collecting since
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
1717 and we have a number of incredibly
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
valuable things and the building is just
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
not capable of
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
providing um climate control and the
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
security that we think is necessary the
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
process that we've
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
um chosen to to use is to Simply move
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
those valuable materials to a purpose
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
built facility which will be climate
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
controlled which will be secure because
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's very little that we can do with
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
the existing building I think it's
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
important to remember
 
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
that uh the building at 20 Park Street
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
was built um in in uh 1896 to house both
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
the uh uh Supreme Court and the State
 
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
library and then when we ran out of
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
space or uh were tight for space in the
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
mid-30s they put
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
in um mezzanines which were very
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
functional but horrible they destroyed
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
the character of the building if you
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
look in our lobby we have the ASB built
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
sketches uh from 1896 and you can see
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
that it's just a spectacular building
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
with the Rotunda for the the Rotunda
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
room for the Supreme Court but then also
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
just a beautiful reading room which
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
looks very much like the reading room at
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
the Boston Public Library so um this I
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
think will give us the opportunity first
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
of all to protect the materials that we
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
need to do we have a very
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
small uh room that we constructed about
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
15 years ago to take our some of our
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
valuable materials but not anywhere near
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
what we need to protect um but in in in
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
a in addition to that we will free up
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
space um as the commissioner has said on
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
more than one occasion to make this a
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
more public facing building it people
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
always remark on how beautiful the
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
building is it's built with New
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Granite uh Bethlehem
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
Steel and uh Mosaic uh floors done by
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
Italian Craftsman so there's a real
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have this as a a
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
centerpiece not to take anything from
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
the state house we don't don't want to
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
upstage the state house but it's a
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
beautiful building that we really should
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
show off and more importantly to me as a
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
librarian we need to do a better job of
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
protecting our materials so um it's it's
 
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
time to do this we think that this is a
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
good plan it's not that much money it's
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
only a third of what tum makes right
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
so so I think this this is the time and
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
I greatly appreciate your kind words

cats so I've been talking to him for a
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
long time it's a very good thing I'm a
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
little disappointed that you're not

in your pocket oh there we go that's
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
very good I didn't get a chance to put

thank you for your service thank you
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%

words thank you very much appreciate
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
all and up next Department of
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.669 --> 01:36:20.679 align:start position:0%
good morning hi um I'm sorry the
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner had to leave I um
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'm Charlie Arling housee I'm
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of administrative
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
services and you are I'm Karen rcky the
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
director of plant property
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
um so Karen is an engineer and in charge
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
of buildings so all the tough questions
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
will go to her um I'm here mostly for
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
fluff um I want to I want to talk about
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go through specifically
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
every request we have in our budget the
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
administrative Services part of the
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget is usually usually
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
lengthy and not terribly exciting and
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
which is a a description of our
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
department on some level um we do all
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
the things that aren't terribly exciting
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
but are critically important we manage
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
something like 91 state buildings um
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
there's probably 4 million square feet
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
of office space in the city of conquered
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
alone that we take care of um we have
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance um that's not
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
accurate and we have so much deferred
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance that that we don't keep an
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
accurate number but a good ball Park
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
estimate of how much deferred
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance is probably about a billion
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
dollars um I could I could probably get
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
to a billion and a half if you wanted me
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
to um and obviously we're not going to
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
do that kind of we're not going to do
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff so we're not going to
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
um um keep that accurate a list um um
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
basically what we do is we take care of
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
state buildings we take care of a lot of
 
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
state buildings and we take care of them
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
as best we can there are every
 
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance and utility discussion
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
you've had here today so far applies to
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
us as well um I want to talk about how
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
how we come up with the numbers that we
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
present to you um how do how do we
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
Whittle down the things that need to
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
happen the things that want to happen
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
let me talk separately about the
 
01:38:08.239 --> 01:38:09.390 align:start position:0%
let me talk separately about the
judicial

01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
branch and the rest of us so to speak
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
executive and legislative branch because
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
we we do also take care of the State
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
House and the
 
01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
L I don't know if I want to bring up the
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
L cuz we're meeting here cuz the HVAC
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
system is down so so read into that what
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
you will that's either really good
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
timing or really bad timing
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
um we look at uh so the judicial branch
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
though there are cour houses all over
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
the state we lease space and we and we
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
own space we build courthouses and we
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
lease cour houses that process is done a
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
little bit differently there's a court
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
accreditation committee that talks about
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
standards there's a committee with um
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
actually all of the all of the operating
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of the the Chief Justice and and
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
the ad administrative judge of the the
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
circuit court and Superior Court and and
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
we go through all of the projects one by
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
one by one the state tends to build a
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
courthouse every capital budget maybe
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
not every single capital budget um six
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
years ago we built three I want to say
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
we did Hampton Milford and March County
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the same year does that sound right
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
oh good she's nodding
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
um uh we're currently in the process of
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
building a new courthouse in Rochester
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see cour houses on this list
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
and and what happens is the the court
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
system will prioritize based on how good
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
or bad they are you'll see um discussion
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
about Sullivan County the state has
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
needs in Sullivan County like like uh
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the the state represented
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
cler will know that those are not
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily the premier cour houses in
 
01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
the system although they're in lovely
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
spots on a Newport is quite nice Don
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
clont is quite nice but they need work
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
those priorities are set through the
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
court of process that includes
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
legislative input uh public members
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
appointed by um by the governor um I
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
tend to be lawyers and and in one case a
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
construction executive um the executive
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
branch needs we go through Caren staff
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
basically um walks all of the buildings
 
01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh once every couple of years a process
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
that happened probably a good six months
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
ago and looks at the needs and we
 
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
identify the most pressing needs when I
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
when I started as commissioner which is
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
about 7 years ago I had a meeting one
 
01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
day with uh Karen's predecessor Steve
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
laurenson actually um and I think Karen
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
was in the meeting too as Deputy at the
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
time and um he started talking to me
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
about leaks leaky roofs and this I've
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
talked about this before um a 12 bucket
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
leak and a six bucket leak and and you
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
know I I I figure this is like a
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
technical engineering term right that
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
you know a bucket or it's like a jewel
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
or a watt or you know pick something and
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
I said can you explain what that means
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
and he said sure like in Dairy um when
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
it rains there are six spots that we put
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
buckets to catch the
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
drips that's a six bucket leak if
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's nine it's a nine bucket leak and
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
I went oh okay I kind of get that uh we
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
tend to ask for money to fix the 12
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
bucket leaks and there's not usually
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
enough money to fix the six we we have a
 
01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
lot on here along those lines we also
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
like to pursue projects we're in the
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
process of trying to renew as best we
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
can State space the State House Annex
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
for example is 85 years
 
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
old um the fact that so little work had
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
been done to it except the third floor
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
there was a fire 50 years ago we did
 
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
some work when after the fire but um
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of of doing phase
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
one of the renovations so if you go over
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
there if you go to the GNC breakfast um
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
in a week um in the middle of a
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
construction zone it should be um
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
instructive um but we're doing that uh
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
the money for phase two of that project
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
is is is here and Karen's going to talk
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit about that she's not going
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
to going go through every project but
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
what I want you to know is is is that
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
this is not the work that needs to be
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
done this is a subset of the work that
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be done because we you can't
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
afford to do all the work that needs to
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
be done I think the general fund total
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the of our department request is like
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
190 oh 150 I saved you money already um
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars and and if you said I
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
got 400 I there's no no way I couldn't
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
spend that money and that there's just
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
and and it wouldn't be like did you
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
really need to do that it would be it
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
would be we do leaky roofs we do we do
 
01:42:33.589 --> 01:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
fire panels to bring um um uh buildings
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
up to code and we try to renew if you go
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
through some of the older buildings in
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
the state system one of the things
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
you'll find as you walk
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
around um you'll look walk through them
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
and say good Lord and the number of
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
times you say good Lord is is akin to
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
the number of buckets um but it's it's
 
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing where can we just do
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
this and so what we're our current plan
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
going forward is to try to do as
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
somebody moves out of space recently the
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
van McLoud building um people moved out
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
of that space and other people moved in
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
it was dncr people who moved out and it
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
was dasas people who happen to move in
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
we took U maintenance money and we did
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
we did mold remediation we did uh basic
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
painting Patchwork on walls a little bit
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
of car carpeting moving to carpet
 
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
squares as everybody's doing um because
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
of the long-term maintenance savings
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
that come from that and it was modest
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
makes an enormous difference um and
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do that everywhere and
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of that in the
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
budget too but I'm going to let Karen
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
talk to some of those points
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
now thank you I'm going to cover a
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
couple things that that Charlie didn't
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
mention so one of the things that I um
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
kind of keep track of is you know the
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
industry standard for investing in your
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
buildings is 2% of your building value
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
every year right so over um the course
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
of 50 years you're kind of you know paid
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
for your building prce um our portfolio
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
our 91 buildings I look this up value
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
probably between 750 million and a
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
billion dollars total um so that means
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
that we should be investing at least 15
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
million or 20 million a year or 30 to 40
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
million per banum so just to give a
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
ballpark and I know um you know as Char
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned our requests are about 150
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
million and those are the things that we
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
think we need to do in the next two to
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
three years and then there's other
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
projects that stack up after that um in
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
addition to you Charlie kind of went
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
through commissioner alling house went
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
through the process um that the court uh
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch goes through to
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
prioritize their needs we're at Central
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
facilities which is the rest of our
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
buildings we're going through a um
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
facility condition assessment this
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
coming year um so we were able to fund
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
that through our maintenance funds as
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
well and that will give us a really
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
detailed idea of where our deferred
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance is how many years we have
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
have left on different pieces of
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
equipment different um pieces of our
 
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so we're looking forward
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
to getting the results of that and
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to help inform our next
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
round of capital
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
projects um so as Charlie mentioned um
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
we do have a way that we kind of
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
prioritize our projects um there's an
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
emergency fund that's managed through my
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
office where we have historically have
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
received you know around $1.5 million um
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's available for any state agency to
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
tap into should they have an emergency
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
situ situation that was not planned for
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that we funded in
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
the past um are failed HVAC systems or
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
boilers as you know we can't get through
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
it winter if you don't have heat so
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
that's that becomes an emergency and
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
that needs to get fixed ASAP um water
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
damage that happens we we have water
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
damage either from the roof leaks that
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house mentioned or
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes if we have an piece of HVAC
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
equipment fail the water in that system
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
or the chemicals in that system leak out
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
and they cause damage to the building so
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
various things like that become
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
emergencies if the building becomes
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
uninhabitable we need to get that fixed
 
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
right away and make sure that state
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
agencies can continue their
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
operations um kind of next down after
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
that is our life Safety project so fire
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
panels came up um fire panels elevators
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
things that we absolutely need to
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
operate a building become life safety
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
issues boilers become Life Safety here
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because of the
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
temperatures that we're dealing with um
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
next after that is building preservation
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to let our buildings
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
get so bad that then they cost even more
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
to repair so things like roofs um brick
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
repointing uh over time that becomes
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
something that you can't fix and then it
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
has to be reconstructed new construction
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
renovation kind of comes after that and
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
then we have Energy savings and
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
automation so things that make our
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
buildings more efficient whether it be
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
through Energy savings or just labor
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
savings because of
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
automation um so so that's kind of my
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
overview I I do have all of the
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
information on the projects in front of
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
me today and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions the two handouts that came
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
around one is regarding the phase 2
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
renovation of the State House Annex so
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're starting that phase one renovation
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
now there's a couple images here that
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
just show what the building is going to
 
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
look like once it's 100% complete um the
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
office space is going to be much much
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
nicer and much more efficient um the
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
layout is kind of the second picture
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
that you have there which kind of shows
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
a combination of open office area space
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
with some offices sprinkled in there so
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
that um supervisors can be in the same
 
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
area their staff um but the space is
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
used much more efficiently and then the
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
final picture is an old picture of what
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
the annex used to look like from the
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
outside which shows what we really want
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
to restore the windows to look like
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
because the windows on honestly right
 
01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
now are kind of hideous so um so that's
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that first handout you have the second
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
handout alludes to the Sullivan County
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh request that commissioner Arling
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
house also mentioned and it has two
 
01:47:47.790 --> 01:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
pages of photos from each of the cour
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
houses so Claremont Circuit Court
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
Sullivan um I'm sorry Newport yeah
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and um and and Newport
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh Circuit Court um my superintendent of
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
Court facilities took some pictures just
 
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
to show the deficiencies in those
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
current locations um to kind of indicate
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know why we're making this request
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
to consolidate those three cour houses
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
into one new
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
facility the thing I forgot to mention
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
is the the on the prioritize list the
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
number one request is an IT request
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
which is related to the the state's
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
enterprise system um historically uh
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
Enterprise systems of that nature of the
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide nature the enterprise system
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
being the the computer system that runs
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
well all of state government it does
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
payroll HR finances budgeting
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
purchasing well everything um there are
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
routine and regular upgrades that that
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
need to be done to it and and the state
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
adopted a posture about 10 years ago um
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
people will know this um if you're um
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
old like me um that the state for a long
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
time one of the ways the state decided
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
to save money was by not uh keeping up
 
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
on on its computer system so that um you
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
save a little bit of money each year and
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
then you have a catastrophic failure in
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think it was 2006 78 in that range and
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
you have to spend God awful amounts of
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
money because everyone who knew how to
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the system has either died or
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
retired let's assume they all retired um
 
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
and and you don't want that so this is a
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
modest request it's about $5 million but
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
it would going forward we would we would
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
not just uh we're we're going through an
 
01:49:34.589 --> 01:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
upgrade right now A M A significant
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
modernization but we would look at
 
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
subsystems that are not part of it you
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
know treasury might be an example of
 
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
that for example for for I don't know
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
cashbook and other treasury things that
 
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
I don't understand that Sherry will
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
laugh at me if I talk too much about
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
them um but that's that piece as
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
well any questions anybody has
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
whatsoever uh paent okay thank you
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
because I from Claremont in Sullivan
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
County and my question is I think the
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
total request and I'm reading figures a
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
little bit 28 million for the
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
renovations to the Sullivan County
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
courts I mean I'm sorry if I'm reading
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
that wrong 20 or 20 28 I think I read
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
that correctly 656 that's that is right
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
total cost for those courts in Claremont
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
and Newport correct it would be a single
 
01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
building that would be constructed that
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
would incorporate all three of those
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
current which are all leased locations
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
currently okay a single building and a
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
followup how in the priority list is
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
this going to I mean do you have Rec how
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
what's the priority for for Sullivan
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
County whatever work you uh want to do
 
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
so this was the number one request from
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch it falls at number
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
six in the overall Das list so that's
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
after the IT project that commissioner
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
Arling house mentioned in several other
 
01:50:54.589 --> 01:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
kind of Life Safety projects that we
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
have okay just to be clear uh thank you
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
oh you said it's number one in the
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is that correct yeah so
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
the so it's the number one priority of
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
the court system that's what court
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
system wants but in the overall listing
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
it's actually just number it's six but
 
01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.310 align:start position:0%
it's actually just number it's six but
in

01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
our extensive list that's pretty let's
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
just put that in the upper quintile okay
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
all right six out of 34 in a list that
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
goes Way Beyond 34 exactly
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay yeah my my question is you you
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that total uh deferred
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance being somewhere a billion
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
you get up to a billion five but let's
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
let's let's use the billion because it's
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not good at math so we have that we
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
have request for 150 million for the B
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
Anum that $75 million a year that's
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
75% uh of your total lower cost of your
 
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.390 align:start position:0%
75% uh of your total lower cost of your
deferred

01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
deferred
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance is that
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
enough well I mean the the obvious
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
answer is no but it it it has to be and
 
01:52:00.069 --> 01:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
the the the state the state has a has a
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
method and at the end of the day um I
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
used to say to people that they they
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
name new Bridges after people they don't
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
name Bridge repairs after anybody um and
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's true of the Leaky Roof as well
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
right that they they don't name this is
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
the the James Gary Memorial um maybe
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
won't put Memorial in there um roof
 
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
repair um it's it's just a natural thing
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
that that there are going to be big
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
projects we're going to see some right
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the course of a day and a half of
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
hearings we're going to see some really
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
big items and you look at it and you
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
say well I'm going to use I'm going to
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
use uh commissioner steuart as an
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
example right the the the Tramway is a
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
really really really big important thing
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
and and you get that and you get that
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
because of the size of it and the scope
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
of it and the and the impact is so much
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
more dramatic related to it um the ouse
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
repairs are arguably on a Saturday
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
afteron noon in in in June equally
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
important especially to somebody and um
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
but they're they're they don't have the
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
have the same cache we're we have a lot
 
01:53:06.069 --> 01:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
of things like that I mean if if the
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
state had the money we would probably
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to spend upwards of uh a 100
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
million a year over the course of about
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
a dozen years in deferred maintenance so
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
we had a plan the problem is that's all
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
bonded all bonded costs and I I don't I
 
01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
don't see within our financial system
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
how we get there so what we do is we
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
look at we just we try to prioritize as
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
best we can and and and make an effort
 
01:53:33.159 --> 01:53:33.870 align:start position:0%
best we can and and and make an effort
and

01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
so is anything ever enough no it's not
 
01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
and and but it's what we have okay if
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
you were and this is sort of a a guest
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
on your part um what I'm I'm trying to
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
find out is how much are we falling
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
behind meaning in today's dollars what
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
what would our referred maintenance look
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
like 10 years ago uh would it in today's
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
do would it be a billion you know so
 
01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:02.679 align:start position:0%
we're maintaining or would it be would
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
it have been 1.5 billion we actually
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
made some gains or conversely you we we
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
despite all the money we're spending are
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
we still falling behind and and in five
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
years is that number going to be not 1
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
billion but 1.3 billion I I think we are
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
falling further behind and some of that
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
is related to the to the to the age of
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
the building it moved some people out
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing some renovation
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
particularly mechanical
 
01:54:32.069 --> 01:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
renovation um to an 85y old building the
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
annex right that largely constructed in
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
1939 dedicated I think in 1940 but
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so I moved people out of this you
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
know decaying building and we moved
 
01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719 align:start position:0%
three of our divisions um for a brief
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
period of time which is probably years
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
not months um to a building that was
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
built in 1843
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
on the main building on the State
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
Hospital campus where where what did we
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
do we did we did some painting we did
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
some wiring we did some carpet work and
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
and it's significantly improved how
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
improved it's okay and it depends on
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do um and you know
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
the it system is good for this but not
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
good for that uh the mechanical systems
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
are are okay but better in some ways
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
than others so are we falling further
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
behind we are what's what's the number
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
the truth is that that we don't know
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
we've never had to know we've never uh
 
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
we've never had a good number this year
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
um with maintenance fund money Karen
 
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
talked about the facility assessment
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
survey we we're going to for the first
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
time in decades probably um have a more
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh professional facility
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
assessment it it's going to tell us
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
things that we don't want to know um
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
except I would like to know the things I
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to know and so well a better
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
sense of that and you know when are
 
01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:56.199 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems going to fail you
 
01:55:58.030 --> 01:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
know I we had an issue with a mechanical
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
with a air conditioning the other day in
 
01:56:03.149 --> 01:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
a in a building and I thought in my head
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm like this is one of the newest
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
buildings in state government in terms
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
of Renault and this is one of our newer
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems and basically what
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
the tech said is you can't expect a
 
01:56:17.229 --> 01:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
system that's 20 years old not to break
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm like how is it that the system
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
that I have to expect it's going to
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
break in my head is the is one of the
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
least likely to break in the system the
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
problem is both of those things are true
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.430 align:start position:0%
at the same
time

01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:56:38.159 --> 01:56:43.870 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
thank

01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
you and with that that concludes our
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
morning session so we will now be in

resume the capital budget
 
04:02:57.389 --> 04:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
hearings for this afternoon and uh first
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
up is the judicial branch so I'd like to
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
invite you to come up and give your
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon Diane
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
Martin director of the administrative
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
office of the courts and Donna Raymond
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal manager of the judicial
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
branch thank you for having us would you
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
like me to just dive into an overview
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll give you some
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
background on why why we are doing this
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
and how it started um a little bit over
 
04:03:40.110 --> 04:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
a year ago well more than that I went
 
04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
out and started touring some courts when
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
I started in this position and one of my
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
observations in the courts which I know
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
other folks have observed is that we
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of paper documents that are
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
in files that are stored in various
 
04:03:56.149 --> 04:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
places throughout the courts um those
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
are actually taking a lot of space that
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
could be used for other things like
 
04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
staff um you might see court records you
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
know in files along the wall like you'd
 
04:04:10.030 --> 04:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
imagine but you might also see them
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
under desk spaces wherever we have
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
courts that are very small wherever they
 
04:04:17.149 --> 04:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
need to be so um after visiting a few of
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
those courts I was concerned that we
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
might be able to make better use of the
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
space and um make those documents more
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
easily accessible to members of the
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
public coming in to get access to them
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
and so um Julie Lamson our court
 
04:04:35.790 --> 04:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
operations uh project manager went out
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
to every single Court in the state and
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
assessed the stateof court records in
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
those individual courts and came back to
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
the administrative Council and reported
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we really need to do something
 
04:04:50.429 --> 04:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
about the number of paper records in the
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
courts um and she had a number of
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
proposals one of which was to start
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
digitizing the records and we um
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
implemented that about a year ago by
 
04:05:05.550 --> 04:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
using just standard um small desktop
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
scanners and and temporary people um to
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
come in and start doing that work and
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's actually been fairly effective
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
however it is incredibly slow and so we
 
04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
might be doing this um into the next
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
century and so that might not accomplish
 
04:05:23.950 --> 04:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
the goal that we had of freeing up that
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
space and making the records more
 
04:05:28.349 --> 04:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
accessible so the thought was if we
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
could get better equipment and some
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
software we might be able to accomplish
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
those things more quickly so that really
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
is what this is for it's for um highe
 
04:05:41.950 --> 04:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
industrial type scanners and then
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
software that would allow for
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
um digitization and accessibility I'm
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
not a tech person but um to be able to
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
make those searchable and more easily
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
retrievable so that is the
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
concept if you have any questions I'd be
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them yeah once the
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
system is online what sort of
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
Maintenance does it require to keep it
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
are you going to need this always
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
because obviously you have new records
 
04:06:10.750 --> 04:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
coming in every day so most of our
 
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
current records are going into our case
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
management system electronically already
 
04:06:17.309 --> 04:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
so this is really a historical problem
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
that hopefully will not be a forever
 
04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
problem uh it's just something that the
 
04:06:24.030 --> 04:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
courts haven't had the resources to
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
commit time to to make it happen so I
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
think it's onetime expenses are what you
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
have before you to the extent the
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
software requires any maintenance that
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
would be an ongoing expense that is not
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
included here and would being in the
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget okay any estimates on
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
that and what that would be uh I do have
 
04:06:43.229 --> 04:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
it I can send it to you I don't know it
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head very good it's
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's obviously smaller than the the
 
04:06:51.870 --> 04:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
first uh initial onetime cost okay thank
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
you any additional questions Mr
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner speaking of uh historical
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
records we we' talked in the past about
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
um archival storage space in the
 
04:07:04.030 --> 04:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
basement of the Supreme
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
Court um which I think Justice Marone
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
had Champion where is that now um we had
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh in conjunction with your team and the
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
Bure of Court facilities um an engineer
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
did a design and an estimate and my
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is the estimate was
 
04:07:24.429 --> 04:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than was hoped and
 
04:07:26.590 --> 04:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
so I think it was not it was cost
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
prohibitive at least at this point in
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
time like 3x right or something like
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
that it was good yeah so that's so
 
04:07:36.910 --> 04:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
nothing and there's no capital budget
 
04:07:39.790 --> 04:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
request related to that anywhere no the
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
digitization of the the um old books in
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
the library is ongoing we got Capital
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
funds and arpa funds for that so that's
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
occurring I think the Hope was that many
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the artifacts and then the old books
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
would go into that archive um so I
 
04:07:57.149 --> 04:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that Justice Hans Marone
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
has given up hope but the number that we
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
you hi Diane hi I I heard you say
 
04:08:12.910 --> 04:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
accessible and I just want to qualify a
 
04:08:16.030 --> 04:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
lot of folks are creating PDFs nowadays
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and and with the with the new standards
 
04:08:19.950 --> 04:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
are coming out from the feds uh I just
 
04:08:21.309 --> 04:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
want to double check that you're
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about making sure that the
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
documents will be accessible according
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
to federal guidelines so my
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this would make
 
04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
them more readily accessible in the
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
first instance to our court staff so for
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
example right now if you go to a court
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
and you need a document let's say the
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
hearing was in Manchester but the court
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
houses them in nashaa it may require the
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
documents to actually be transferred and
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
so making them accessible to court staff
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and also to make them searchable I'm
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
not sure about the other requirements
 
04:08:55.109 --> 04:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
but I can get back to you on that yeah
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
it what I would suggest that you take a
 
04:08:59.229 --> 04:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
look and in fact we can share with you
 
04:09:01.309 --> 04:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh Kate Kate mner who's been working on
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know collaborating on website stuff
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
with your folks um has all kinds of
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
documentation on that and the way you do
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
PDFs will determine whether um you know
 
04:09:12.429 --> 04:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
it's accessible or not whether it falls
 
04:09:14.189 --> 04:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
into those guidelines and and we're
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
seeing much more public activity holding
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
us accountable to doing it correctly so
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
I'd say doing it up front is going to be
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
a lot easier and less expensive than you
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
know having to redo them when after the
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
fact because somebody calls you out so
 
04:09:30.510 --> 04:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
that was I just wanted to let you know I
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.229 --> 04:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
two um my question is more tangental
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
this morning um Department of Justice
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
was talking about uh procuring a new
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
case management system and you had
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have one and I was
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you have been talking
 
04:09:48.429 --> 04:09:48.439 align:start position:0%
with them at all or what do you use well
 
04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
so our case management system is more
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
designed for um court records versus doj
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
has a very
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
attorney um their approach and
 
04:09:59.469 --> 04:09:59.479 align:start position:0%
requirements are very different so we're
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
certainly always happy to collaborate um
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
but I think it may be a slightly
 
04:10:04.239 --> 04:10:08.830 align:start position:0%
but I think it may be a slightly
different

04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
scope hey see none thank you very much
 
04:10:16.750 --> 04:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'd now like
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
to invite the judicial
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
councel Mr chairman I think the judicial
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
Council withdrew their request um you
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
won't have seen it but this morning oh
 
04:10:34.269 --> 04:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon is my
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that you have withdrawn
 
04:10:37.119 --> 04:10:38.229 align:start position:0%
understanding that you have withdrawn
your

04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
request okay and and the reason for the
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawn request is
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
microphone the microphone turn it on
 
04:10:54.030 --> 04:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
just to button in Fr there we go there
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
we go thank you um we had requested
 
04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
funding uh through U gopher and we
 
04:11:02.349 --> 04:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
received some arpa funds and we had also
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
alongside that issued a request for
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
information to get a sense of what the
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
cost would be and we got the some
 
04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
responses back from the from that
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
request for information um along with
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
the Arun and after looking at those two
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
things it appeared that the ARA funding
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
was going to be enough to meet our needs
 
04:11:20.429 --> 04:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
okay very good any do you have any other
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
Capital needs that you're requesting at
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
this point no okay easy enough yes first
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
time I've said this all hearing your
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
request is
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
granted thank you you're welcome thank
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
much uh next on the list is police
 
04:11:45.309 --> 04:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
you the uh the project that we're
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
seeking to get uh funding for is to help
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
increase the physical security of our
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
building uh
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
specifically uh to uh be able to build
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
some doors uh that will help us close
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
off our lobby uh the building we occupy
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
was built in the 1980s and there was
 
04:12:19.149 --> 04:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
really no consideration given uh for
 
04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
building security back in those
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
days uh you know clearly uh people can
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
walk into the building unimpeded right
 
04:12:29.309 --> 04:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
now it's a it's an open campus much like
 
04:12:32.790 --> 04:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
a college uh to that end uh we are
 
04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
seeking funds to allow us to uh put a
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
door on uh one side of the lobby that
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
would close off the hallway to the
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
training uh port of the building and
 
04:12:48.429 --> 04:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
then a door uh that would close off uh a
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
ladder well that would access the second
 
04:12:53.109 --> 04:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
deck where we have uh the conduct Review
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
Committee and other office space and
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
residential space on top of that we are
 
04:13:00.189 --> 04:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
seeking funding that would help us
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
augment uh a process that would allow us
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
to have an intercom system and some uh
 
04:13:11.109 --> 04:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
ACC Access Control to those doors so
 
04:13:12.910 --> 04:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
that we could have a staff member Buzz
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
needed okay
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the the staff member that would
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
be buzzing people in and out is that a
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
new position because you don't obiously
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
there there are no buzzing and no one
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that task now so are you
 
04:13:34.269 --> 04:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
looking for a new position for that as
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
well someone who maintains the Integrity
 
04:13:39.790 --> 04:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
of the security or so we we presently do
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
have somebody who works at at the window
 
04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
for lack of better term uh are uh we
 
04:13:47.950 --> 04:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
operate now on the premise that people
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
are going to be compliant and will uh
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
actually walk up to the window that's
 
04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
very deep into the lobby where the staff
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
member would uh you know address
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
whatever concerns or questions they have
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
so we don't need uh an extra person uh
 
04:14:05.149 --> 04:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
we just need to kind of uh build this um
 
04:14:06.910 --> 04:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
these safety structures in a way that we
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
can control that Lobby a little bit
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
better than we can now okay how many
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
points of access are there into the
 
04:14:12.560 --> 04:14:13.550 align:start position:0%
points of access are there into the
facility

04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:14:15.870 --> 04:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
is it just the two or there are there
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
more that you're not concerned with uh
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire facility yeah so
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are a significant number of
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
access points uh that will allow people
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
to enter the building from all portions
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
of that building uh we were able uh to
 
04:14:34.990 --> 04:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
um get permission to realign our
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
existing uh budget we're just getting
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
rid of to close it out now to help us uh
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
address a significant number of safety
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that we we have to include uh
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
door access and alarming and uh video
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
camera so we we were able to kind of
 
04:14:52.750 --> 04:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
start moving in that direction uh with
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
all of those other doorways hallways a
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
lot of common space that we need to to
 
04:15:01.229 --> 04:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
be able to monitor um this is really
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
just for that main lobby uh which is
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
really the the most wide openen portion
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
of the building okay thank you any other
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
04:15:20.349 --> 04:15:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
folks next up we have the Department of
 
04:15:25.469 --> 04:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
Services invite you to come up and give
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.710 --> 04:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon
 
04:15:56.590 --> 04:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner good
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
request thank you for having us um I
 
04:16:07.710 --> 04:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
have Dave weers with me uh who's our
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
chief operating officer who will walk
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
through um most of the items here today
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh as you can imagine we actually have
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of capital item requests um
 
04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to just point out this is
 
04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
probably one of the only years that I've
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
been involved that we've narrowed it
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
down to eight we usually submit like 15
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
to 20 some ODS so uh just trying to be
 
04:16:31.109 --> 04:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
mindful as well um and I'm not sure on
 
04:16:33.870 --> 04:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
the version that you have um if you have
 
04:16:35.429 --> 04:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
the kitchen New Hampshire hospital
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
Kitchen on that yeah so I just wanted to
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
point out that we have withdrawn that
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
item um we're looking for alternative
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
funding for that so that would put these
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
seven items in front of you today that
 
04:16:51.630 --> 04:16:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
through thank you and thank you for um
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
having me today my my name is David
 
04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
weeders I'm the chief operating officer
 
04:16:58.880 --> 04:16:59.630 align:start position:0%
weeders I'm the chief operating officer
for

04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
thhs and hopefully in your slide deck on
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the second um slide you'll see eight
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
Capital project requests in nine
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
including the kitchen that would be
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
stricken or
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawn so the first project um
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
medicated Enterprise modular strategy
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to roll into that into the
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
third slide here and give you some
 
04:17:24.670 --> 04:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
background so over the last four or five
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
years we've been building a Medicaid
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
enterprise system strategy and we we
 
04:17:31.229 --> 04:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
leverag Capital funds for the last
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
couple years to implement um and
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
actually move forward on provider
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
Management Systems integrator um data
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
warehouse Pharmacy benefits management
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
and electronic visit verifications
 
04:17:45.790 --> 04:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
modules and then we're we're seeking
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
additional funds to continue that effort
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
it is a five-year total project or
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
program that in order to replace that
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
system we have up up to about 14 modules
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
that we're working towards and this next
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
Capital um request is to continue that
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
effort and move forward for implementing
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
the third party liability which is
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
really maximizing cost of ordance or
 
04:18:12.990 --> 04:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
addressing fraud in the Medicaid Program
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
in ensuring that if people have a
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance or other insurance
 
04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid is the last the last pay
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
payer for for those
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
claims and then the next one is Care
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
Management or member management it's
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
really looking to integrate our data
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
sources and manage our members um very
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
similar to the new height system or
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility but really
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
building upon that and doing Care
 
04:18:40.269 --> 04:18:40.279 align:start position:0%
Management across all the Continuum of
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
Care through services at Health and
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
Human Service
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then the last module that's
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this um Capital request
 
04:18:50.189 --> 04:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
is a call center management so one of
 
04:18:51.870 --> 04:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
the key components that we're trying to
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
address is when you go to seek services
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
and you can see this across the state
 
04:18:58.590 --> 04:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
but if you go to seek services in DHHS
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different phone
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that you can call if you don't
 
04:19:04.510 --> 04:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
know which number to call you Call 1800
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
s DHHS and then they help you get to
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
another call center and many people
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily enjoy going from one
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
call center inter next and going through
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
call cues our goal is to consolidate
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
that and look at a department approach
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
in a whole person or a citizen 360
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
approach for call center management the
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
total cost for this one would be
 
04:19:29.710 --> 04:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
33,700 th000 of which we would be
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
seeking um Federal funding in the 90%
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
match and so the general fund impact
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
$3,375 th000 which you should see in
 
04:19:40.030 --> 04:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
today um the key there is we and we are
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
very optimistic this is following um
 
04:19:46.830 --> 04:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
center for Medicare and Medicaid
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
services plans for replacement so we
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
would be fairly confident of getting
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
that Federal match
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
dollars the next one if there wasn't any
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions on the Medicaid enterprise
 
04:20:03.630 --> 04:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
system I don't know if you want me to
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
stop um thanks David so you said this
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
would be about a 5year implementation
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
have you because it sounded like you
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
started some of this already so are you
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
already somewhere in your 5-year period
 
04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
we are um thank you for the question um
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
Sherry uh we are basically two years
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
into the 5-year program so this last two
 
04:20:23.790 --> 04:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
years we've been doing the system
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
integrator and laying the foundation for
 
04:20:26.279 --> 04:20:27.070 align:start position:0%
integrator and laying the foundation for
this

04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
implementation um it's taken some time
 
04:20:30.990 --> 04:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
to go through rfps and get through
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
through that so the system integrator
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
was actually published about three weeks
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
ago and then we implemented electronic
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
visit verification module um back in May
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
or April and May and then we also are on
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
track with the current capital funding
 
04:20:49.389 --> 04:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
for the pharmacy benefits management
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
solution and the um the provider
 
04:20:54.189 --> 04:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
management and the data warehousing so
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
those are all funded with existing
 
04:20:58.950 --> 04:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
Capital this Capital request continues
 
04:21:01.389 --> 04:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
that and for the next two years of that
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
b of the next bium and then we'll have a
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
a subsequent potentially a subsequent
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
Capital requests for the following bium
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
to implement the claims module what
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
What's the total cost you mentioned
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
you've already been working on this
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
what's the cost spent to date you have
 
04:21:21.109 --> 04:21:21.119 align:start position:0%
the 3 uh 3.75 million here and then you
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned an additional cost all in
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
what's What's the total price tag on
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
this so uh I can give you what we
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
currently have and I'll try to add it in
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
my head but the current capital projects
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
that are in place there's a $90 million
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
on Capital project for for the mmis or
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
the medic management information system
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
reprocurement and then another six
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
6,700 ,000 I believe 750,000 for the
 
04:21:50.149 --> 04:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
data the data warehouse so that's 96 750
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
plus the 33 and I'm not okay I I'll add
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
it up but and and they're all and the
 
04:22:00.389 --> 04:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
at yeah and just um yeah the future one
 
04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:05.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have it planned out because we
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
would have to go out and do a lot of the
 
04:22:09.309 --> 04:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
analysis but we I would imagine the
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
claims engine is going to be anywhere
 
04:22:14.590 --> 04:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
from 60 to $100 million to do and we're
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
looking at alternatives to see if we can
 
04:22:18.910 --> 04:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
avoid that cost in the future and
 
04:22:21.030 --> 04:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
utilize some of the existing system and
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
move forward with that but that will
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
depend on procurement requirements um
 
04:22:28.630 --> 04:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
Fair Mark Fair um Fair
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
um Fair access to other vendors as well
 
04:22:34.510 --> 04:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
as our federal partners and as a
 
04:22:36.269 --> 04:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
clarification those funds that I was
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
giving or total costs those are the the
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
100% all all in 90% of that is federal
 
04:22:42.159 --> 04:22:43.229 align:start position:0%
100% all all in 90% of that is federal
dollars

04:22:43.229 --> 04:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:22:45.750 --> 04:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
and 10% of it is general fund so that
 
04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
will be the so if you're looking at 96
 
04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
plus 33 about 125 million or so 12 a.
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
half million is the general fund
 
04:22:57.630 --> 04:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
impact thank you David oh sry you had
 
04:23:00.149 --> 04:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
said that you were um fairly confident
 
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
with the federal reimbursement does that
 
04:23:04.349 --> 04:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
happen at the very end of the project do
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
they do approvals along the way at the
 
04:23:09.630 --> 04:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
90% they do approvals along the way so
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
it's basically we we file the doents in
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
in advance we filed our plan our our
 
04:23:17.950 --> 04:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
total plan of what we're doing including
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
the claims module they won't actually
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
approve the dollars until we go and say
 
04:23:24.109 --> 04:23:24.119 align:start position:0%
this is how much we believe we need for
 
04:23:26.590 --> 04:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
provider management so what happens is
 
04:23:30.269 --> 04:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
by the time we go to RFP we've already
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
have approval to be able to submit the
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
RFP based off of the not to exceed
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
amounts if if you're looking at the um
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
for those of those of us who aren't
 
04:23:44.189 --> 04:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
computer is um I I'm trying to
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
understand how this fits into the whole
 
04:23:48.830 --> 04:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
scheme of government and your operation
 
04:23:50.590 --> 04:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
and all that so this is about you're
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to spend about 200 million when
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
you're done is on fair enough it is this
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
all part of quote unquote
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
mmis or and now does that just
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
administer Medicaid um basing that on
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
its name or how does that fit into your
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
operation broadly what does it control
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
service do
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question commissioner
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
um it's it's both so the Medicaid
 
04:24:21.870 --> 04:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
enterprise system the way many states
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
and our our states know different is
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
leveraging it is leveraging the Medicaid
 
04:24:27.910 --> 04:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
funds to replace that Medicaid
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
management system with infrastructure to
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
that could be used elsewhere so we're
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
partnering with um Department of
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
Information Technology to build some of
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
those foundations so the system
 
04:24:42.510 --> 04:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
integrator RFP will will initially be
 
04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
focused because that's how we get our
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
funding on Medicaid recipients and
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries but then it can scale out
 
04:24:51.950 --> 04:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to integrate systems for
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
across DHHS as well as um if the
 
04:24:58.349 --> 04:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule needs to be a
 
04:25:00.510 --> 04:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
multi-tenant and use across the the
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
state um so we're still in those
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
discussions on how that rolls out but it
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
is a flexible frame framework so that we
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
could it's sort of like the phone
 
04:25:12.269 --> 04:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
company I look at is the system manag
 
04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
inators like the phone companies where I
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
can have a Verizon phone you can have a
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
T-Mobile phone but we all can call each
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
other um the system integrator allows
 
04:25:21.790 --> 04:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
for those standards to occur so that you
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
can call me and not have to switch from
 
04:25:26.830 --> 04:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
a T-Mobile phone to a Verizon phone to
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
call me um I don't know if that's a good
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
analogy but that's that's works for me
 
04:25:36.269 --> 04:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
EAS um the uh my phone is one of the few
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
devices I'm capable of using although
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
you can you'll be able to leverage this
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
internally for other um client or
 
04:25:53.389 --> 04:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
customer based things that you do
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
outside of the eventually outside of the
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
Medicade space is that what is that what
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
you're saying you're sort of the
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
architecture will work for you can bolt
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
on something to and you can use it for
 
04:26:08.910 --> 04:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
other client sets so to speak correct so
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
and not all of the moduls can you do
 
04:26:12.030 --> 04:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
that with but the system integrator you
 
04:26:12.040 --> 04:26:13.030 align:start position:0%
that with but the system integrator you
can

04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh Pharmacy benefits management we used
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
to have two contracts one for public
 
04:26:18.870 --> 04:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
health and one for Medicaid they were
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
doing very similar functions so we
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
combine them and they're in one RFP in
 
04:26:24.149 --> 04:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
the future and there'll be one solution
 
04:26:26.950 --> 04:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
one Pharm Pharmacy benefits management
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
system the data warehouse is another one
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
that we're leveraging as more of a
 
04:26:33.309 --> 04:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
platform as opposed to a Medicaid
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
specific it's certainly initially funded
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
primarily by Medicaid so that we can get
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
it the onetime cost built out and then
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
SC scale it so we have to do cost
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
allocations and make sure that we are
 
04:26:47.910 --> 04:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
upfront with our federal partners that
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to scale it and that if um
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
children youth and families decides to
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
use that warehouse they need to come up
 
04:26:56.429 --> 04:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
with funds from Administration for
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
children and families and general funds
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
to do their expansion but it's Le much
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
less expensive to expand on an existing
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
platform and like if you take an analogy
 
04:27:10.750 --> 04:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
of a building you can build a building
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
and then you can add different you can
 
04:27:13.950 --> 04:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
split the rooms up with additional
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
internal walls cheaper than building
 
04:27:18.510 --> 04:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
multiple buildings can I say you're
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
building a road and you can drive other
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
cars on
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
it that that's that's certainly how
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
system integrator would be yes okay
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
sorry good afternoon afterno I just
 
04:27:36.429 --> 04:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment that um you know not
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
only is there potential reuse for some
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the stuff inside DHHS but also the
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
way we've been approaching together
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
which I do appreciate the collaboration
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
um other agencies in some cases can
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
leverage as well so we have examples uh
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
already where things that were you know
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
were invested in at
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
DHHS um you know maybe initially were
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
designed in a way that other agencies
 
04:28:02.349 --> 04:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
could could use them and we're doing
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
that in a number of spaces the U
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
electronic business intelligence the
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
Salesforce standard standardizing on
 
04:28:11.710 --> 04:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
that platform so uh the state as a whole
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
is benefiting from that approach not
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:21.550 --> 04:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
so sorry I just had one other is this
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a uh cloud-based system or
 
04:28:27.790 --> 04:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
will it be on-prem in the future
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
currently um the majority of these
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions are planned to be cloud-based
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
there might be some hybrid Solutions
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
depending on the needs and so that it
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
comes down to requirements so like the
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
data warehouse will certainly be a
 
04:28:41.469 --> 04:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
hybrid solution at first but there might
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
be a transition to the cloud entirely
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
whereas the system integrator is planned
 
04:28:48.870 --> 04:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be in the cloud entirely I was just
 
04:28:50.269 --> 04:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's additional sort of
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
operating costs that you'll start to
 
04:28:54.750 --> 04:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
incur that you don't have today or
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
savings from costs you have today that
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
you won't need in the future yeah
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
certainly so the operating cost on this
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
particular Capital request is about $15
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
million and that's for the Professional
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
Services to support the solution help
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
desk type support maintaining the cloud
 
04:29:12.189 --> 04:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and being able to support
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
um additional enhancements at a very
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
like not major uplifts but upgrading
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining um the hardware maintaining
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
the software versions so that we don't
 
04:29:25.469 --> 04:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
have to worry about that internally
 
04:29:27.630 --> 04:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
where in in the past in many
 
04:29:29.950 --> 04:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
organizations you don't fund the the
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of it and then you have
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
systems that fail this that $15 million
 
04:29:39.630 --> 04:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
which um our plan is to go through um
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
certification processes which we then
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
can be eligible to get 75% Federal match
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid component and a smaller
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
match for the other divisions components
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
so it won't be an
 
04:29:56.429 --> 04:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
exact um 75% it'll probably be a mix and
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
Mary CL behind me might have some
 
04:30:00.269 --> 04:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
additional information if you want to
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
talk about that but we'll be working on
 
04:30:04.269 --> 04:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
the cost allocation methodology as we go
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
forward would that be something that
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be in your um 2627 operating
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
budget or is it too soon to have that
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
because it's you're still maybe only
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
halfway through the project you we would
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate this one we would not
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate any operating expense in the
 
04:30:22.469 --> 04:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
next panium uh we do anticipate some
 
04:30:24.109 --> 04:30:24.119 align:start position:0%
operating expense from the system
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
integrator because that should be
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
implemented prior to the end of um next
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
year and so you'll see some some
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
operating from the current B anum's um
 
04:30:42.109 --> 04:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay did you
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
have okay so then SL slide four the
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
modernized eligibility system Services
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll hear me say New Hampshire
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
easy or New Heights um those are our fun
 
04:30:57.309 --> 04:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
terms for the integrated eligibility and
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment solution that um enables
 
04:30:59.880 --> 04:31:00.910 align:start position:0%
enrollment solution that um enables
people

04:31:00.910 --> 04:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
to um take advantage of or not or or
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
apply for and be um determined for
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
eligibility for Medicaid tanif snap and
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
childcare and Wick programming
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
um it also supports recently we
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
implemented the developmental
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities and we're moving in the
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
aging and adult population system into
 
04:31:21.319 --> 04:31:22.309 align:start position:0%
aging and adult population system into
that

04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
platform so one of the challenges we
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
have is that platform we've had it for a
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
little over what is it 24 years 25 years
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we contined to we've gone out to RP
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
twice in that time frame we continue to
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
enhance it and rep platform it to
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
maintain the health of that system but
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we haven't done
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
is really modernize and take advantage
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the digital um environment that we
 
04:31:51.189 --> 04:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
could do today so for people to provide
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
U to um apply for services they have to
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
download a PDF and they can fill it in
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then they submit it whereas most
 
04:32:00.990 --> 04:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies today you can type in the
 
04:32:02.910 --> 04:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
information online click the submit and
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
it it puts it into the system and it's
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
more of a self-service F function ours
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
is a little bit more manual processing
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
where they fill out their application
 
04:32:13.149 --> 04:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
they submit and then it goes to a person
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
to move it forward this Capital project
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
will allow for that digital self-service
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
um function to do multiple things
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
complaint and inquiry management but
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
also manage thirdparty
 
04:32:29.309 --> 04:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
verifications do um really focus on our
 
04:32:32.910 --> 04:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
Outreach using um SMS or text messaging
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
as well as email
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
Communications and then as I was talking
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
about forums dig
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
digitization really that's a a barrier
 
04:32:43.710 --> 04:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people that are used to
 
04:32:46.750 --> 04:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
technology I would say we will always
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
offer a paper process because it's
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
required by our federal Partners there
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
will always be an in-person option a
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
phone option and all the other options
 
04:32:57.630 --> 04:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
but a large majority of our
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are moving to cell phones
 
04:33:03.630 --> 04:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
and internet-based services and so we're
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
trying to meet people where they're
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
at so I just wanted to add um this is a
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
critical uh piece Dave can speak to the
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
um technology side of it but this is a
 
04:33:16.029 --> 04:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
real pinch point for the Department in
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
terms of determining eligibility in a
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
timely fashion so we're managing a lot
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
of consentuous um complaints and
 
04:33:24.189 --> 04:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
concerns about that and part of that is
 
04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh updating the system to be um in part
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
with in power with what the demand has
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
been so we automation is going to be one
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
way to speed that up um because we just
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the workforce right now to be
 
04:33:42.429 --> 04:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
and again this one has a different um
 
04:33:47.551 --> 04:33:47.561 align:start position:0%
Federal match so because of the
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
different programs that it supports and
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
like I was talking about um snap um
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
which is food stamps and TANF which is
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
cash assistance and um Medicaid and then
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
you have childcare Wick and then
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities all of our
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
federal Partners give us different
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
funding based off of what their um
 
04:34:07.510 --> 04:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
parameters are so you'll see that
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
Federal match is
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay Todd you want to come up and talk
 
04:34:24.070 --> 04:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
to and I'm going to pass this over to
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
Todd really quick to speak to the Glen
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
system so as Todd's joining I just want
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
to preface that as we all know we're
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
looking as Charlie knows we're looking
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
at all safety throughout all of our
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
facilities so Glen Cliff is no exception
 
04:34:42.189 --> 04:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
to that um and we do have some
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
vulnerable points here that uh need to
 
04:34:47.629 --> 04:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
be addressed let Todd speak to that
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Todd bicker the uh executive
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
director of Glencliff home um thank you
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
for having me um this project is to
 
04:34:58.109 --> 04:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
expand um a uh infant system that we
 
04:35:01.310 --> 04:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
currently have um in 2017 we were able
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
to um install some interior cameras and
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
some magnetic locks on our doors um but
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to fully do our whole
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
campus um if you've ever been to GL home
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're pretty expansive we have 70 acres
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
and 22 buildings right now the two
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
resident buildings have the cameras in
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the locked doors um but we weren't
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
able to do the exterior or the other
 
04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
buildings um and again
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's most of the buildings are
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
connected by tunnels there's 22
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
entrances to the resident areas and not
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
all of them are secure um and that does
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
not include the administration building
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
and meance buildings and all those other
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
buildings so this project is uh kind of
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
a combination of adding more cameras
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh adding more locked doors and then
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
expanding the wi-fi system right now we
 
04:35:49.150 --> 04:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
only have Wi-Fi in the Resident areas
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere else on campus and again if
 
04:35:52.590 --> 04:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
you've ever been to Glen clap we are
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
kind of remote we have no cell phone
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
coverage so right now if God forbid we
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
were to have an incident that similar to
 
04:36:00.189 --> 04:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
what happened in New Hampshire hospital
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
areas wouldn't know um the laundry the
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
maintenance um other areas like that the
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
administration building would not be
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
made aware because there's no Universal
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
way to communicate to all of our staff
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
so this is like I said kind of a
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
combination of adding more um hard
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
barriers to exter exterior threats and
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
then um opening of communication so if
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
there we can have a better response to
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
any crisis it also um is would be
 
04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful with the outside
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
cameras in case there's an internal
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
crisis such as a resident trying to
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
alope um or wander off right now we
 
04:36:35.551 --> 04:36:35.561 align:start position:0%
would be able to identify which door
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
they went out but then that would be it
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so if we had some exterior cameras
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
then we'd be able to say see which dire
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
them I have a small question how what's
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
your current population uh today we're
 
04:36:56.670 --> 04:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
at 71 um we have been capping our census
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
at 75 um out of 120 beds uh due to
 
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh we're still running about a
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
40% vacancy rate for nurses and lnas
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's a big issue everywhere I think um
 
04:37:10.709 --> 04:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
is um you have no cell phone coverage I
 
04:37:14.590 --> 04:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
this is a dumb technical question um but
 
04:37:18.109 --> 04:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm here to ask the dumb questions
 
04:37:22.510 --> 04:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
um is is there no modern technology
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
where you
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
could put a thing that creates like a
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
mini hotspot kind of do you know what I
 
04:37:34.109 --> 04:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
mean uh so I'm I'm at the same level as
 
04:37:36.510 --> 04:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
you as technology okay um we might have
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
to ask Dennis this is where we turn to
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
Dennis and yes I think it's a dead zone
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
issue too isn't it yes
 
04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
so so you can't wire into something and
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
create like a small
 
04:37:49.629 --> 04:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
Zone um yes yeah you can do almost
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything with the appropriate amount of
 
04:37:51.920 --> 04:37:53.830 align:start position:0%
anything with the appropriate amount of
money

04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
oh well that's well
 
04:38:00.310 --> 04:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
put we we have tried some of the lower
 
04:38:03.390 --> 04:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
price like boosters um and you know we
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
can maybe get one bar on the top floor
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
right corner of the building um kind of
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
thing it doesn't work in my house either
 
04:38:10.480 --> 04:38:15.629 align:start position:0%
thing it doesn't work in my house either
yeah

04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.639 --> 04:38:22.709 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
you continuing on the the next slide um
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
adrc I apologize for the acronym it's
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
aging disability Resource Center um
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
information and referral system sorry oh
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
and the the more common name that you
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
will hear that informational referral
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
system called is service link and
 
04:38:45.789 --> 04:38:45.799 align:start position:0%
basically what that service link system
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
does is it connects um our aging
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
population with services and it's really
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
providing that information referral for
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
about just under 14,000 clients uh use
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
that caregiver program and that
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
solution's been in place for a little
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
over a decade actually probably more
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
like 15 years and it's been aging out
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
and and so we've been trying to submit
 
04:39:13.869 --> 04:39:13.879 align:start position:0%
Capital Pro program to replace that
 
04:39:16.830 --> 04:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
system so that we could maintain the
 
04:39:19.629 --> 04:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
services but then leveraging tools like
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
the system integrator from the mees
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
program that we were talking about
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
earlier we would interface it with our
 
04:39:27.869 --> 04:39:27.879 align:start position:0%
other systems so that we can understand
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
how people are getting admitted
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
discharged and transfer between
 
04:39:34.109 --> 04:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
facilities as well as how they could get
 
04:39:36.390 --> 04:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
referrals for other services using other
 
04:39:39.230 --> 04:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
programs that we have in place so this
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
this system will really be focusing on
 
04:39:45.270 --> 04:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
building that um solution to support
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
that individual and family directions
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
and and create that continuous quality
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
improvement for the client's needs I
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
think you have could you tell that I was
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
hovering over my microphone I wanted to
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
say something I just what I wanted to
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
point out is that we're uh in the middle
 
04:40:04.110 --> 04:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
of implementing uh legislation from not
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
this session but last session regarding
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
establishing a system of care for Elder
 
04:40:10.590 --> 04:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
uh for long-term support services so
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
this system is critical uh
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to running that system so
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
as as much as we also have the things
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
that we need to do we're required to
 
04:40:20.830 --> 04:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
have the system to run this Tech system
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
to run that uh system of care that we're
 
04:40:23.280 --> 04:40:27.110 align:start position:0%
to run that uh system of care that we're
standing

04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
up I would just note that um we're
 
04:40:32.310 --> 04:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
here's where we really miss Senator
 
04:40:34.590 --> 04:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
delandro because he would he would at
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
this point give us a lecture on the
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
history of service link and how he was
 
04:40:40.510 --> 04:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
here when it was implemented and I I
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
know I know that that's actually
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
something very near and dear to him and
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
the good news let's assume that was s
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
and he's across the hall if you want to
 
04:40:49.868 --> 04:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
go hear it the good news is that we we
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
share the service link because we're
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
using the new acronym and the new name
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
and improving the whole system that is
 
04:40:57.470 --> 04:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
long overdue for a rehaul so he would be
 
04:40:57.480 --> 04:41:01.590 align:start position:0%
long overdue for a rehaul so he would be
happy

04:41:01.590 --> 04:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.390 --> 04:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually so the the next slide is
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
multilanguage support for client notices
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
and this is really again another
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
addition to the new heights um
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility and enrollment
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
system and one of the components there
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
is we're currently in violation of
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
several rights in terms of providing
 
04:41:22.350 --> 04:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
notices in different U languages in our
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
state so 4.7% of our population doesn't
 
04:41:29.788 --> 04:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
speak English however we are obligated
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
to translate um our notices into at
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
least the primary the primary and
 
04:41:37.868 --> 04:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
secondary spoken language which is
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
Spanish as the secondary so this will
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
allow us to be compliant with the
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
federal requirements to support the use
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
of certain languages for communication
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it specifically allows for people
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
that don't speak English to be able to
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
read the notice and understand that they
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
were determinant and eligible for a
 
04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
service and what the steps are that they
 
04:42:01.390 --> 04:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
need to take in order to become eligible
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
for those
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
services this one is another one of
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
those um Capital butt projects that we
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
can seek 90% federal funds um to
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
implement and so it would have a general
 
04:42:14.350 --> 04:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
fund impact of
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
$121,500 and a total dollar of
 
04:42:19.480 --> 04:42:21.110 align:start position:0%
$121,500 and a total dollar of
1,215

04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
1,215
 
04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
236 this is a very exacting number
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
because we have an existing contract
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
with the vendor and we we know what the
 
04:42:30.030 --> 04:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
cost would be for this solution we would
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
need to seek an amendment for to for
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
work and then the next um Capital
 
04:42:41.470 --> 04:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
project um that we have is a doent
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
management and
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
retention so this is really um focused
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
at supporting document management and
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
retention for the whole department we
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
have an existing system um that we
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
leverage for document management and
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
retention and it's been focused on Child
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
Care um sorry child support um children
 
04:43:01.628 --> 04:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
youth and families long-term supports
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
and services and integrated eligibility
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
this would allow us to expand it to the
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
remaining um parts of our department to
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
allow for not only the ability to retain
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
records the way we are supposed to where
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have different um amounts of time in
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
order to retain them but able to re
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
access those records in a timely fashion
 
04:43:25.868 --> 04:43:25.878 align:start position:0%
for different solutions like right to no
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
requests for 91a litigation requests um
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
associated with any type of court
 
04:43:35.788 --> 04:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
hearing um as well as um moving forward
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
with providing case management support
 
04:43:39.788 --> 04:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
for individuals to be able to retrieve
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
that information in a
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
manner this is one of those um projects
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we've been implementing
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
incrementally at over the many years and
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
this would get us over the hump to be
 
04:43:52.708 --> 04:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
able to move forward for the whole
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
department um for doing document
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
management and
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
retention the the funding on this one is
 
04:44:02.670 --> 04:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
estimated at 50% federal funds and this
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's because we would be seeking funds
 
04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
across multiple divisions with um
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
and just to um reiterate it would be
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
really focused on retrieving data for
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
right to know if I didn't I if I did
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
miss that I apologize um but want to
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that I know we're all spending
 
04:44:25.230 --> 04:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on on Discovery and and
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
finding a way to automate it obviously
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
saves staff time um that work not that
 
04:44:31.310 --> 04:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're taking away from doing other
 
04:44:31.320 --> 04:44:32.190 align:start position:0%
we're taking away from doing other
things

04:44:32.190 --> 04:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
so with with the the 50% looks like
 
04:44:37.868 --> 04:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
Federal match on this where's what
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
federal program is there that's
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
providing US money for documentation for
 
04:44:44.750 --> 04:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
for document
 
04:44:47.430 --> 04:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
retention so most of our federal
 
04:44:50.110 --> 04:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
programs require us to maintain records
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
and so the way we would write the um
 
04:44:55.470 --> 04:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
proposal to center for Medicare Medicaid
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
services as well as Administration for
 
04:44:59.350 --> 04:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
Children and Families those are the two
 
04:45:01.628 --> 04:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
primary Federal Partners would be that
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
in order to implement these systems that
 
04:45:06.590 --> 04:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
we have sort um the Medicaid enterprise
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
system as well as the grant families or
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
Bridges solution that supports dcy
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
we need to maintain our documents and
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
and have that record retention component
 
04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
and natively applications don't do
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
document retention you need a separate
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
system to do that that basically you say
 
04:45:26.590 --> 04:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
this is a record it has a seven-year
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
retention after seven years destroy it
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
and it's not up it's not up to a case
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
manager to make that decision it's
 
04:45:36.628 --> 04:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
usually in law that says this is how
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
long you're allowed to retain a record
 
04:45:40.190 --> 04:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
medical records have a certain
 
04:45:43.230 --> 04:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
determination of time and we have that
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
at the state level um we have a the
 
04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
state librarian has published a a record
 
04:45:50.990 --> 04:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
retention schedule that we're obligated
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
to follow but without this type of
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
solution it's really up to individuals
 
04:45:57.910 --> 04:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
to figure out is this a 7 year or threee
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
20 year lifetime record it's really
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to manage with the
 
04:46:05.470 --> 04:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
millions of records that we man that we
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
handle on a daily basis so I don't know
 
04:46:10.030 --> 04:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
if I answered your question but most of
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the funding would be coming the matching
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
dollars would be coming from
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
Administration for children families and
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.628 --> 04:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
services and for the remaining two um
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
capital projects I was going to bring up
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.080 --> 04:46:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
hospital

04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:46:39.670 --> 04:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
need good afternoon my name is Ellen Leo
 
04:46:45.628 --> 04:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
I'm the CEO at New Hampshire hospital
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
and I get to give the elevator speech um
 
04:46:53.190 --> 04:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
I couldn't resist I'm sorry so uh I
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring to your attention the
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS elevator Replacements uh four of
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
them are located at New Hampshire
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
hospital two of them are located at the
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
Anna Philbrook building which New
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital um has oversight of
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
for the past uh 3 years or so and is
 
04:47:13.390 --> 04:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
actually at Glen Cliff home and Todd of
 
04:47:14.910 --> 04:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
course is here if you have questions
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
about that one um but the concern is
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
that all of these elevators are original
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
to both New Hampshire hospital and the
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
Philbrook building so the four New
 
04:47:27.868 --> 04:47:27.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital elevators were um put
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
in in early
 
04:47:33.230 --> 04:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
1980s and we are not looking for total
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
elevator replacement what we're really
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
looking for is
 
04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
modernization um to both the uh controls
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
and the power functions of these
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
elevators so that they can stay in
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
service we have unfortunately had
 
04:47:49.230 --> 04:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
several occasions on a frequent basis
 
04:47:52.030 --> 04:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
where one or more of these elevators are
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
out of service for a significant length
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
of time and they do disrupt patient care
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
as you can see three of them are
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
passenger elevators which patients do
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
utilize and one of them is our freight
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
elevator which is required to move
 
04:48:09.150 --> 04:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
supplies and equipment throughout the
 
04:48:09.160 --> 04:48:10.910 align:start position:0%
supplies and equipment throughout the
facility

04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the two elevators at
 
04:48:17.230 --> 04:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
the Anna Philbrook building um they are
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
also original to that facility and are
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
that much more aged having been put in
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
in the mid
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
1960s um these elevators are accessible
 
04:48:31.628 --> 04:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
to both patients who reside in the NFI
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
Pathways program as well as to staff and
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
we do have um members of staff at that
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
building who are employed by New
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital who who who do
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
require utilization of the elevator due
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
to their
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities um so in general in that
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
elevator those elevators one of them in
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
particular has been down uh for the past
 
04:48:56.510 --> 04:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
several weeks due to inability to repair
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
it and um obtain Parts given its age so
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
these are of a significant need for us
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide appropriate
 
04:49:03.600 --> 04:49:06.750 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide appropriate
patient

04:49:06.750 --> 04:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
care I have a question on that maybe
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
this is a question that uh commissioner
 
04:49:14.430 --> 04:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
Arling house might be able to answer and
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
that is you have these requests in in
 
04:49:19.708 --> 04:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
your capital budget for these elevators
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
there's another request for the Brown
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
building elevators and the
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner's Bud capital budget
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
request why are some of hhs's elevators
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
coming from admin services and why are
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
some coming from HHS want me to do that
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
let see who can hit the button first um
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
the uh admin Services man manages uh
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
most state buildings we generally do not
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
manage the state buildings in which
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
people sleep on purpose um so um we call
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
it patient care well I was trying to
 
04:49:55.948 --> 04:49:55.958 align:start position:0%
include Helen as well which isn't always
 
04:49:59.070 --> 04:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
patient care but um so uh New Hampshire
 
04:50:01.708 --> 04:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
hospital um because Anna Philbrook which
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
we used to manage and don't anymore is a
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh is a patient building now and then
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
transitional housings on the campus and
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
then Sena Center Glen
 
04:50:14.070 --> 04:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
and something else which doesn't come to
 
04:50:15.390 --> 04:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
Veterans Hampstead and newshire
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital veterans
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
home so
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
Brown we take care of and the elevator
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
is just as bad I mean I I I feel I don't
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
mean to minimize how bad the elevators
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
are but um State elevators are a couple
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
of these I'm like wow that's bad and a
 
04:50:33.390 --> 04:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
couple of them I'm like okay I don't
 
04:50:52.030 --> 04:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
hello again um I'm back up for I believe
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
which is the last one which is the
 
04:50:59.788 --> 04:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
Glencliff home fuel system upgrade it's
 
04:51:02.670 --> 04:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward um this is our
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
gas station basically that we have on
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
campus um that is over 28 years old and
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
it has um failed numerous inspections
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
but they have grandfathered it in
 
04:51:16.990 --> 04:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that our system is no longer
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
able to provide um Parts last time we
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
repaired it we had to go to a DOT shop
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
that was decommissioning one of their
 
04:51:24.910 --> 04:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
pumps and we stole some of the
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
components from borrowed some of the
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
components from them um basically uh we
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
have a fleet of 22 vehicles that we
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
maintain uh if we did not have this
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
source of fuel we would have to drive to
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
the nearest gas station and pay probably
 
04:51:44.350 --> 04:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
15 to 20% more per gallon plus the time
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
of Staff in mileage um so this would
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
replace the pumps replace the tanks
 
04:51:54.430 --> 04:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
replace the um spill management system
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
and currently the old pump is literally
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the middle of our grounds parking um
 
04:52:02.670 --> 04:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
area with a telephone pull and low hung
 
04:52:04.548 --> 04:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
wires which about 3 years ago did get
 
04:52:05.948 --> 04:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
knocked down by a truck that went
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
through there so this would put all of
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
that type of things underground and make
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
it a much more safe um parking lot
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
area and just for those that don't know
 
04:52:16.948 --> 04:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's a self- sustaining campus so the
 
04:52:18.670 --> 04:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
reason why they have they do everything
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
I mean they generate their own
 
04:52:21.628 --> 04:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
electricity and take care of everything
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
on site do our own snow plowing and all
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
things thank you very much don't see any
 
04:52:33.628 --> 04:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
have questions so thank you very much
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%

right is Heidi laramy our administrator
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
of logistics it is my great privilege to
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
talk to you about the capital budget
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the Department of
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
Corrections um the PowerPoint uh that
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're passing out before you on slide
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
two is literally a summary of the 15
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
priority projects I'm going to talk
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
about uh today and I wanted to emphasize
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
the total amount saved for deferred
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
projects if the state moves forward with
 
04:53:39.788 --> 04:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
replacing the New Hampshire state prison
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
for men is a approximately $91
 
04:53:45.270 --> 04:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
million uh cost of projects that we
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
believe we cannot uh postpone is $18.7
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
million and of that 8 $18.7 million
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
there may be another 7 million we could
 
04:53:55.948 --> 04:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
postpone and I'll talk about that as we
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
go through the
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
presentation U moving on to the next
 
04:54:02.830 --> 04:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
slide our priority number one project
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I would like to pause and take a
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
moment and thank Senator gray is a prime
 
04:54:07.948 --> 04:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor of a bill that put forward
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
legislation this year uh that received
 
04:54:10.200 --> 04:54:10.910 align:start position:0%
legislation this year uh that received
the

04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:12.868 --> 04:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
support of the legislature in a unique
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
roundabout way but a $40 million
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
allocation will be headed to the
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
governor's desk to continue the groundw
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to do to diligently put a
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
cost proposal forward to the state to
 
04:54:25.310 --> 04:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
replace the New Hampshire state prison
 
04:54:28.670 --> 04:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
for men um that is priority number one
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
the original structures built in
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
1878 um are still being used uh and in
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
addition to our reception and diagnostic
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
area originally built in 1940 referred
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
to as the annex is still in use every
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
single day um as the primary booking
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
location for men who are incarcerated
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
with in Hampshire Department of
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections there were major Renovations
 
04:54:50.910 --> 04:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
1980s uh to our special housing unit our
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
closed custody unit our secure
 
04:54:57.070 --> 04:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit our residential
 
04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
treatment unit um and it continued on
 
04:55:01.230 --> 04:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
with our medium custody North medium
 
04:55:03.430 --> 04:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
custody South so on and so forth with
 
04:55:05.708 --> 04:55:05.718 align:start position:0%
our Hancock building coming in the
 
04:55:09.390 --> 04:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
1990s uh newer uh industry Renovations
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
and buildings and some you know they
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
there's a hodge podge of infrastructure
 
04:55:16.868 --> 04:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
on that campus and as a result uh we
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
continue to see physical plant uh
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
surprises like I've never seen
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
architecturally including ramps that are
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
roofs uh that are over our kitchen area
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
um ramps that are roof over staff entry
 
04:55:32.590 --> 04:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
points into facilities um mold
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
remediation projects that uh occur that
 
04:55:38.670 --> 04:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
I have to find paths forward to um roofs
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
literally being blown off
 
04:55:45.230 --> 04:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
um we have actually um we
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
have short block veneer that is mounted
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
to concrete and the bolts that secure
 
04:55:52.750 --> 04:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
that veneer to the concrete are rusted
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
away some of those uh are 35 ft High we
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor those for fear
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to fall off the concrete
 
04:56:04.548 --> 04:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
walls um the the laundry list of issues
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
on that campus is significant and I I do
 
04:56:09.150 --> 04:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
want to continue to remind people the
 
04:56:10.510 --> 04:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
mission of the Department of Correction
 
04:56:12.750 --> 04:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
is provide infrastructure that's
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative safe and Humane and I'm
 
04:56:17.788 --> 04:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
going to continue to Advocate to replace
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
the newshire state prison for men so we
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
meet that mission we can have a facility
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
that is efficient with technology that
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
affords staff on a day like this where
 
04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're sitting in an air conditioned
 
04:56:30.430 --> 04:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
Suite uh the New Hampshire state prison
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
for men's staff are working hard 247 in
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
hot ruling locations in addition to the
 
04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
individuals incarcerated in that
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um
 
04:56:43.390 --> 04:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
so I I will not continue on because I
 
04:56:45.310 --> 04:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
know this is first of many conversations
 
04:56:46.270 --> 04:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
project priority number two is
 
04:56:51.310 --> 04:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
additional funding for our steam lines
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
and traps it is clear uh as we've worked
 
04:56:56.750 --> 04:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
through existing steamline projects we
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
have sub continue to have substantial
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
leaks um and mechanical issues that have
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
been found because our partners uh in
 
04:57:05.070 --> 04:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
conquered are letting us know that we
 
04:57:07.708 --> 04:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
have abnormally high water usage um and
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're finding those leaks in the
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
existing project we can continue to need
 
04:57:13.230 --> 04:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
to replace the steam lines uh some of
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
those Pathways also still date back to
 
04:57:18.830 --> 04:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
1878 uh those projects are expensive uh
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
because you have to dig through the
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
concrete yard uh and all sorts of coal
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
Pockets that pre-exist that physical uh
 
04:57:26.638 --> 04:57:29.110 align:start position:0%
Pockets that pre-exist that physical uh
plants

04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
plants
 
04:57:31.230 --> 04:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I think the pictures
 
04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
really speak for
 
04:57:35.150 --> 04:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
themselves priority number three I'm
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to take a Twist on you and talk
 
04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
about our New Hampshire correctional
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
facility for men in Berlin it is time to
 
04:57:42.670 --> 04:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
replace the body alarm system that is
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
called a personal duress system I also
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
call it a manown system um the company
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
Bosch that provided our original system
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
in 2000 no longer uh provides this
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
product you cannot buy this product it
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
is a primary defense for our staff and
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
that institution to alert that they are
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
in duress and they need emergency
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
response uh so our Correctional line
 
04:58:07.868 --> 04:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
Personnel who are nurses or social
 
04:58:10.548 --> 04:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
workers or case managers or teachers
 
04:58:12.910 --> 04:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
these systems are critical when you run
 
04:58:14.990 --> 04:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
a correctional institution we replace
 
04:58:17.548 --> 04:58:17.558 align:start position:0%
about 20 a year uh and we need to
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
upgrade this product so we continue to
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
provide safety resources to the staff uh
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated within that
 
04:58:28.750 --> 04:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
institution priority number four is the
 
04:58:30.548 --> 04:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men see how I
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
brought you back to that infrastructure
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh talking about our electronic controls
 
04:58:36.548 --> 04:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
and our camera installation this is
 
04:58:38.190 --> 04:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
really part number two of a
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
facility-wide replacement of our old
 
04:58:43.548 --> 04:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
analog to a digital uh system there's a
 
04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
lot of money um that needs to be spent
 
04:58:48.990 --> 04:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
on wiring digital head-in equipment uh
 
04:58:51.190 --> 04:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
these are uh belong in a museum as you
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
can see on priority number four uh we
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
ran short of money to complete that
 
04:58:57.788 --> 04:58:57.798 align:start position:0%
project and so this amount of money
 
04:59:00.030 --> 04:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
would afford US to replace approximately
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
301 uh cameras these are absolutely
 
04:59:05.868 --> 04:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
critical for both transparency awareness
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
we continue to pass our prison rape
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
elimination act audit because we can see
 
04:59:11.708 --> 04:59:11.718 align:start position:0%
things and places that are critically
 
04:59:14.190 --> 04:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
important and this continues to build on
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
that I was just in the institution last
 
04:59:19.390 --> 04:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
week a fight broke out if we did not
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
have the cameras we could not have seen
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
what the instigation event was we could
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
not be able we would not be able to move
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
forward and press charges for the
 
04:59:29.788 --> 04:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
assault on my staff um so these cameras
 
04:59:31.708 --> 04:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
augment the safety of the institution
 
04:59:34.830 --> 04:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're priority number
 
04:59:38.110 --> 04:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
four priority number five is to replace
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
the fire alarm systems uh uh Miss laramy
 
04:59:43.110 --> 04:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
came forward to let me know this fine
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
news uh this is for approximately
 
04:59:48.868 --> 04:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
400,000 square fet of fire alarm systems
 
04:59:50.628 --> 04:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
across both the Men's prison campus
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
transitional housing units and some
 
04:59:54.430 --> 04:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
other docc facilities what we have
 
04:59:55.628 --> 04:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
learned from working with several
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
outside vendors is that from previous
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
work we found a myriad of issues of
 
05:00:01.830 --> 05:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
wiring injunction boxes that have no
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
Rhyme or Reason that we um don't
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand how they were Wired from one
 
05:00:08.670 --> 05:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
place to another uh it is failing and it
 
05:00:10.990 --> 05:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
creates false alarms uh does not give us
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
the solidarity that a fire alarm when it
 
05:00:14.948 --> 05:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
goes off is truly a fire we don't need
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
to create emergencies in an institution
 
05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
where an emergency is something we take
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh very clearly um at the Forefront of
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
our work um this uh project will replace
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
existing systems put in new code
 
05:00:30.750 --> 05:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
compliant uh fire alarm systems and
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
obviously that's a critical issue when
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
you have 1,500 people charged in your
 
05:00:37.750 --> 05:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility on our Southern
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
campus priority number six used to be
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
the HVAC units that use R2 refrigerant
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
R2 refrigerant was federally banned by
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
the EPA in 2010 it had a 10-year plan
 
05:00:53.548 --> 05:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
where in 2020 they were no longer
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
legally allowed to produce our 2020 the
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
only thing you can do now is get
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
reclaimed r2020 for systems that they're
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking down and use used
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
r2020 um so we need to replace at least
 
05:01:09.390 --> 05:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
eight large HVAC units on the New
 
05:01:10.830 --> 05:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men and their
 
05:01:12.590 --> 05:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
related components to continue to
 
05:01:16.230 --> 05:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
provide air filtration system on that
 
05:01:18.910 --> 05:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
campus priority number seven is to
 
05:01:20.948 --> 05:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
replace the reception and diagnostic
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
building and the diagnostic reception
 
05:01:26.670 --> 05:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
and diagnostic building houses over 120
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
individuals it's capable of doing that
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
um the building is referred to as a van
 
05:01:34.830 --> 05:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
dorm style building I can hear John
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hansen's voice in my head he is very
 
05:01:39.390 --> 05:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
interested in this aged architecture it
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
does not exist anywhere else uh it is
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
definitely a historical location um and
 
05:01:49.230 --> 05:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
it has uh challenges both in that there
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
are the bars themselves in an area where
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
the risk of suicide is already imminent
 
05:01:55.868 --> 05:01:55.878 align:start position:0%
because you're newly booked or returning
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
that is scientifically demonstrated
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
through Corrections you can tie things
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
on here it is not an automated or
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
electrical system you have to use levers
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
to pop these doors open and those are no
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
longer reliable the chase ways for rep
 
05:02:11.788 --> 05:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
are a challenge the plumbing in this
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
space is a challenge we are challenged
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
to find someone to repair current leak
 
05:02:20.910 --> 05:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to U the exterior walls
 
05:02:23.190 --> 05:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
have cracks you can see through we're
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
challenged wondering about the brick
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
veneer on the outside um this space
 
05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
period it doesn't even afford US proper
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
processes to properly screen newly
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
booked individuals um you know we've had
 
05:02:43.350 --> 05:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
instances where people have uh almost
 
05:02:45.548 --> 05:02:45.558 align:start position:0%
brought in cell phones and other items
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
just yesterday in a tragic uh news event
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the Georgia Department of Corrections
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
someone brought in a handgun that was
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
used to kill a kitchen worker in their
 
05:02:56.670 --> 05:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
Correctional institution and some of
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
those things happen literally because
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have good screening procedures
 
05:03:03.670 --> 05:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
processes and physical plant um we need
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
to remove those challenges and enhance
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
the security and safety in these
 
05:03:08.910 --> 05:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
institutions there are real tragedies we
 
05:03:11.430 --> 05:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
can avoid
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
priority number seven uh I already did
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
that one didn't I I'm just showing you
 
05:03:18.548 --> 05:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
more pictures priority number eight this
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
one seems really little uh this is a
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
5,000 uh gallon non-compliant diesel
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
tank we want to remove this underground
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
diesel storage tank it leaks uh it needs
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
to be taken away it has um lasted they
 
05:03:39.470 --> 05:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
what has the they last about 25 years I
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
mention to guess how long you think
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's been there um it was installed in
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
1994 so it is beyond its useful life we
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
want to replace it actually with an
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
above ground storage uh diesel tank for
 
05:03:53.830 --> 05:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
the use uh right outside our warehouse
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
facility moving on to Priority number
 
05:04:01.948 --> 05:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
nine we have been working steadily
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
through the guidance of the Department
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
of Labor with commissioner Maryfield to
 
05:04:07.470 --> 05:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
replace our boilers this is the last of
 
05:04:10.750 --> 05:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
three boilers that we need to uh provide
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
steam to the conquered Men's prison it
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
is beyond its repair and uh needs to be
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
replaced the boiler is over 40 years old
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's a Cleaver Brooks tube style boiler
 
05:04:22.868 --> 05:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh those typically have a life
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
expectancy of 25 years so we've really
 
05:04:28.030 --> 05:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
gotten our money's worth at this point
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
um the Dr Rader and surge uh tanks are
 
05:04:33.150 --> 05:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
also 40 years old and they also are
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
prone to leaking so we need to replace
 
05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
that priority number 10 continues around
 
05:04:41.070 --> 05:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
our security perimeter systems and
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
fences at the New Hampshire state prison
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
for men wall and detection systems
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
clearly it's our first point of
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
awareness both of somebody's trying to
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
get out and that somebody who's not
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to come in is trying to come in
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
we did receive an apportionment uh but
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
that only took us a short distance of
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
linear feet and we continue to have
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
infrastructure problems on our fence
 
05:05:01.708 --> 05:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
detection that I will not go into public
 
05:05:01.718 --> 05:05:05.030 align:start position:0%
detection that I will not go into public
detail

05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.830 --> 05:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
on priority number 11 is a sample of one
 
05:05:10.230 --> 05:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
of many control rooms at the New
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men so as you
 
05:05:15.190 --> 05:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
can imagine working in a space um and I
 
05:05:16.830 --> 05:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
I think she politely took out the part
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
where there's an actual toilet in that
 
05:05:20.190 --> 05:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
space and in some spaces there is no
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
toilet um individuals who are working in
 
05:05:25.390 --> 05:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
these 24-hour spaces the technology that
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
we've Advanced is good but the spaces in
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
which we've put them do not have air uh
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
or cooling control so we are actually
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
causing a risk to the efficiency we're
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
getting by adding technology because we
 
05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't have enough HVAC and
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure control to to cool and de
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
dehumidify the spaces when a staff
 
05:05:44.470 --> 05:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
member is in a control room where there
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
is no facilities they wait over
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 minutes to be relieved
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
to go relieve themselves um and we need
 
05:05:53.788 --> 05:05:53.798 align:start position:0%
to create a better system uh as we look
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
at these control rooms and try to help
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
staff uh work through the nuances of the
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
old agent infrastructure and we need to
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that the technology we've
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
implemented uh continues to be a
 
05:06:04.990 --> 05:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
resource and that we don't degrade it
 
05:06:08.270 --> 05:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
because our fiscal plant is doing
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
that uh priority number 12 is to replace
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
the electrical
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
Transformers uh we've had those uh hip
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
hipi lightning in 2017 one of my first
 
05:06:21.868 --> 05:06:21.878 align:start position:0%
moments uh working with commissioner
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
Arling house uh it was struck by
 
05:06:25.868 --> 05:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
lightning I found out the age of those
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
Transformers We also um had a split in
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
electrical lines in the ground where the
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
El the electricity leaked into the
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
ground and individuals could have been
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
electrocuted and died I'm not
 
05:06:38.430 --> 05:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophizing these are the real
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
things that we deal with in correct so
 
05:06:43.708 --> 05:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
please know that um the uh we just had
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
another Transformer uh during a storm
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
event uh blow and we've had to find old
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
Transformers to replace them but
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
ultimately we need to replace the
 
05:06:54.990 --> 05:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
electrical eight electrical Transformers
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
to something current and modern um that
 
05:07:00.030 --> 05:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
is sustainable and that we don't
 
05:07:03.230 --> 05:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
literally have to drive to Ohio to find
 
05:07:06.750 --> 05:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
one uh priority number 13 is a continued
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
request we received arpa funding for our
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
meting custy South and North general
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
population units those house the largest
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
number of individuals at the New
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men uh but we
 
05:07:18.750 --> 05:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
need to continue to work on replacing
 
05:07:20.350 --> 05:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
our air handlers and duck work
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the institution they are
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
rusted they are corroded uh we talked
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
about I shared with you the number of
 
05:07:28.670 --> 05:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
years of architectural builds over time
 
05:07:30.310 --> 05:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
some of these are built in places where
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't connect them correctly
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're actually underrated for the
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
workload they need to produce um they're
 
05:07:39.788 --> 05:07:39.798 align:start position:0%
retrofitted in attic spaces and other
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
spaces that uh have had Rhyme or Reason
 
05:07:44.788 --> 05:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
then but as the infrastructure in the
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
plant expanded they do not now um so
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
many of them need to be upsized and
 
05:07:52.110 --> 05:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
relocated uh but many of them need
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
simply to be replaced because they are
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
imminently falling down or have fallen
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
down they need to have fans Motors belts
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
and other related equipment replaced and
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
they are beyond their
 
05:08:04.830 --> 05:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
repair I'm almost done with this
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
exciting Good News uh priority number 14
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
is to replace the corre grade security
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
Windows vents facility
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
wide Correctional grade windows are not
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
Windows you can just take out and repair
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
like in your home these are uh concrete
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
rebar cemented into the infrastructure
 
05:08:25.628 --> 05:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
purposely done so so you cannot get out
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
of them but in the course of doing that
 
05:08:29.470 --> 05:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
in order to replace them you have to
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
concrete cut through those windows we
 
05:08:33.868 --> 05:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
still need to incarcerate need to then
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
secure back up the window while you
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
replacing the window this is a
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
methodical process that would have to
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
occur across the whole
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
campus uh this project is the one that
 
05:08:46.708 --> 05:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
depending on a rebuild we would try to
 
05:08:49.470 --> 05:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
put it off for as long as we can um in
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
addition these windows are secured so
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
when the self-directed ventilation that
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
is installed in them breaks where the
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
resident can control the air moving in
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
or the air moving out in our four
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
seasoned uh location uh that becomes a
 
05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
problem so if they lock in place and I
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
can't get them open the air moving in
 
05:09:10.270 --> 05:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
and out doesn't continue to happen when
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
it's the winter it's going to happen and
 
05:09:13.470 --> 05:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be cold and we have to try
 
05:09:17.230 --> 05:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
to work around those things this is 832
 
05:09:19.390 --> 05:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
Windows across this campus in all sorts
 
05:09:19.400 --> 05:09:21.150 align:start position:0%
Windows across this campus in all sorts
of

05:09:21.150 --> 05:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
locations um the other very important
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
part these windows um literally it's
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
hard to see through them anymore so line
 
05:09:30.788 --> 05:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
of sight to make sure the things
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
happening in that room or what should be
 
05:09:34.948 --> 05:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
happening become very challenging um and
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
I I can't understate that that's a
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
safety issue as
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
well here we are priority number 15 I
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
told you I was only going to talk about
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
15 of them uh we drive around our campus
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
we drive around our campus we need to
 
05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
repair and repave these roads as I
 
05:09:51.230 --> 05:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
replace our vehicles we are actually
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
damaging our new vehicles because the
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
roads have such poor uh Road quality to
 
05:09:58.990 --> 05:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
them that we're hitting potholes drains
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
um and drain Edge have sunk we have
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
major problems across the perimeter
 
05:10:06.150 --> 05:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
roads we go around and round the road
 
05:10:09.070 --> 05:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
every single day in addition to uh the
 
05:10:10.830 --> 05:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
par parking lots that exist on the
 
05:10:13.150 --> 05:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
campus where both uh staff and those
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
tending parole hearings uh go to those
 
05:10:17.070 --> 05:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
have those are seven parking lots they
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
haven't been paved in over 30 years and
 
05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
some of the initial Paving was literally
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
just a skim coat over a gravel parking
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
lot because that's what they could
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
afford um so the road conditions are
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
causing a damage to our permited
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles they have not been maintained
 
05:10:32.910 --> 05:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
the soils beneath some of the um uh
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
drainage ways need to be examined and
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
replaced and that is what priority
 
05:10:40.750 --> 05:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
number 15 is all about so with that I'm
 
05:10:43.230 --> 05:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer any questions
 
05:10:46.548 --> 05:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
clarify okay or just leave you in
 
05:10:50.708 --> 05:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
a I have many questions um the first one
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
is just to just to get an overview you
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
have the the men's replacement of the
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
Men's prison then you have a lot of
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the existing prison is this
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
an either or do the Men's prison or we
 
05:11:04.548 --> 05:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
need these upgrades or we have these
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to need a Men's prison be
 
05:11:09.350 --> 05:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
built and we need these upgrades now so
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
on the second thank you for that
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
question on the second slide we put an
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
aster next to projects um that we don't
 
05:11:18.750 --> 05:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
feel we can postpone and that again
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
accounts for about 18.7 million that
 
05:11:23.470 --> 05:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
page looks like
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
this that could be potentially Reduce by
 
05:11:28.070 --> 05:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
another 7 million if we can put off the
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
windows project uh but those are things
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to continue to ask for
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
funding for while the uh process occurs
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
regarding a replacement facility for the
 
05:11:39.430 --> 05:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state presis for men so
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
there is about $91 million I can tell
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
you today that depending on the build of
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
that project and moving date we are
 
05:11:48.390 --> 05:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're hopeful of working toward avoiding
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
expending that and using those funds
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
toward a replacement facility rather
 
05:11:54.750 --> 05:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
than the infrastructure we have today
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh this question is is is a bit
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
complicated in the fact that the prison
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
is $580 million you receive $10 million
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
in the budget last year you you're about
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
to get another $40 million from the bill
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray sponsored
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh which leaves you $530 million
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
short um as the governor mentioned in
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
his opening statement we normally give
 
05:12:21.150 --> 05:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
$120 million per per bium and for the
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget which if we gave every
 
05:12:24.788 --> 05:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
penny to The Men's prison that would
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
take about four and a half bi enums or
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
or close to nine years to get it done uh
 
05:12:33.470 --> 05:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
I know you've had conversations both
 
05:12:36.510 --> 05:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
with myself and with the state treasurer
 
05:12:39.310 --> 05:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
um yes if you could Enlighten us on are
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
you working on a plan that that would uh
 
05:12:46.270 --> 05:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
enable you to meet your financing goals
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you V that been working with
 
05:12:49.070 --> 05:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer and her team they've
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
been uh very helpful in understanding
 
05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
this is a unique project for the State
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh we we both agreed verbally that this
 
05:12:59.390 --> 05:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
would require separate legislative
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
language so that the state treasurer
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
could look at something more like a 20
 
05:13:04.990 --> 05:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
or 30 a year and I'm going to equate it
 
05:13:07.390 --> 05:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
to a mortgage or bond in that Essence
 
05:13:10.990 --> 05:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
because the the life expectancy of a new
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
replacement uh facility would outweigh
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
the life of that Bond and the return on
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
investment would would balance that
 
05:13:21.070 --> 05:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
action so she and I are very much um
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
hand inand in discussing how the state
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
could move forward without impacting the
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
current capital budget process but it
 
05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
would have to be supported through
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
separate legislation and a more uh
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted language much like
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
the language we created for the $40
 
05:13:38.350 --> 05:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
million using that concept but also
 
05:13:39.628 --> 05:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
understanding that a new
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
facility given the years and discussions
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
I just had with you would have a lot
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
longer life uh uh than 30 years okay and
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
given the complications here of getting
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
the financing and obviously the
 
05:13:54.750 --> 05:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
complications that will arise and
 
05:13:56.750 --> 05:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually constructing the
 
05:13:59.910 --> 05:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
facility if if everything goes according
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
to the best case scenario time frame you
 
05:14:05.390 --> 05:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
have in your mind what are we looking at
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
for a completion date for this project
 
05:14:10.590 --> 05:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
assuming you can get the the financing
 
05:14:12.510 --> 05:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable amount of time that you
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
would expect and then the construction
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
after that yeah I would work hand inand
 
05:14:18.750 --> 05:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
with members of Ted Copper's team and
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
our experience both learned experience
 
05:14:22.548 --> 05:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
and lived experience with in Hampshire
 
05:14:24.430 --> 05:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
correctional facility for women so that
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
we don't relive things that were not
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
good steps there but I would hope that
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
between the work we're doing now and uh
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
a 10-year period we would be moving very
 
05:14:36.030 --> 05:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
steadily forward to to knowing a movein
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
date um if that is certainly an absurd
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
speculation I want that man to certainly
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
chime in but I think if all hands were
 
05:14:46.590 --> 05:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
involved in moving in an expedition way
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
and there was support for the
 
05:14:50.548 --> 05:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
legislation to fund it um I don't think
 
05:14:53.470 --> 05:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
a 10-year plan would be out of the realm
 
05:14:53.480 --> 05:14:55.150 align:start position:0%
a 10-year plan would be out of the realm
of

05:14:55.150 --> 05:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
possibilities see the nod we good
 
05:15:04.590 --> 05:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:08.590 --> 05:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
questions um hi hi on priority number
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
five on the slide it says all applicable
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
Southern States in parentheses sites
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
yeah sites yeah what does that mean yep
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that's when I discussed that uh it's
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state prison for men our
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
transitional housing units they all need
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
their uh fire alarm systems upgraded and
 
05:15:32.030 --> 05:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
I am forgetting a location so there our
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
transitional work center okay all right
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:42.430 --> 05:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd ask about the
 
05:15:42.440 --> 05:15:45.750 align:start position:0%
I thought I'd ask about the
prison

05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
um um so we built a women's prison
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
recently at least I think it's recently
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
right we moved in in
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
2018 is it that long ago I guess it
 
05:16:00.910 --> 05:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
would be yeah after the locks worked um
 
05:16:04.270 --> 05:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
the uh uh it it's it's one building it's
 
05:16:06.670 --> 05:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
one prison and it houses how many people
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
ballpark it was sized for 2 24 224 and
 
05:16:13.470 --> 05:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
and a new Men's prison would be sized
 
05:16:17.230 --> 05:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
for about so part of the $50 millionar
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
would do the programmatic analysis and
 
05:16:22.590 --> 05:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
look at population progression uh yeah
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
progressions and right now the state
 
05:16:27.510 --> 05:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
prison for men has approximately 1,200
 
05:16:31.150 --> 05:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
people incarcerated there in 2010 and 11
 
05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
if we change any legislation around
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
sentencing we've housed up to 17 to
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
18800 so looking at population is
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely contingent on what the state
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
is doing with regard to felony
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
sentencing would you would you build
 
05:16:48.948 --> 05:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
would you build one
 
05:16:52.750 --> 05:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
prison or would you build
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't know exactly how to express
 
05:16:58.110 --> 05:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm what's in my head but
 
05:17:00.070 --> 05:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
um that mean one of the things that
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
happens is you have it's not one giant
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
building right right um is are there
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
savings to be had I don't mean from a
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
building stand point but operationally
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever from something that
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
resembles modular or you have four
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
buildings on the same site that are you
 
05:17:19.868 --> 05:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
know like you know like you like you go
 
05:17:21.788 --> 05:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
to a big college and they don't except
 
05:17:24.430 --> 05:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
in a really stupid giant State School
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
have one giant dorm right they have like
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
eight yeah does that make some sense is
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
there opportunity there well
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner AR knows your question is
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely um relative to what that $50
 
05:17:38.590 --> 05:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
million will buy us uh one part uh that
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
people people should be aware of when
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
you look at a campus style of of
 
05:17:43.628 --> 05:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
infrastructure where there are multiple
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
buildings you have to look at all the um
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
the plumbing and electrical and all
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
those lines you're creating and then you
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
have to look at the Staffing so if I'm
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing six buildings and I can gain no
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency I'm almost in the same
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
situation I am now um without talking
 
05:18:02.830 --> 05:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
about technology so I'm not going to be
 
05:18:04.270 --> 05:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
able to answer your question about what
 
05:18:06.670 --> 05:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
the right build is but the $50 million
 
05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
is supposed to help us get to that with
 
05:18:10.868 --> 05:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
bid speec documents it's one of the
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
things you're looking at with that to
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
say how can I make a staffing more
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
efficient how can I make if I 1,200
 
05:18:19.628 --> 05:18:19.638 align:start position:0%
people instead of, 1600 people yeah and
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
by nature of having different
 
05:18:23.070 --> 05:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
classification levels where people are
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
more high risk versus low risk there
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
will be a physical plant separation but
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
I'm hesitant to try to speculate on how
 
05:18:32.110 --> 05:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
that would look with buildings at this
 
05:18:34.590 --> 05:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
point and you've seen significant
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
reduction in the number of people
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in the last what 10 15
 
05:18:41.070 --> 05:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
years in that range absolutely we have
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
done a great job as a state in looking
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
at both incarceration rate and Public
 
05:18:48.190 --> 05:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
Safety both through specialty courts and
 
05:18:49.948 --> 05:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
all of the actions across the state to
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
see over a 28% reduction in the overall
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
incursor of
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
population are those largely policy
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
driven or is some of it societal they're
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
policy driven it's also the state uh the
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections deserves
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
accolades we've reduced our recidivism
 
05:19:08.110 --> 05:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
rate by 7% since 2018 and we continue to
 
05:19:09.868 --> 05:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
see a reduction ction because we're
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
targeting one primary area that causes
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
people to return to incarceration and
 
05:19:15.230 --> 05:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's both substance use disorder and
 
05:19:17.948 --> 05:19:17.958 align:start position:0%
substance misuse so both with the work
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing while someone's incarcerated
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and the re-entry work we're doing post
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
relase we're we're reducing people's
 
05:19:25.628 --> 05:19:25.638 align:start position:0%
return to incarceration which has been
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
the state's systemic problem um and in
 
05:19:30.110 --> 05:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
addition to the work we're doing with
 
05:19:31.230 --> 05:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
Services seeking uh centers for Medicaid
 
05:19:36.110 --> 05:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
and Medicare s uh Services waiver under
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
the 1115a to build continued strong
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
Bridges to re-entering the community
 
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're both making great policy decisions
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
but operational decisions and
 
05:19:48.390 --> 05:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration decisions um like the rest
 
05:19:51.310 --> 05:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
of us you have an aging population I
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
think I think that um the way in which
 
05:19:56.350 --> 05:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
people think about age is not the same
 
05:19:59.868 --> 05:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
in incarceration so the life choices
 
05:20:01.868 --> 05:20:01.878 align:start position:0%
that I might engage in if I'm a person
 
05:20:04.750 --> 05:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
who has had repeat interactions with the
 
05:20:06.750 --> 05:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
justice system is going to impact me
 
05:20:09.548 --> 05:20:09.558 align:start position:0%
differently when I'm getting hepatitis C
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
and other um things so I want to be
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
careful that aged Inc Corrections could
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
be more like 55 and not aged like 65
 
05:20:20.230 --> 05:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
plus depending on what that matter is
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
and I know people of all ages that are
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
quite healthy but to the point of the
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
matter we're facing the treatment of
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
chronic illnesses associated with both
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and lack of
 
05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
attention to Health Care issues whether
 
05:20:34.990 --> 05:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's type 2 diabetic hypertension uh
 
05:20:39.190 --> 05:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C HIV um and uh the course of
 
05:20:41.190 --> 05:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
the effect of OB use disorder on the
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
body in in general though your your
 
05:20:46.270 --> 05:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
population has probably um higher Health
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
Care needs than the population as a
 
05:20:52.350 --> 05:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
whole y that is very fair to say and
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
again reminding us that the cost of our
 
05:20:56.430 --> 05:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
healthc care and incarceration is to the
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
general fund um and that Medicaid only
 
05:21:02.628 --> 05:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
covers impatient eligible stays um when
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
when we think of you know a lot of us
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
when we think of a a prison tend to I'm
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to date myself here tend to think
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
of Otis on The Andy Griffith Show right
 
05:21:13.948 --> 05:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
and it's just a you know center block
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
cell with a with you know a door that
 
05:21:18.750 --> 05:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
happens to be made out of bars but it's
 
05:21:20.590 --> 05:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
much more complicated than that to to
 
05:21:24.990 --> 05:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
some extent do you have um um housing
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
requirements housing issues where where
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
the person though incarcerated unable to
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
to leave for a for the day is not in a
 
05:21:37.948 --> 05:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
setting that looks stereotypically
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
prison like because of the healthcare
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
issues it's more hospital is well it's
 
05:21:45.628 --> 05:21:45.638 align:start position:0%
fair to say even our infirmary at the
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state prison for men needs
 
05:21:50.830 --> 05:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
to be updated so it it looks like a room
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
where we put four hospital beds it's got
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
seethrough windows so we can see what's
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
happening but we need more um I'll call
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
it central uh service space to the point
 
05:22:02.990 --> 05:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
of your question deal with those health
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
conditions right now it is a renovated
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
space that is a a large uh rectangular
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
angular space that used to be a Cell
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
Block that was converted to a health
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
services space so to be mindful and as a
 
05:22:16.830 --> 05:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
good example the Hampshire correctional
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
facility for women we designed that with
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation in mind and when I talked
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
about the recidivism rate the recidivism
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
rate for women is decreasing faster than
 
05:22:28.708 --> 05:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
the recidivism rate for men we moved
 
05:22:31.070 --> 05:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
into the nire correctional facility for
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
women in 2018 their recidivism rate is
 
05:22:37.830 --> 05:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
looking from what used to be a high 40
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh 46% to closer to 30% so the
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure matters in addition to
 
05:22:45.868 --> 05:22:45.878 align:start position:0%
all the other things I've said when you
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
look specifically at men you have to
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
look at how the infrastructure is
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
impacting the delivery of Rehabilitation
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time well that's interesting
 
05:22:55.830 --> 05:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't I thought you'd find that
 
05:22:58.548 --> 05:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
interesting yeah and and you seem to
 
05:23:01.708 --> 05:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
incarcerate many many many many more men
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
than you do women sir I don't
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
incarcerate anyone the judicial system
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
does I accept them based on the
 
05:23:09.590 --> 05:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
sentencing order sir
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
welome just pointing that out it just
 
05:23:14.190 --> 05:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
seems unfortunate I don't maybe that
 
05:23:16.030 --> 05:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
says something about men well you're
 
05:23:18.030 --> 05:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
more statistically likely to be iners
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
than I am then based on that statistic
 
05:23:22.750 --> 05:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah well let's not go too far
 
05:23:26.030 --> 05:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
from this I just wanted to say something
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
Sil any other
 
05:23:30.190 --> 05:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:39.270 --> 05:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
time and next up in uh ending today's
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
session is going to be uh Department of
 
05:23:41.240 --> 05:23:59.410 align:start position:0%
session is going to be uh Department of
Information

05:23:59.410 --> 05:23:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.420 --> 05:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:06.270 --> 05:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
Technology good afternoon um afternoon
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
sir Dennis goule uh the commissioner of
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information Technology
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh just have three requests to go
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
through with you today uh the summaries
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
on the on the second
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
slide as usual cyber security is number
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
one um and you know I don't expect that
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
to change I each by each bium I've come
 
05:24:29.670 --> 05:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
with my first priority being cyber
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
security and that reflects the my peers
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
around the country who vote vote cyber
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
have voted uh cyber security as their
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
number one priority for over a
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
decade so moving on to slide three um so
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
high level each each uh year month day
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know the pace seems to be
 
05:24:57.590 --> 05:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
increasing but our enemies and the
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
criminals just keep you know getting
 
05:25:04.110 --> 05:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
better at defeating whatever we put in
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
to protect data but also protect
 
05:25:09.948 --> 05:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
continuity of government and that's a
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
big change that we've seen over the past
 
05:25:16.750 --> 05:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
just the past few years where um you
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
know it used to be we'd be concerned
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
with oh there was a data breach people's
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
data is out there and that's a concern
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
for the privacy of data but um now very
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
much um we're concerned with um
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
continuity of government U this the most
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
basic is you know where U you know a
 
05:25:37.868 --> 05:25:37.878 align:start position:0%
what they call a business email
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
compromise where somebody gives up their
 
05:25:41.990 --> 05:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
credentials and and actually allows
 
05:25:43.868 --> 05:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
criminals to take money which then is
 
05:25:46.350 --> 05:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
money you might have spent running the
 
05:25:49.548 --> 05:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
government um and we've seen that in in
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire and around the
 
05:25:53.628 --> 05:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
country U but but more severe is
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
ransomware which um we're seeing you
 
05:25:58.830 --> 05:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
know really put entire you know school
 
05:26:00.590 --> 05:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
systems out of business we've seen you
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
know police departments be shut down and
 
05:26:05.948 --> 05:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
running manual for months you know going
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
from complex sophisticated dis batching
 
05:26:11.788 --> 05:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
systems to paper so it's something that
 
05:26:14.670 --> 05:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
we take exceptionally
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
seriously and
 
05:26:19.548 --> 05:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
really each bium we're looking at what
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
do we think the appropriate investment
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
level is in new tools and
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
procedures so that we'll try to at least
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
stay up with this and then you'll see
 
05:26:32.590 --> 05:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
subsequent operating expense being
 
05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
layered on in the the subsequent bium so
 
05:26:38.948 --> 05:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
little by little actually the amount
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
we're spending on cyber security is
 
05:26:44.510 --> 05:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
creeping up on bial on a banial
 
05:26:48.510 --> 05:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
basis um so the one of the things where
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
we've noticed and we're having to spend
 
05:26:52.110 --> 05:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
more time on and and you'll see that
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
reflected in the first paragraph is the
 
05:26:59.470 --> 05:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know we connect up to um other law
 
05:27:01.390 --> 05:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to share
 
05:27:04.110 --> 05:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
information we connect up with our um
 
05:27:06.670 --> 05:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
with our municipalities to do vehicle
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
registration and things like you know
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
interfaces so if something happens in
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
their environments it puts a risk to our
 
05:27:15.788 --> 05:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
environment so getting better at
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
noticing that protecting that is part of
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
what we're doing but also with the state
 
05:27:23.310 --> 05:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
and local cyber grant program monies
 
05:27:25.708 --> 05:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
that's Federal monies that was that were
 
05:27:28.350 --> 05:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
um appropriated under the infrastructure
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill um we're investing in those
 
05:27:33.310 --> 05:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
communities to improve their cyber
 
05:27:36.350 --> 05:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
posture as well so kind of hitting it
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
from both sides this money is not
 
05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
being asked for to do anything in
 
05:27:43.270 --> 05:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities the state and local cyber
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
grant program monies which we're in year
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
two now we've gotten through the the
 
05:27:49.390 --> 05:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
accept and expend process for for year
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
two of that money I think the total is a
 
05:27:54.150 --> 05:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
little over 14 million over four years
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping that that the the
 
05:27:59.590 --> 05:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
federal government will will reup that
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
Grant when when the time comes when
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're approaching the end of it
 
05:28:07.750 --> 05:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
um so really um without going into the G
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
this is pretty geeked out stuff I Tred
 
05:28:12.990 --> 05:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
to give you a high level um explanation
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
of what we're trying to do and I'll stop
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
and take questions on cyber security
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:22.590 --> 05:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
on Dennis this is more of a general
 
05:28:24.750 --> 05:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
question but um previous Capital budgets
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
how much has have you received in the
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
last let's say maybe two I&amp;M or do you
 
05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
have any sense I want to say it's around
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a little under $4 million
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
over the last two Bay year yeah
 
05:28:40.990 --> 05:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay thanks and
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
we we we're consistently spending it
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:56.670 --> 05:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
say Okay moving on um it service
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
management that's a um as a concept it
 
05:29:04.510 --> 05:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
service management or itm uh because we
 
05:29:08.230 --> 05:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
love acronyms in state government um is
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
really uh the
 
05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
maturation of how we Define and deliver
 
05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
service IT
 
05:29:18.030 --> 05:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
services um you know there are areas
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire is ahead of other
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
states and we and and this isn't one of
 
05:29:28.110 --> 05:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
them uh so we're we've been using old
 
05:29:30.270 --> 05:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
you know old tools and
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
processes um and partly because it's
 
05:29:36.868 --> 05:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
kind of expensive to to get from where
 
05:29:38.670 --> 05:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
we are to where we think we should be in
 
05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
terms of that maturity level um Last by
 
05:29:43.868 --> 05:29:43.878 align:start position:0%
anym we said all right well let's start
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
and do phase one which is was really
 
05:29:49.548 --> 05:29:49.558 align:start position:0%
around the you know defining what it is
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
looking at our existing processes things
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
like that and we're we're in we're well
 
05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
um down the path of doing that right now
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
this request would then continue the
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
effort by beginning to layer in those
 
05:30:04.510 --> 05:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
tools um and and
 
05:30:07.150 --> 05:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh and I would think that there'd be a
 
05:30:08.910 --> 05:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
phase three so we're trying to break it
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
down so that it's not you know hugely
 
05:30:14.190 --> 05:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
impactful in anyone by any of but also
 
05:30:17.110 --> 05:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to do so because changing
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
you know the significant change that
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
we'd have to implement to how we do
 
05:30:24.030 --> 05:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
business both for ourselves as well as
 
05:30:25.628 --> 05:30:25.638 align:start position:0%
how we interact with all our agency
 
05:30:28.030 --> 05:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
partners is pretty it's a pretty large
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
task so you can't get it done in a one
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
by anym
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
anyway so um stop there Dennis can you
 
05:30:37.510 --> 05:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
give us an example of like a like a
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
specific thing that either you did or
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
about to do like this isn't us system
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
it's a series of projects it's actually
 
05:30:49.948 --> 05:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
not the system's kind of the it's
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
necessary but not sufficient it's not
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's not that in other words the biggest
 
05:30:56.788 --> 05:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
thing is the business processes that we
 
05:30:59.990 --> 05:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
use to to deliver services and and I'll
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
give you a I'll give you an example that
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
if you're doing if you interact with us
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
on if there's any like agency Finance
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
people they they would get this I know
 
05:31:11.868 --> 05:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
James and I have talked about this
 
05:31:14.350 --> 05:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
before where you know I don't understand
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
that doit budget because it's you know
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's you just for a PC there might be 20
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
line items for the cost of a single PC
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of overly complicated
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
and not really reflective of what we do
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
should we be billing you so just on the
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
billing side we probably should be say
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
all right well here's the fully loaded
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
cost of a PC and here's what it is and
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
and hide all that complexity from the
 
05:31:41.070 --> 05:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
Finance people inside the um inside the
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
um agency so that's an example of a a
 
05:31:46.590 --> 05:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
matured it service management process
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's a really simple one uh but but
 
05:31:52.750 --> 05:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an example of that so to
 
05:31:54.628 --> 05:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
do that you need systems because you
 
05:31:56.190 --> 05:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
actually need to be able to build up
 
05:31:58.830 --> 05:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
these bills of materials that are um you
 
05:32:01.470 --> 05:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
know what's the fully loaded cost of a
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know some states do this they a
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
network Port like you have a network
 
05:32:08.350 --> 05:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
Port that you might plug your PC in
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that that is um required to get on
 
05:32:17.190 --> 05:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
the network if that actually has so much
 
05:32:19.390 --> 05:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure behind it but what we're
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
doing is we're we're managing those as
 
05:32:24.670 --> 05:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
discret elements versus a you know a
 
05:32:24.680 --> 05:32:25.788 align:start position:0%
discret elements versus a you know a
holistic

05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
holistic
 
05:32:29.628 --> 05:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
service um and costing them as well
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
so so that's I and U you know we have a
 
05:32:35.948 --> 05:32:35.958 align:start position:0%
we have a contractor expert we brought
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
on to help us with this and if you're
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
interested Charlie I can set up a
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
meeting you you'd find it pretty
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
interesting I can go through this in
 
05:32:43.878 --> 05:32:48.390 align:start position:0%
interesting I can go through this in
excuting

05:32:48.390 --> 05:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
technical other questions on
 
05:33:03.628 --> 05:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
this all right so the last one is is
 
05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
what the heck is this Cloud thing Cloud
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
Solutions and services so it's
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
interesting but um the so we have a data
 
05:33:17.470 --> 05:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
center at 27 hay it's pretty old and um
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
we haven't really uh we haven't really
 
05:33:24.190 --> 05:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
asked for much money for it because we
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
haven't put a system in there a new
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
system in there since the revenue system
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
Rim system that was purchased I think
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's been it was that contract was done
 
05:33:38.110 --> 05:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
about 5 years ago and um they've been
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
running the system now for I think three
 
05:33:43.270 --> 05:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
years right it took a couple years to
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
get it running so think about that in
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
the old days every new system boom you'd
 
05:33:49.548 --> 05:33:49.558 align:start position:0%
be putting new gear in the data center
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
you'd be expanding the
 
05:33:54.628 --> 05:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
footprint everything that uh agencies
 
05:33:58.030 --> 05:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
are acquiring now is all as a service so
 
05:34:00.990 --> 05:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
Sher your question about the Medicaid
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
stuff I mean the vast majority of all
 
05:34:05.430 --> 05:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
that will end up you know I'm certain
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
being in the cloud um although we you
 
05:34:10.430 --> 05:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
know HHS we we do actually have a
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
strategic conversations about how we're
 
05:34:13.948 --> 05:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
going to do things with them because
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're our obviously our biggest
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
customer but but what what that's caused
 
05:34:19.868 --> 05:34:19.878 align:start position:0%
is you know in the days of data center
 
05:34:21.310 --> 05:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
we had to learn how to do things like
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
backing up and you know um making copies
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
of data and doing Disaster Recovery
 
05:34:29.948 --> 05:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
playing and all that so this these Cloud
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
Solutions and services are really the
 
05:34:33.590 --> 05:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
layered services that we're we're
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
finding that we have to add to to kind
 
05:34:38.910 --> 05:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
of manage this new infrastructure that
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
we live in today um liquor just went
 
05:34:46.190 --> 05:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
live with a new system for their um
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
Finance inventory and retailing their
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
stores business to B Toc business to
 
05:34:54.430 --> 05:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
customer and B and B Tob businessto
 
05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
business transactions all of that is in
 
05:35:00.270 --> 05:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
the cloud except for the you know if you
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
go into a liquor store you'll see
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
equipment there but other than that all
 
05:35:06.030 --> 05:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
of that's in the cloud and that's a
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
pretty huge system op operating in the
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
cloud and and so what we've learned
 
05:35:12.590 --> 05:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
there or what we are learning and
 
05:35:14.470 --> 05:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's learning all the states and
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the businesses and the private
 
05:35:17.948 --> 05:35:17.958 align:start position:0%
sector is that it's a it's a different
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
set of skills inside your the people
 
05:35:22.030 --> 05:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
that are running it it's a it's a
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
different set of tools that you need to
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
manage overall and provide productivity
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
and governance
 
05:35:31.310 --> 05:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
because one of the mistakes we have New
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wasn't a what they call a
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
cloud first state there's kind of
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
terminology Cloud first Cloud smart
 
05:35:39.990 --> 05:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
Cloud first was yeah go to Cloud no
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
matter what and we're like well why
 
05:35:43.510 --> 05:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
right and I was thinking why and then
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
the the folks who were a little slower
 
05:35:48.510 --> 05:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
and more ponderous like us or I call it
 
05:35:50.110 --> 05:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
Cloud smart because we were thinking
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
about well do it when it needs to be
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
done not when it um when it um you know
 
05:35:59.548 --> 05:35:59.558 align:start position:0%
when you just because cloud is there and
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of how we've been
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
approaching it you know
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
opportunistically when a system is being
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
replaced um if Hardware is aging out for
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
example um you know the employment
 
05:36:12.788 --> 05:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
security is has a really you know a very
 
05:36:16.590 --> 05:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
good unemployment system Unemployment uh
 
05:36:18.868 --> 05:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
Insurance system one of the very few in
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
the country that that was able to scale
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
to the to the needs of covid but their
 
05:36:26.030 --> 05:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hardware is aging so do you buy new
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
hardware and plunk it in a data center
 
05:36:30.150 --> 05:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
or do you do you host it in the cloud
 
05:36:32.990 --> 05:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
and it's likely that you know George and
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
Rich will decide to host in the cloud so
 
05:36:38.270 --> 05:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's an example those
 
05:36:40.110 --> 05:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
as we do more and more of that we're
 
05:36:43.548 --> 05:36:43.558 align:start position:0%
learning the skills and and and kind of
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
supporting services and capabilities
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we'll need to make sure that is is
 
05:36:52.270 --> 05:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
as secure and as um available and as
 
05:36:54.868 --> 05:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
well governed at least as what we were
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
doing in our own Data Center and that's
 
05:36:59.510 --> 05:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the essence of this investment
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we we actually had a similar
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation that we asked for I
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
believe to by any ago that's we we're
 
05:37:08.670 --> 05:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
well into to invest that those
 
05:37:10.350 --> 05:37:10.360 align:start position:0%
Investments and we believe we'll
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
continue be be needing to continue to do
 
05:37:14.638 --> 05:37:18.230 align:start position:0%
continue be be needing to continue to do
that

05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
so um I'm curious about this right
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
because on some level you know I think
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
the 27 part of haen Drive was was built
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
as Central data processing right I think
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
that when that was a term um um and I
 
05:37:35.470 --> 05:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
think Su Luba worked there went from the
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
start so our our favorite do
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
employee um other than you other than me
 
05:37:43.750 --> 05:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
is Su Lu good to know yeah um although
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'll tell Sue that she's my favorite not
 
05:37:49.390 --> 05:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
you just so you know don't you
 
05:37:52.510 --> 05:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
um we it you know we you think of it as
 
05:37:54.670 --> 05:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
as a place where all of the states data
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
is and I
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
remember six or eight years ago somebody
 
05:38:01.510 --> 05:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
talking about how oh yeah data's at at
 
05:38:03.628 --> 05:38:03.638 align:start position:0%
you know 27 Hazen I think that's not a
 
05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
secret and then there's a backup site on
 
05:38:08.310 --> 05:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
the other side of the river at
 
05:38:09.750 --> 05:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
Toby or somewhere I don't even know
 
05:38:12.110 --> 05:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
where and and I thought oh great so if
 
05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the electric all goes down for all of
 
05:38:18.470 --> 05:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
conquered we're screwed um the but we're
 
05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
evolving from a world where it matters
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
where your data is and I'm paying for
 
05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
servers for New Hampshire first right
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a guy somewhere in
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
the bowels of your building who's like
 
05:38:31.788 --> 05:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
going you know like Lily Tomlin with the
 
05:38:35.468 --> 05:38:35.478 align:start position:0%
uh with the uh operator phone but we're
 
05:38:37.270 --> 05:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
moving to a place where our data won't
 
05:38:40.910 --> 05:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
be be here it'll all be out there
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere which sounds both
 
05:38:46.310 --> 05:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
safer right cuz there's multiple places
 
05:38:48.548 --> 05:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
the data exists it doesn't just you know
 
05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
if the if the if a light if lightning
 
05:38:53.628 --> 05:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
strikes 27 Hazen we're not out of luck
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's buried in a mountain in New
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
York or somewhere but it's also a little
 
05:38:57.958 --> 05:39:00.270 align:start position:0%
York or somewhere but it's also a little
bit

05:39:00.270 --> 05:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
bit
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
um uh vulnerable cuz it's not here we
 
05:39:06.910 --> 05:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy we don't have a I
 
05:39:10.190 --> 05:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a sheet why why should I be
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
why should I be happy and is there a
 
05:39:13.708 --> 05:39:13.718 align:start position:0%
balance between those two things or is
 
05:39:15.510 --> 05:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
the cloud just where we're going and I'm
 
05:39:17.430 --> 05:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
not not some sort of weird Battle Star
 
05:39:20.830 --> 05:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
Galactica thing where blow us it's a
 
05:39:22.510 --> 05:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good example that you brought up
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
because that's part of what we're
 
05:39:26.110 --> 05:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
investing in here is these you know
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's the um that extra copy you
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
say Okay um you know I know for example
 
05:39:34.590 --> 05:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
a liquor is you know they're running
 
05:39:36.750 --> 05:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
their finance and and point of sale on
 
05:39:39.788 --> 05:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
Microsoft 365 they have an automatic
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
copy that you know if if the main their
 
05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
main data center would to go down
 
05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
there's another one that for their
 
05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
production system that Microsoft has
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
running at all all times so that's nice
 
05:39:53.150 --> 05:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
but you know we look at um you know do
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
we want another copy of that and in the
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
case of liquor they're going to have a
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
copy that is for reporting for example
 
05:40:02.110 --> 05:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
much like you know for first we have the
 
05:40:05.070 --> 05:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
data Lake uh um that I'm sure Alex has
 
05:40:08.350 --> 05:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
talked to you about and and similarly
 
05:40:11.548 --> 05:40:11.558 align:start position:0%
with liquor similarly with um DHHS with
 
05:40:13.270 --> 05:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
their ebi electronic business
 
05:40:14.990 --> 05:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence that we talked a little bit
 
05:40:18.270 --> 05:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
about earlier so so yeah that's you you
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
have the the mistake that a lot of folks
 
05:40:22.628 --> 05:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
made particularly the cloud first is
 
05:40:24.910 --> 05:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
they said oh it's in the cloud I don't
 
05:40:27.430 --> 05:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
need to worry about anything that's
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's not correct you need to worry
 
05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
about the same things in different ways
 
05:40:33.628 --> 05:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure you have access to
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
your data like I I'll just share a
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
consideration we were talking to to Rich
 
05:40:40.670 --> 05:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
labors at Employment Security about is
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay as we move we could actually put it
 
05:40:47.150 --> 05:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
in a different database and save money
 
05:40:49.830 --> 05:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know instead of giving a huge huge
 
05:40:52.030 --> 05:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
amounts of money to Oracle for the
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
database we give less huge amounts to
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
AWS for their native database all right
 
05:41:00.468 --> 05:41:00.478 align:start position:0%
but what does that mean in terms of my
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
ability to get it back when I want it
 
05:41:04.150 --> 05:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
does that actually constrain me at all
 
05:41:07.868 --> 05:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
or is it just as easy um but the but
 
05:41:10.830 --> 05:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
essentially you know if I'm running uh
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
as far as accessibility of data the the
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
tools and the systems that they're
 
05:41:19.750 --> 05:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
running on in the cloud are the same
 
05:41:22.548 --> 05:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
ones I'm essentially the same as I'm
 
05:41:24.510 --> 05:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
running on here so you can do the
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
querying of data the access of data the
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
backing up of data all of that stuff you
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
know it can be done there's no um uh
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
there's there's been some legal battles
 
05:41:37.788 --> 05:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
around you know Kenya Kenya cloud
 
05:41:40.670 --> 05:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
provider hold your data hostage uh no
 
05:41:41.948 --> 05:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
and you got to make sure that they can't
 
05:41:44.990 --> 05:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
in contracts right but but no I mean
 
05:41:47.708 --> 05:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
it's your data it's not theirs unless
 
05:41:50.430 --> 05:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
you make a mistake in in you know in an
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
agreement and allow them to have that
 
05:41:55.390 --> 05:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
but our Agreements are typically pretty
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
clear about you know ownership of the
 
05:42:01.510 --> 05:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
data as well as any special intellectual
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
property that we develop that we invest
 
05:42:06.030 --> 05:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
in and develop for ourselves so like
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
back in the day I could I had an
 
05:42:10.030 --> 05:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
external Zip drive mhm am I dating
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
myself um the uh cuz I could get like
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
five six eight Meg of data on one extra
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
thick three and 1 half inch floppy and
 
05:42:21.868 --> 05:42:21.878 align:start position:0%
uh but it was mine I did that I put it
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
on this disc I did it twice right
 
05:42:26.230 --> 05:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to make sure my hard
 
05:42:27.628 --> 05:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
drive that I wasn't just relying on
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
Windows 98 to back up my hard drive for
 
05:42:32.110 --> 05:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
me that I was but I had it but it was
 
05:42:34.350 --> 05:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
mine and whatever happened unless
 
05:42:35.670 --> 05:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
somebody came too close to me with a
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
magnet it was mine
 
05:42:41.468 --> 05:42:41.478 align:start position:0%
and um I I I hear you saying that we we
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't really have those issues with the
 
05:42:45.788 --> 05:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
cloud at any point are there
 
05:42:47.910 --> 05:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
Financial hostage taking I'm going to
 
05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
use one of my so I I'm not an enormous
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
fan of the the Washington Corporation
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
Called Microsoft um that um you used to
 
05:42:59.948 --> 05:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
used to buy a piece of software and you
 
05:43:00.990 --> 05:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
could keep it as long as you were
 
05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
willing to go with it for a while and
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
now they came up with a new scheme where
 
05:43:06.830 --> 05:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
they make you pay money every year to
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
keep it up and and you reached the point
 
05:43:10.910 --> 05:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
where you're sort of Hostage CU you
 
05:43:13.670 --> 05:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
can't switch right you you there are
 
05:43:15.468 --> 05:43:15.478 align:start position:0%
certain softwares where at some point
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're like oh my God I don't think I
 
05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
can ever get out of this and I'm sort of
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
stuck like I can't what would it cost to
 
05:43:23.150 --> 05:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
repr procure a
 
05:43:28.510 --> 05:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
new MMI system Erp pick something and
 
05:43:32.830 --> 05:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
when we go Cloud clish on everything is
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
is there any of that is that a concern
 
05:43:36.190 --> 05:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
at all or is it is that sort of
 
05:43:36.200 --> 05:43:37.708 align:start position:0%
at all or is it is that sort of
overblown

05:43:37.708 --> 05:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
overblown
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
well there's a couple things one one is
 
05:43:43.070 --> 05:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
that the biggest part of switching isn't
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
actually the technology it's the effort
 
05:43:46.628 --> 05:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
you have to go through like even you
 
05:43:48.190 --> 05:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
know like to like like we're doing now
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
with your Erp system it's still a lot of
 
05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
work um yes but that and that would be
 
05:43:57.070 --> 05:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
the same work whether we were doing it
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
inside my own data center at 27 Hazen or
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'm doing it inside somebody else's it's
 
05:44:07.468 --> 05:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
the same work um they the consolidate in
 
05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
the industry is to me is the
 
05:44:13.628 --> 05:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
biggest um you know consolidation and
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
dirty tricks inside the industry which
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
have always been there they're just
 
05:44:19.708 --> 05:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
different now in in the cloud for
 
05:44:22.310 --> 05:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
example um you can in fact there was a
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
sen Senate Bill
 
05:44:29.390 --> 05:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
210 um I think was passed by both bodies
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
um which really it's called the the um
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
it was sponsored by it was pushed by the
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
coalition for fair software
 
05:44:42.510 --> 05:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
licensing um says you know they object
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
to the fact that um some software
 
05:44:46.430 --> 05:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
companies will charge a different amount
 
05:44:49.150 --> 05:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
subscription cost for if it's hosted in
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
their own environment versus somebody
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
else's so for example if you have an
 
05:44:54.150 --> 05:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
Oracle database and you want to host it
 
05:44:56.468 --> 05:44:56.478 align:start position:0%
in AWS or
 
05:44:58.868 --> 05:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
Google um Oracle will charge you more
 
05:45:00.468 --> 05:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
than if you host it in their own Data
 
05:45:02.670 --> 05:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
Center and so some people think that's
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
unfair some people think that's um you
 
05:45:07.868 --> 05:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
know a business being smart and and
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
leveraging the competitive advantage of
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
their investments in vertical
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
integration so um but you know moving
 
05:45:19.590 --> 05:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
out of Microsoft uh seven states have
 
05:45:23.590 --> 05:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
done it and moved all over to Google a
 
05:45:26.830 --> 05:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
lot of work systems aren't quite as good
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
but you can do it but those are the only
 
05:45:30.030 --> 05:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
two in the world right so you say if you
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
don't like mic of Google where you going
 
05:45:35.190 --> 05:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
to go we're not doing open software or
 
05:45:37.310 --> 05:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
whatever that build like 10 years ago
 
05:45:39.190 --> 05:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
for we're all supposed to use open
 
05:45:41.270 --> 05:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
Office yeah there's a l there were two
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
two uh two sessions in a row there were
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
a number of Open Source bills so the
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
open source folks would say there's
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
another option I don't share that
 
05:45:52.390 --> 05:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
feeling for you know for email and
 
05:45:53.830 --> 05:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration and things like that I
 
05:45:56.310 --> 05:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
don't think related to ask number one
 
05:45:56.320 --> 05:45:58.230 align:start position:0%
don't think related to ask number one
cyber

05:45:58.230 --> 05:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
cyber
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
security yeah shut up now so I'm you
 
05:46:03.948 --> 05:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
know and and and Charlie the the subs
 
05:46:07.628 --> 05:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
two more things um it it how we feel
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
about cloud and you know there's pluses
 
05:46:09.760 --> 05:46:10.468 align:start position:0%
about cloud and you know there's pluses
and

05:46:10.468 --> 05:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
minuses um everybody's moving to it
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
there in many cases there's you you you
 
05:46:19.270 --> 05:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
can't buy a product that isn't in the
 
05:46:22.590 --> 05:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
cloud in fact even know the revenue that
 
05:46:24.708 --> 05:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
system fast systems who has our Revenue
 
05:46:27.830 --> 05:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
in in 27 Hazen the last system that was
 
05:46:30.350 --> 05:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
placed in there their new their new
 
05:46:32.910 --> 05:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
installations are all being done in a
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
cloud environment um and the there's
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
almost no what you call Perpetual
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
license agreements anymore that was the
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
you buy at once and pay for maintenance
 
05:46:46.030 --> 05:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
ver now it's all subscription
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's done that because I mean
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
certain companies pioneered
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
it um and they did it for consistency
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
right because you ended up with this you
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
know technology companies have these
 
05:47:01.510 --> 05:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
massively bumpy Revenue curves made them
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
unpredictable made the you know Wall
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
Street didn't love it so they adapted
 
05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
and now we're on the hook for
 
05:47:12.270 --> 05:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
subscriptions versus you know these
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
Capital intensive projects that then you
 
05:47:16.628 --> 05:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
pay maintenance on over many
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
years so it's that that those days are
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
gone regardless of whether we like it or
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
not I just had you just reminded me on
 
05:47:26.788 --> 05:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
the rims so rims is on
 
05:47:29.670 --> 05:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
Prem would your project I say your
 
05:47:31.990 --> 05:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
project but the the Cyber um not
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
security the cloud that you just talked
 
05:47:37.868 --> 05:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
about um would that would you be able to
 
05:47:39.868 --> 05:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
convert like a rims that's currently on
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
premise to a cloud or would a
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
rims software or fast you know have to
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
do something like that like is that
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
something like that we could do I think
 
05:47:51.990 --> 05:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's yes to both right because we would
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
we would work with the Department of
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue to make sure that whatever we
 
05:47:58.190 --> 05:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
thought were best practices were
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
included in whatever agreement they
 
05:48:04.310 --> 05:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
develop to move to their you know their
 
05:48:07.468 --> 05:48:07.478 align:start position:0%
ongoing solution in the cloud and then
 
05:48:09.190 --> 05:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the vendor would be engaged to
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
do a lot of the
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
work has there been any discussions yet
 
05:48:15.390 --> 05:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
about um any moving to the cloud with I
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
me I feel like room was just started and
 
05:48:18.510 --> 05:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's part of believe that it could be
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
three to five years ago but is that
 
05:48:22.430 --> 05:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
something um well you know I always ask
 
05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
this question and you may have heard me
 
05:48:25.868 --> 05:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
asking in for over the years when we
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
were talking about to them um I'd always
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
say you know what's your what's your
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
stance on your on-prem versions are you
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
still upgra updating them you you know
 
05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
finally after many years infor said well
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
we're really not investing in our arm
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
Prem Solutions anymore it's only Cloud
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
Suite we're investing in and that tells
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
you oh I better make plans to get there
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to keep using this system
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
and fast just recently did the same
 
05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
thing so we're not feeling pressure to
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
do anything I don't think but when they
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
fess up and say oh yeah you know our
 
05:49:03.830 --> 05:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
direction is to go this way then you
 
05:49:06.430 --> 05:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
kind of know you know where you're going
 
05:49:08.190 --> 05:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
to end end up if you stay with that
 
05:49:10.590 --> 05:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
solution and the fast solution I think
 
05:49:12.548 --> 05:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
you know the revenue folks would say has
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
been a huge success for
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
them I have one final question which is
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
um this notion as as everyone you know
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
the state has a
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
longterm you know as we as we buy a
 
05:49:28.190 --> 05:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
service we buy software as a service and
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
and we move into that there's a there's
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
a thing where I'm you know I'm
 
05:49:33.150 --> 05:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
committing to you know 10 years let's
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
say a million dollars a year or 5 years
 
05:49:39.548 --> 05:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
at 200 Grand a year whatever it is um
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
before I do that so and and the
 
05:49:43.990 --> 05:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
accountants are catching up with this
 
05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
right the gby whatever the hell it was
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
this year um has the software of service
 
05:49:49.910 --> 05:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we now have to report on
 
05:49:52.750 --> 05:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
separately um if I do that if I'm an
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
agency and I'm buying a making a
 
05:49:57.590 --> 05:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
long-term software commitment that that
 
05:50:00.468 --> 05:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
isn't I'm not just buying Windows 98 I'm
 
05:50:02.910 --> 05:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
I'm signing on for eight years do I need
 
05:50:02.920 --> 05:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
I'm signing on for eight years do I need
your

05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
approval and so centrally Duit knows the
 
05:50:08.160 --> 05:50:09.628 align:start position:0%
approval and so centrally Duit knows the
state's

05:50:09.628 --> 05:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
state's
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
exposure yeah I mean I know it's not
 
05:50:13.990 --> 05:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
perfect because we're in early stages
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know all the
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
contracts come through me or supposed to
 
05:50:19.948 --> 05:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
occasionally agency you know
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
occasionally we'll see something I'll
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
get it you know I get a write up from my
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
from my team before each governor and
 
05:50:29.230 --> 05:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
council meeting and well this one never
 
05:50:30.788 --> 05:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
every once in a while there's a little
 
05:50:32.910 --> 05:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
this one never came before doit but
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
here's what it is and so I get a write
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
up of all of my ours the ones we bring
 
05:50:38.910 --> 05:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
forward plus all the ones the agencies
 
05:50:41.350 --> 05:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
are bringing forward and how it sits how
 
05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of due diligence we've done on
 
05:50:46.030 --> 05:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
it and how we feel about it but I I
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
approve all of those before they before
 
05:50:53.070 --> 05:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
they come and sometimes you know some uh
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
it gets to me kind of late
 
05:50:57.868 --> 05:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
so um you know when I first started in
 
05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
2015 I was like I had to do a lot of
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
research before I approved anything
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know what stuff was now
 
05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
I kind of been around a while and I know
 
05:51:07.750 --> 05:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
what's going when in the agencies I know
 
05:51:10.830 --> 05:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
what the projects are I kind of cons
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
sense um you know right away whether I
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
would approve something or not and
 
05:51:17.310 --> 05:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
typically what I'll do is early before
 
05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
it comes to me if I'm if I have issues
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
with a project I will say gee you know
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to people about it and say you
 
05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
know let's how about changing this and
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
if there's push back I
 
05:51:31.030 --> 05:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
will sometimes say GE you know I don't
 
05:51:32.868 --> 05:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
know if I can approve this when it comes
 
05:51:35.150 --> 05:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
to me if we don't do something different
 
05:51:36.868 --> 05:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
here particularly and what are things
 
05:51:39.910 --> 05:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
that get me going cyber security data
 
05:51:43.708 --> 05:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
privacy stuff um you know long-term
 
05:51:46.030 --> 05:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
stability thoughts you know like I had
 
05:51:49.628 --> 05:51:49.638 align:start position:0%
one was a while back that was like yeah
 
05:51:51.628 --> 05:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
well we want to save money by putting it
 
05:51:56.270 --> 05:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
on a server in our office very sens very
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
sensitive data and I'm like uh no we're
 
05:52:01.708 --> 05:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
not going to do that yeah yes it is more
 
05:52:05.110 --> 05:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
expensive to put a a server in my in the
 
05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
data center our data center Center in 27
 
05:52:10.750 --> 05:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hazen and back it up and have physical
 
05:52:12.830 --> 05:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
protections and have all the compliance
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
stuff that we do yeah that's more
 
05:52:17.230 --> 05:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
expensive but that's what we have to do
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
as a state particularly for some of just
 
05:52:22.750 --> 05:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
really sensitive data so so it's you
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
know that that's those are the kind of
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
discussions but honestly we don't have
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
too much trouble with that it's I think
 
05:52:30.270 --> 05:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
has maybe the most uh the highest level
 
05:52:36.830 --> 05:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration between it and the
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
agencies that I've
 
05:52:41.548 --> 05:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
observed um you know you know spending
 
05:52:43.468 --> 05:52:43.478 align:start position:0%
time nine years with my peers around the
 
05:52:47.590 --> 05:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
country I I feel good about being here
 
05:52:49.230 --> 05:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
on a lot of days when I hear some of the
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.230 --> 05:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere any other
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much all right
 
05:53:00.990 --> 05:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that being the uh last
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
presentation of the afternoon we are now
 
05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh recessed until tomorrow morning at
