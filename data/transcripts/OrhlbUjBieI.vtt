00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone the time being
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
sessions okay first up I'm going to open
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
the work session on cacr
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
18 represent of
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
PL I'm not in favor of this at all
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
there's a long history of churches uh
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
receiving tax deductions uh uh since the
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
country's been founded essentially and
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh they do a lot of good uh for whatever
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
the denomination they do tremendous
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
amount of good uh in social welfare
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
helping people taking care of the poor
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
the Indigent U and uh uh providing the
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
help where it's needed and if this were
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
to pass a lot of churches would have to
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
close and so it it it were we're the
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
least Church station in the nation now
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
and it's going to get worse than that
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh some people say well the
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
separation of church and State there's
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
never been separation of church and
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
state there's a there's a a constitution
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution it says the
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
government shall not interfere with
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
churches that doesn't mean churches
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
can't Thrive and so the government
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
should be helpful even-handedly helpful
 
00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
thank you okay anybody else yes
 
00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
thank you okay anybody else yes
representative

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
fellows so the way that I look at this
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I think that um it doesn't need to
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
be a constitutional amendment uh at some
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
point we might want to look at tax
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
exempt Charities taxes you know
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
Charities that are exempt from property
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
tax but we should do it as a as a whole
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
look at the at the whole thing and not
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
just specifically look at
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:57.949 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:24.949 align:start position:0%
 
my

00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
ex

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't thank you representative
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
Southworth I do see your microphone this
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
time great thank you Mr chair um would
 
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
you Contin consider doing straw Poes on
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
some of these it might be a quick way to
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
sure yes represent ORS yes my concern
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be the burden that would put on
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
the public system somebody would have to
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
step up and feed people clothe people
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
house people temporarily so these
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
churches are doing uh the public a
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
service our communities a service and I
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
think it would put an undue burden if we
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
tax these
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
churches it would put a burden on the
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
public to meet the need because a lot of
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
these churches as we know operate on a
 
00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:35.590 align:start position:0%
these churches as we know operate on a
Sho

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
Sho
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
string and uh I I think we would drive
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
them right out of out of business thank
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
you I guess I I can confirm that uh my
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
own church being a small Church um would
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
be deeply hurt by this and um many other
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
Church small churches yeah they're just
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
barely surviving and this would probably
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
be the death now for them um not to
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
mention you know larger churches do do a
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
lot of community outreach and and help
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
from what I've seen and um it's just
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to pick up the
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
slack um so it's it's it's not really
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
solving anything in my opinion
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
either um I guess to representative
 
00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:18.749 align:start position:0%
either um I guess to representative
southworth's

00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
southworth's
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
um point we could take a quick straw
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
poll um how many is there anybody for
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
this um
cacr

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none I have assume everyone
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
sitting here is is against it um is
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
there anything else anyone would like to
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
cacr okay
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
see yes yeah I think the proper motion
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
when we get to it is an itl not not an
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
interim study or anything else an itl
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay um with that I'm going to close the
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
work session on cacr
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.069 align:start position:0%
work session on cacr
18

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
we'll now open the work session on HB
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
1191 I'll be forward again represent
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
plat to me this is has Merit it would uh
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
remove the rooms and meals tax for
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
participants in the restaurant Voucher
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
Program which is part of Meals on Wheels
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
and that that program gives senior
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
citizens some social uh uh exposure they
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise might be C up and not have and
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a wash because instead of charging
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
$13 for a meal to include the tax it
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
charge $12 a meal but on the other hand
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
they turn that the that program turns
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
around and builds the state and they'll
 
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
build the state for $12 rather than $13
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not not costing the government
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
any to the state of New Hampshire any to
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
pass this and it it was just eliminates
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
you uh represent General ery uh thank
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh the only question I have
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
on this is regarding the cost of the
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
individual businesses to modify their uh
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
computer systems most restaurants have
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
computer systems now uh to to do this
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
and and I I I'm not sure if the point of
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
sale system has it built in where they
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
can ignore the tax that's already built
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
into their system uh if we give a little
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
clarification of that because that
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
question may come up if this goes to the
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
floor so we should be prepared to answer
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
it uh anyone in the room have any
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
information about
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
that if I could ask Mr
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes you may you may come up and
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
yourself uh thank you chair and other
 
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
Brian Clark I'm general counsel for the
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau of elderly and Adult Services I

have with me maren Brown nutrition

consultant to the Bureau of elderly and
Adult

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
Services uh could you repeat the
 
00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:23.350 align:start position:0%
Services uh could you repeat the
question

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
please yeah thank you yeah the question
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
is what is the cost to the businesses to
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
implement a program that would
 
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the voucher system
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh customer and the regular
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
customer um that's going to be agency
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
dependent so right now we have just two
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
agencies out of our 10 contracted
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
agencies with our Bureau that are
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
providing this particular um the Meals
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
on Wheels
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
service um Hillsboro County did um
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
receive a grant to purchase the um EBT
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
software the debit card software that
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
they use um so they had support around
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
that getting their program off the
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
ground the actual cost I'm not sure but
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
they could report out on that Tri count
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
cap up in Coos County is the other
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
agency that's was in the pilot of this
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
program um they have not fronted up any
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
additional cost what they're doing is
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
they're using software that pre-exists
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
and they are using a paper voucher
 
00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
and they are using a paper voucher
system

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
so they're a really good representative
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
of what New Hampshire might see um a
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
larger um program that has uh more
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
ability to pursue grants and get funding
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
in a different way and could
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
pursue what you're talking about which
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
could initially cost them more money but
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
TR counted cap is an example of how at
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
least half of our programs would
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
probably go which is to utilize systems
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
already in place to make it work with
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
minimal cost follow
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
that actually wasn't responsive the
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
question is the cost to the provider to
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
restaurant so they already have to
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
differentiate between every restaurant
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
participating provides meals um to RVP
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
participants and then also are
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses so they already
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
have to differentiate between this meal
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
was provided and it meets these
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
standards that the older Americans act
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
sets out so they should already have a
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
system in
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
place and hopefully this will answer
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
your question um my understanding to
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
date with both um Hillsboro County and
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
with Tri County cap there has been no
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
additional cost burden to the restaurant
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
to get the program rolling The dietitian
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
that's required to set up a menu built
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
into their existing menu is taken on by
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit agency contracted with us
 
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
um and the whether they do an EBT or a
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
paper voucher again that cost is
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
absorbed by the
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
agency not by the
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant thank you for that answer
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh representative fellows
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Ames
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
so the way I heard the question and and
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
if I heard the question wrong then I
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
have this question I I think the issue
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
is is for the
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant they're programmed so that
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
everything that they sell the the room
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
the meals tax is applied automatically
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
to any sale that they
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
make so this
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
proposal if we were to adopt this they
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
would somehow have to not automatically
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
apply the room and meals tax to the
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
these particular meals
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
and how would they go about doing
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
that is there any piece that you want to
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
answer okay all right all right so
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully this may help when it comes to
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
there so this bill is only asking for
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
meals specifically provided under the
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant Voucher Program those meals
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
for anyone who this has not been
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
clarified for you um I allow me to do
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
that each meal includes a protein a
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
starch a vegetable a fruit water coffee
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
or tea so if you or I would to walk in
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we're part of the restaurant voucher
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
program and we go to a a participating
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
restaurant if we order the predetermined
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
menu that's been approved it would cost
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
us nothing other than a donation if we
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
did it and the tip but if you and I
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
chose to add something an appetizer a
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
dessert um a mosa that would not be
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
covered so there's an additional receipt
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
that would be be created like any other
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant and that would be covered um
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
that would be meal taxed but not the RVP
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
core meal I don't excuse me I don't
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
think that was your question was or so
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
it it was not my question but I'm glad
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
that you told us that because what I'm
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
hearing now is if somebody goes in with
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
a any a regular customer with without of
 
00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:30.390 align:start position:0%
a any a regular customer with without of
a

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
voucher goes in and they they buy a meal
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
it you know the they buy food that cost
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
$10 and when the waitress goes to print
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
the bill for them
 
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.789 align:start position:0%
the bill for them
automatically

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
85% is added to the bill but this bill
 
00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
asks that for those meals that that tax
 
00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.350 align:start position:0%
asks that for those meals that that tax
of

00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
82% not be
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
added and now I hear that people maybe
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
buying the dessert or drink on top of
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
that so their bill would have to
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
um automatically put the tax on the
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
dessert and the drink but not the meal
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
which makes it more complicated so my
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
question to the attorney is
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
how much of a burden is that going to be
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
for the restaurants to program
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
their whatever prints their bills so
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they can exclude things
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay so they already need to be able to
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
generate a receipt that a meal was
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
provided under the restaurant voucher
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
program and they certify that it meets
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
our standards our dietary standards our
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
dietary requirements so they already
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
have a system in place to generate
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
receipts for RVP and receipts for their
 
00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:06.390 align:start position:0%
receipts for RVP and receipts for their
for-profit

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.430 align:start position:0%
for-profit
business

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
so can I just say that having worked in
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants that all they're going to
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
that for that all they're going to do is
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a special instead
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
of saying hamburger it's going to
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
say um you know whatever this program is
 
00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
say um you know whatever this program is
voucher

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
voucher
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
so that that identifies that that that
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
they served that meal that does not
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
address the question we have about the
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
room and meals tax okay hopefully this
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
will continue to help as we we pair it
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
down um both of the all of the
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are currently
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
participating in this program in order
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
to be approved by our Bureau to be to
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
participate they have had to work with
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
the contracted agency's dietitian who
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
know who knows the standards of this
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
program and once that's created they
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
have a separate menu it's sort of like a
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant having um an early bird menu
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
and having a regular menu so it's built
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
into what the Food Service establishment
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
already does but instead of an early
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
bird menu they have an RVP menu so
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
there's no additional um cost or
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that as far as the
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
training component of it does that is
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
offered by all of our agencies for any
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
food service establishment that chooses
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
to join this program that they will
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
offer the training to the staff in any
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
way shape or form that they feel their
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
staff needs or what the agency has
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
identified of the restaurants that are
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
currently participating none of them
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
have reported an additional
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
cost in taking on this program
 
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.870 align:start position:0%
cost in taking on this program
representative

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
amam yeah I I think we're making a
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
mountain out of a mo mhill here
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
um is it true that uh um one of the
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for this bill is that
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
currently vouchered
 
00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:07.110 align:start position:0%
currently vouchered
meals

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
are paid for by the senior center whe
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
The Entity that uh contract with and
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
then the tax that we're talking about
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
here is that t t uh paid by the senior
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
center to the government currently that
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
is also being paid by the nonprofit
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh subcontractor with our Bureau yes all
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
of it is by if that's true clearly the
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants are differentiating between
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
the the voucher meal and the other meals
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
right exactly okay um and the other
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
question or it's really rhetorical um
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that this is an entirely
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary program from the perspective
 
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the restaurants they can choose or
 
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039 align:start position:0%
not Cho choose to do this and if uh it's
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
a nuisance to do it well they've decided
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that they they want to
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
Bear is that correct absolutely even the
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
contracts are written that if e either
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
party wants to back out because of
 
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
examples that you stated they have a a a
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
very very short reasonable window
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
whether it's on the part of the
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofit agency or the Food Service
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
establishment either one can say this
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
isn't working for me and yes it is I I
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
know I noed don't if this is being
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
recorded but yes each Food Service
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
establishment it's absolutely voluntary
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
and as of right now we have 1 2 3 we
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
have three restaurants with they're in
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
conversations with two others of those
 
00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519 align:start position:0%
two they approach the agency they heard
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
about this they are very Community
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
committed restaurants they believe in
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
providing a community support and they
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
saw this as a means to do it so they
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
actually approach the
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
agencies representative
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you so just to
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
rephrase it I think I know where we got
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
off a little bit so the 8 and a 12% tax
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
on your meals never was paid by the
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
restaurant anyway no the our nonprofit
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
agency work for them it was just being
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
paid by you that makes it much clearer
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
you representative PL two points one uh
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants I think are approaching you
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
because they get business out of it that
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
they otherwise wouldn't get it increases
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
their traffic is that
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
correct that's a good way to frame it um
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
representative PL they potentially get
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
more traffic they don't necessarily make
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
more money because it's a fixed rate for
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
that same meal if you would see it on
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
their menu maybe be tweaked a little bit
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
because it has to meet our nutrition
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
standards but that same meal they could
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
be charging 1516 $18 for but they're
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
willing to take that reduction in what
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
we give them because they're Community
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
oriented Food Service establishments
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
follow up follow just full
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
disclosure I have the one of those cards
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh but when I send in half of us in the
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
room uh at the side of the table might
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
qualify uh but but uh when I do send in
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
money did send money into the state I
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
sent the whole thing not just the four
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
bucks I I sent the full cost of the meal
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
and then some so so uh but I I so SP so
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
much time in the legislature it got
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
cancelled on me so I had to have it
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
renewed and let's see if it gets
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
renewed thank you very much in full
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
fellows we received a um letter of
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
support from Tri County and it's dated
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
January 5th and it says that they're
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
working on setting something up but they
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
hadn't done it yet so can in you're
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
saying that there that it is in place
 
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
saying that there that it is in place
now

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
no they're still in process do you want
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
the brief history on how why it was
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
written like that do you need that today
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
but I would it is in process but I would
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
like to know what the um do you know the
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
restaurants that they're talking to do
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
do the current restaurant that they're
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
in conversation with is the full send
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
Bar and Grill and that's in Pittsburgh
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
which will um for those of you who know
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
our state and its geography um
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh is almost about as far north
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
as we can possibly get in one of our
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
most rural cities or towns can you say
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
repeat that Pittsburg p i t no not
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh the name of the restaurant
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
sure full send full send yeah full send
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
Bar and Grill yeah I had to have them
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
repeat it for me several times too it's
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
an unusual name the other potential
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant this is one that they had in
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
place and much like what has already
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
been discussed it didn't work for them
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
they changed ownership so they needed to
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
pull out and now they're back in
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
conversations with Tri County but
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
nothing none of these across my desk for
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
approval so they're all still in talking
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
phase but the other potential restaurant
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
to come back on board is the Wilderness
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant in
 
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
restaurant in
colbrook

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
questions you have another question M no
 
00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
you all right um we'll take a a quick
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
straw poll in this one how many people
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh at this point this is a non-binding
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
strum yeah oh sure yeah so I get the
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
impression that the V the um the debit
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
cards already have the um tax in
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
them so I why do you say no explain the
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
debit card is just to show that you
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
remember and they took it take a swipe
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
of that so they can prove to the state
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
it was a Meals on Wheels program but uh
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
it it right now they do have the tax
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
included but this bill would change that
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
so it would not but but it doesn't cost
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
the state any because they turn around
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
and build the state a dollar less right
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
so my
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
whole so the whole question about the
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants billing the reasons the
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
vouchers work now is because the voucher
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
costs whatever the price of the meal is
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
the it covers plus the tax so if it's a
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
$15 maybe it's I don't know $15 meal 13
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
$13 meal and then that includes
 
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.750 align:start position:0%
$13 meal and then that includes
tax

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
correct so that that was what we were
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
trying to get at so B 12 so tax wouldn't
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
differentiate well it's up to you you
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
can certainly say something
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.310 align:start position:0%
can certainly say something
else

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
all right well let's then let's see
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
where people are on this again it's
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
non-binding uh how many people are for
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
OTP on the
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
1191 so one two three four five six 78
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:09.589 align:start position:0%
 
remaining

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna I don't want to hold it up
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not going to keep it off the
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
consent calendar I just have concerns
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
about the fact that that there's no
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
income criteria for people to get this
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
voucher and I
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
also you know I I don't know the rest I
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure that the
 
00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:40.710 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure that the
restaurants

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
understand the tax part but you know
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not that big a deal to me
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
up those who didn't raise their hands do
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
they want to say anything else about
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.630 align:start position:0%
they want to say anything else about
this

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman yeah just a comment to
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
my fellow representative here I don't
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
think we should worry about the income
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh level of individuals because when
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
they come to a Meals on Wheels program
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere nobody says to them oh you
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
can't come in and eat because you earn
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
too much money even though you're over
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
65 or 60 or whatever it is like we do on
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
wilmet people come in we don't say
 
00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:26.599 align:start position:0%
anything about their income level they
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
just come in to have a meal they donate
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
a two or $3 whatever they can afford and
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
out they go I I just don't like the idea
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
of putting an income
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
ery correct me if I'm wrong but it's my
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that the income level or
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
the status of the individual is
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
determined when they apply for the uh
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
the card of the or to enter the program
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
um other than that you'd be giving out
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
money to every person over the age of
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
65 so can sure um so I'm I'm familiar
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
with um the meals that are provided in
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
the senior centers now under this
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
program that does the funding and the
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
way it works cuz I've I've gone there
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
and um you you go
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
in you you go to a desk and they tell
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
you you know you check in and they have
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
a sign that
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
says contributions they have a jar for
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
contributions and there might be a
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
little sign that says recommended
 
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
little sign that says recommended
contribution

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
$3 and but they they don't they're not
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
going to make you you're not required to
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
make a a contribution so there really
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's no income check on it and that's
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
part of the federal requirement for this
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.150 align:start position:0%
part of the federal requirement for this
program

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative PL can we ask you
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%

okay all
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
comments all right seeing we'll close
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
1191 we'll now open the work session on

HB

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
1254 relative to optional local public
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
occupancies rosone Ames I believe
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative Buco has a an amendment
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
on which we should test have before us
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
before we discuss this and
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
representative buo is here the
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment's been handed out to everybody
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay it's just a very short little half
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
half paragraph and um so I would
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
recommend that we hear from uh
 
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
recommend that we hear from uh
representative

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
buo this if this amendment needs to be
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored by somebody sitting on the
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
that okay why don't we take um a minute
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
ourselves

00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
all right is uh representative uh bov
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh so this this amendment
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
just I'm trying I'm trying to answer
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
some some of the questions that came up
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
during the the uh public hearing last
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
week and so there was no dollar amount
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill and so we um drafted this
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to put the $2 per uh $2 per
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
day per
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
day

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
and $2 per occupancy per 24hour
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
period shall not exceed $2 for the 24
 
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
period shall not exceed $2 for the 24
hour

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.309 align:start position:0%
hour
period

00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
um if the occupancy is exceeds $40 then
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
the occupancy fee is not
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
collected and um the length of time is
 
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 184 days so that it's not
 
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.349 align:start position:0%
not to exceed 184 days so that it's not
permanent

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions any questions yes
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative PL well this certainly
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
improves it because because there's a
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
dollar amount place but uh you just the
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
bill just says
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
hotels and uh there's lots of uh a bnbs
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
and other types like that uh What uh
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
that would that apply to these rentals
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
as well I have I have the actual
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
definitions from statute can I pass this
 
00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:24.430 align:start position:0%
definitions from statute can I pass this
out

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's I think that occupancy definition
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
will be important because this could
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
also affect um just normal landlord
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
rentals that you know 3 months four
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
months um well this is the this is the
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
state statute so well we'll take we'll
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
look

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
no those there's two different ones
 
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.710 align:start position:0%
no those there's two different ones
they

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes oh oh sorry I made him I shouldn't
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
have done that but I supposed to cross
 
00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:54.270 align:start position:0%
have done that but I supposed to cross
like

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
that okay so you are giving us the
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
definition of Hotel um hotel is
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
six okay you who's asking me that you in

00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's on the first page under
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
under the chapter um 78a tax on meals
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
and rooms that I just passed
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
out well I guess I think it's
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted isn't it it is I guess my
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
concern would be the last word of the
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
first page and apartments um so
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
effectively the word hotel is being used
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
for virtually every single type of um
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
housing so that means landlords uh with
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
apartments that maybe they have someone
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
who you know it's month to month they go
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
four months six months and now they're
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
in that category um of it seems like
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
this could get a
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
little confusing in my mind uh
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative leapley followed by
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
representative leapley followed by
represent

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
Bolton I just have um a comment and a
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
question so my first comment would be
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
so is this
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
better this is the current law So
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
currently this appears to be
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
working so landlords currently aren't
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
charging uh meals and rooms tax to
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
people they're renting out for a year
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
lease um my question would be
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
can given that this is the state law can
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
a town let's say the town has you know a
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
rooming situation where you know they
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
put certain a certain population they
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to tax let's say could the
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
could the town clarify that when they
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
tax when they I'm sorry when they this
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
is just enabling so I'm assuming the
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
town would write something
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
saying the these people must charge $2 a
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
room in these situations so could the
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
town make it more clear where the $2 is
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
being charged or does the the town
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
just go based on the state law sorry if
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
that wasn't clear so I I believe that
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
they probably could the whole the the
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
point of this is point of this was that
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
the legislative body actually has votes
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
on whether to have this or not or
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
whether to resend it or not or how much
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
to how much to spend how much to uh
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
charge and
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
also how how how long that you know
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's why the the 184 days is in there
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
because if if it's permanent residents
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
are not being charged this followup
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
follow so if if I understand
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
correctly this is enabling legislation
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the town would be enabled to set
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
something up maybe they want to charge
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
$2 uh maybe they want to focus on a
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
certain type of like let's say what we
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
would call hotels only the town could
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
make that clear in their statute yes
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying represent Bolton thank you Mr
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
chair so um to expand on your
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
observation that it also includes um
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
what was it College camps Barracks but
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
also dormatory
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
and you know we have a university in the
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
town of Plymouth and I'm quite certain
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
that they would not allow us to charge
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
$2 you know per per day
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but it would be certainly nice if
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
that were the case but you know I think
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's the problem with uh you know the
 
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.829 align:start position:0%
that's the problem with uh you know the
the

00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah and um I you know full
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure I am a landlord I know
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of lot of people who are
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
landlords my concern would be the $2
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't sell like much but if somebody
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
is in for 6 months that's um 180 time2
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
$360 rents are high enough it could
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
encourage landlords to increase rents to
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
cover that cost um over here I saw hands
 
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.710 align:start position:0%
cover that cost um over here I saw hands
representative

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
Olie thank you representative for taking
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh questions I appreciate it um you've
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
details putting a fiscal note in here or
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
a dollar value to whatever the fee is
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
but the question goes back to why is it
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
good State policy to allow a checker
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
board of different taxation across the
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
state different localities why is that
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
good consistent tax policy when it
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
violates most of
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
the uh form if you will for
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
taxation well represent of the the
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
expenses that are incurred by
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
industry they're they're they're the
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
different in every town too that that's
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
what happened that's what's happening
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
here when we have 3,000 hotel
 
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
here when we have 3,000 hotel
rooms

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry i u
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
that well so the the the expenses are
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
are check aboard
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
also so we we we have a we have a town
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
that has a big tourist tourism industry
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
and the population swells from 10,000 to
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
30,000 on weekends and in the
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
summertime and and
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
so what the the selectman came to us and
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
said can we do something to relieve the
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
the property tax
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
because the The increased expenses of
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
especially for First Responders and uh
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
emergency and
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
police um those those expenses are are
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
much higher than and and they're falling
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
follow perhaps you didn't quite
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm saying
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
you've got a patchwork of Taxation that
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
is different and the the the valuation
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
of a meals and rooms tax at uh 8 and a
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
half% is the same across the state every
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
place that you go to this would be $2
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
here but the next town over doesn't have
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
$2 right and the next town over has $2
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
and three Towns over has $2 but it's not
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
the same this would create
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
um a patchwork of
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
variation to be administered in some
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
addition let's take Lon for example Lon
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
is a Small Town Loon is a small is a
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
large town on weekends
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
season and yet they're going to get
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
there 30 what is it 30% goes to the town
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
something like that they're going to get
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
their percentage of the 8 and a half%
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
from the increase of each one of that uh
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
each person that's there who goes in and
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
buys a meal at one of the nice
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants or one of the little stores
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
down there or even the Dunkin Donuts
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
right off the highway I
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:59.109 align:start position:0%
right off the highway I
just

00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the question goes back
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
to why is creating that Patchwork
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state and to its uh
 
00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:14.910 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state and to its uh
marketing

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.589 align:start position:0%
 
campaign

00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
well I don't know uh it's it's it it's
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's not to the state the benefit is
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
going to the municipalities
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
because they they because they haven't
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
to the benefit will go to the state
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
through the meals and rooms
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
revenues because because the the the
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
towns that have increased tourism bring
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
that draw that
 
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.349 align:start position:0%
that draw that
in

00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
and so okay representative ORS I'm not I
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm answering you correctly
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
but thank you Mr chair uh I like the
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
idea of relieving would you believe I I
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
like this idea of relieving the burden
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
on the local communities especially
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
these small communities that become huge
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
communities at certain times of the year
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
like Penn State College and Pennsyvania
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
on a game day weekend becomes the third
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
largest city in Pennsylvania so I
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to do I
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't think you're here you're there yet
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm all for Shifting the burden to
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
the tourists that are coming up here and
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
enjoying what we have to offer and
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
relieving the burden on the taxpayers I
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
just think this needs more work needs to
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
be thought out better thank you
 
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.910 align:start position:0%
be thought out better thank you
representative

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
fellow um I I
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
recall a bill like this being in a
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
municipal and County committee last year
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
are do you
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
know did you have this bill before
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
before or do you know about this bill
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
before I I did not have this bill before
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
but I but I did see I did see some of
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
those that I used in
 
00:54:05.599 --> 00:54:07.630 align:start position:0%
those that I used in
research

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
um and and took some took some of the
 
00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.390 align:start position:0%
um and and took some took some of the
language

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
so if we if we did pass this bill would
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
it go to Municipal and County my
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
recollection is that they didn't like it
 
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
recollection is that they didn't like it
at

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
all I'm not sure on that well is it you
 
00:54:33.549 --> 00:54:33.559 align:start position:0%
know um if it needs work I I we we don't
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
you know we agree you
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
can um amend it as you as you need to in
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
and so I guess that would mean at least
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
um interim study if it needs more
 
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
time I I agree with representative ores
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
that in general what you're trying to do
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense um and the question is um
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
how best to do it I think um represent
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
leap Lee followed by representative
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
PL thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
um I think the discussion's been very
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking so far and um the
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
thought that comes to mind is that it
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
sounds like what people are saying is we
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that towns have different
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
needs and and they have different you
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
know population flows throughout the
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
season because we're such a beautiful
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
state um it sounds like what we would
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
prefer is to
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
increase the tax on meals and rooms and
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
I know one of the other bills we're
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
considering um at some point is
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh Bill to decrease the tax on meals and
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
rooms which would be you know a non
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
Patchwork solution so my question to you
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
is if
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
the the people who came to you with a
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
problem saying hey you know people would
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
really love to live in our town um but
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's becoming increasingly hard because
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
we are shouldering the burden of all of
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
these tourists that come in and they're
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
not paying their fair share we're paying
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
for all of the police emergency whatever
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
is required whatever city services are
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
needed and the you know everyday folks
 
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:26.039 align:start position:0%
uh nurses police men can't afford to
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
live in our town anymore we need a
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem do you um so it
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
seems like the obviously we want to find
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
the best solution to that problem would
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
a solution to that problem be to raise
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
the tax on meals and rooms is it that
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
your town is not getting enough money
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
back um on that tax so I guess my
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
question is do you feel like that would
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
be a solution to the
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
problem well the the town is not getting
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
is already not getting it what it needs
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
through meals and rooms that's what Pro
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
that's what provoked you know uh
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
in thank you represent
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
PL I had a variant on that question um
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
right now I I think the percent back to
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
towns uh cities and towns out of the
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
rooms of meals tax I I'm remembering 40%
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
I might be wrong 30 okay it was higher
 
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
when the rooms and meals tax was
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
initially imposed if the legislature in
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
a future budget did increase that
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
percentage would that help rather than
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
having a separate two doll tax it would
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
it would certainly help if if the
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities got got um a
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
proportionate share proportionate to
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
their expenses right now they're not
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
getting that they're getting it based on
 
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.230 align:start position:0%
getting that they're getting it based on
population

00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
well let me just correct something I
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
believe uh the de facto rate that was
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
being sent back was
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
22% um we raised it from 22 to 30 no
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean it was so it it's
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
we've actually deao it was 22 we we set
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
set it I think it was last year uh to
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
30% so so that percentage actually is
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
higher than than it has been um so I
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean obviously there's still an issue
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
but but the rate has I just want to
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
correct that that the rate has uh
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
increased um I let me just follow up
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
with representative spillsbury yeah I I
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
think the committee should uh return to
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
a work session where we can discuss and
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
debate amongst ourselves are we ready to
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
do that possibly did anyone else have
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you thank
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.630 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you thank
you

00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Ames on that note
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I think there's a variety of
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill is drafted maybe
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
they could be uh addressed and
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
improved um for example I think that
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
when you get to
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
184 days in this amendment you know
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
isn't that isn't that
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
residence the whole point of the meals
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
and rooms is to distinguish between uh
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
visitors and uh and doile and Most
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
states once you're in a place for 180
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
days or more you're literally a doile of
 
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.990 align:start position:0%
days or more you're literally a doile of
that

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
location so there are other
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
imperfections I think what I can
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
Envision and it's been alluded to by
 
00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:48.390 align:start position:0%
Envision and it's been alluded to by
representative

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.670 align:start position:0%
representative
leapley

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
leapley
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
is I get it we currently take 30% could
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
be 22 could be 40 it was originally
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
40 and we pull we pull all meals and
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and we distribute pra across the
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
state according to population that works
 
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
out very well for my constituency
 
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
because we have virtually
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
no um meals and rooms capacity Sullivan
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
County has the least pull in terms of
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
generating meals and rooms so I don't
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
want to give up the 30% but I I think
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
that the argument being made
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
by Advocates from Portsmouth and Conway
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth and so on is is very strong
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
so the question is how do you do it you
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
know if if if you
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
recognize the demands on their safety
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
services and and roadways
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
Etc I would think and and I think this
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
is a 2025 project not a 2024
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
Resurrection uh we've got a variety of
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
bills that suggest reducing the meals
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax and there's certainly a
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
sentiment for that amongst some
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives why not take these
 
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:08.039 align:start position:0%
things and merge them together with the
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
concept that uh the meals and rooms tax
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
comes down uh by one or one and a half%
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
say to seven or seven and a half but the
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
municipality is allowed to search charge
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
it by one or one and a half percent con
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
continue to distribute this 30% of the
 
01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
continue to distribute this 30% of the
state's

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
state's
 
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
state's
pool

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
pra but allow for that other portion to
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
go directed to where the service demand
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
is most under stress there are many
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
states that do this what it would
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
exactly look like in the Drafting and
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
and so on you know if there's interest
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
in the committee I'd certainly be
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
willing to work towards a bill of that
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
sort in
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
2025 but but coming up with a completely
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
new fee that's administered and
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
collected entirely
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
locally doing it in the way this bill
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
suggests I don't feel that I'm prepared
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
to vote for that this year next year
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
we've got a a budget cycle year and uh
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a better
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
approach that's a very interesting
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
approach uh definitely could um have
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
some Merit representative um Rochford
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and I
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
my colleague down at the end of the
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
table is far more eloquent than I am and
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm glad that he was able to um
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
summarize that but but I I I I I can
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
empathize with Conway and Portsmith and
 
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
some of those other towns in that the
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
time that I come through is very similar
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
we have a population of 5800 but on any
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
given day could be 25,000 because we're
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
we're a draw and we're we're
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing a lot of the same things
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
that uh that we heard here but and and I
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
think representative leapley summarized
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
it as well and and and um of course what
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard I think it's not
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily A I think I think we need as
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
a committee to get a little more
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
creative with the policy rather than
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
just tax more uh because it is more
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
nuanced it is more there is more to uh
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
the issue than just collecting more um
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
you know my colleague across the room
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
brought up uh Lincoln and and you can't
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
get through Lincoln and and and on a on
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
a average day this time of year because
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's so crowded but they do they
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
generate a huge amount of revenue for
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state and it's their police that's
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
taxed their fire that's taxed um they
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
give they send the money out of town and
 
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
they're only getting a small per portion
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
of that so again I think representative
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
spillsbury had it right and I would be
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
happy to work on that with him and it's
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
not so much I think I think the issue is
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
valid but I think
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
we have to take on the issue and get
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
more a nuanced policy to most
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
adequately address the issue thank you
 
01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
adequately address the issue thank you
representative

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
Ames uh I guess several things one is um
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
I think what we've just been talking
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
about and hearing suggestions on is
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of this bill um you're
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
getting into and I think uh
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury said as much
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
this is an FY 25 a next year project for
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
something like that um it is also the
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
case that uh that kind of bill has been
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
presented in the past more than once
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
while I've been in this seat and it's
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
gone nowhere I think there we we would
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
hear from Dr about uh identifying the
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
source of the money that comes into the
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
state it's often paid by a central
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
collecting point so it may not it may be
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
some small town where the address is
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
that's sending in the revenue and in
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
fact Conway wouldn't uh uh be shown as
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
the source on McDonald's uh remittances
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
for example um so there are
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
complications that's all I'm saying I
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to get into that
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
discussion um I think we have in front
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
of our us a bill that calls for uh
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
enabling localities to Institute attacks
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
on hotels and on occupancies in hotels
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
those are the two uh words of art um
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
that are defined somewhere else but we
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
defined for a different purpose to
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
representative lepley's question I
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
actually think that this would have to
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
be amended to enable the municipalities
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune that language to Target on
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh a subset of the hotel category um but
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
that could be done and um I I would be
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
willing to work on an amendment like
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
this I'm not one of the original
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
proponents of this I think find it an
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
interesting proposal and I'd like to
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
have the best version of that in front
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
of us um but I'm willing to work on it
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
only if there's sentiment that that will
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
go somewhere in this committee so I'll
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
be interested in a in a STW poll on that
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'd say the work that needs to be done
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
is to enable
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt a version of
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
this authorization that's less than the
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
whole that's described here so they can
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
pick what they want and one other
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
comment is that the 180 days um that's
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the definition I think um is um is a
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
distinction between short-term rentals
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
that are the subject of this tax today
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the rooms and meals tax and those
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
that are in a different C category that
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
are not subject to it that's all it is
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and again in terms of fine-tuning
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe that should be out of the picture
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
in amendment that we would do but um it
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
that that has a very
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
solid arig in the 180 days and it's an
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
attempt to avoid taxing long-term rental
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
um you know and that's that's the time
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
period that was chosen so that's my
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
comment I'd be interested in a short in
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
a uh straw pole and uh and see where
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
we're at and uh if we're headed for a
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
dead end well we're headed for a dead
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
end you know
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
shamber thank you Mr chairman uh I agree
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
with representative Ames the the the
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
towns and cities have come here with a
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
problem and they have
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
suggested approaches to this
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
problem and they're looking for for the
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
state to say okay this is very creative
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever and representative Ames has
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
haded added the I think the the part
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to be added to this bill to
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh I don't
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
see a reduction in the meals and rooms
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
or taking more money here or there uh
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's taken away from the what this
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill is about and it also affects our
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
public education trust system uh the
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
funds going into that so I think that
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ames has put forth a a
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
positive way to address the cities and
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
towns that need to have this thank
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
fellows so I think there certainly are
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
cases in in in many towns where tourists
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
cause the
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
the um municipality to have to expend
 
01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
the um municipality to have to expend
more

01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
money there's not
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
always um this is not the tourists that
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
that um create the need for police
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
primarily I think it's mostly police
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
maybe you know Ambulance Service are not
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily the people who are in hotel
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
rooms because an example of this would
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
be in my town we we have a full-time
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
police officer during the summer and the
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
fall because of hikers coming into the
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
state and parking alongside of the road
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
and with the potential to block the road
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
when they they want to hike in the
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
mountains around my town and this has
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
been going on for years we don't have
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
very many hotels in we have some but not
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
very many so that that's one you know
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
the Nexus between the increase of cost
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the idea that you can recover the
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
money from just hotel rooms the other
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
thing that I'd like to point out is for
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
every single hotel room that
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
exists that municipality is is
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
collecting more than $1,000 a year from
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
that room you know not not NE not the
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
bnbs but you know regular hotels on the
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're collecting it through the
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
property tax so they are getting
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
significant contribution from from those
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
um the people who use the the hotels and
 
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.030 align:start position:0%
um the people who use the the hotels and
the

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
airbnbs so I I think I'd rather not see
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire go down the road of of
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
having to tell tourists you know you
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
know we know the tourists w know that
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
they they always get the the tax on
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
their hotel bill whatever percent it is
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
but let's not go down the road of saying
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
and then there may be another tax on
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
your on your bill because my
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
recollection of the testimony I heard in
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal and county is that tourists
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
really hate to see that extra line of
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
tax they're they don't mind one line of
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
tax they expect that but they don't like
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
to see additional uh lines of taxes on
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
their hotel
 
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
builds well you raised an interesting
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
point about the the part where it's not
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
always the hotel um because a town like
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
Salem we while we do have a new hotel in
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
Tuscan Village the the number of
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
occupancies in Salem is very low however
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
Salem a town of population about
 
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
30,000 during the day every day the town
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
of Salem's population from what I've
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
read converg in up to 100,000 people
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
because we have so many shoppers so with
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
Salem it's retail and there's no we're
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
not going to collect much from hotels
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
but we still need a stronger police
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
presence we need uh I mean almost just
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
by chance I'm not driving through town
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
every day but it almost seems like one
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
out of every three days I see either an
 
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
emergency um an ambulance or a fir truck
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
responding to something so you know that
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
that would be my concern and in you know
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
to your point of it's not always
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
hotels Al although I recognize there is
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
a problem um in general um yes
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative shamberg I I'm not
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
sure I was grasping what you were saying
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
about the impact on local education
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
funding could you just clarify
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
that were we talking about the meals and
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
rooms tax I believe it was in the
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
context of uh the rate of the meals and
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
rooms and the concept of some of it
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
being shared to those communities that
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
have you know a lot of lodging visitors
 
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
I was concerned that if we're going to
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
share more of the meals and rooms it's
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
also going
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
to reduce our Revenue that we put into
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
the public education trust fund I don't
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
think any of other than car rentals none
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the meals and rooms Revenue goes into
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative PL I think representative
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
fellow's made an excellent point when
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
she mentioned property tax the fact that
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
the hotel exists in the first place
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
means that there's property tax on it so
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
there is revenue for the town and if
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's a robust Hotel uh busy I
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
would think that that would affect the
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
property value of it's taxed on up as
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to one that's got a barely
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
surviving that proper they could argue
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
with lower property tax so the town is
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
now anything
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
nothing um I will close the uh work
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
1254

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
1254
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
um actually I'm going to reopen the work
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
session for a second
 
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you for coming um I'm
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
reopening it uh primarily because I I
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
forgot to do a stop hole
 
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah did you want to say
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
something yes if I could
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
add I like what I heard with
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
what what dick Ames said here and the
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and anything that
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
shifts the birden into the tourist who
 
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
are if you will creating the need and
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
takes the burden off the locally local
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers and those that live
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
in these towns is something I am
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
for thank you um so let's see how best
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
to phrase this I guess um how many well
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
first we can start with how many people
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
um would like to see this OTP or otpd
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
with a type of um potential amendment
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
that representative Ames is suggesting
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
show off hands one two three four five
 
01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:41.590 align:start position:0%
show off hands one two three four five
six

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
seven um how many
 
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.709 align:start position:0%
seven um how many
against

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:15:45.719 --> 01:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
against
one

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
two myself three four five six seven
 
01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay we're I think it needs work we're
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
we're missing
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
some how much time do how much time do
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
we have for for this bill I mean in
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
terms of days when does when does it
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
have to leave us uh all the bills in
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means um none of them are early
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
bills oh good so it doesn't uh I mean on
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
one hand we need to process through
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
bills if we know how we want to go with
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
them the other hand we do have time yeah
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
them the other hand we do have time yeah
well

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
so um yes representative sod I just
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that miss this all
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh the major tax burden in towns are
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
schools and their enrollments are
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
dropping so perhaps we should look to
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
well uh yes Le I just want to point out
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
that and I live in Manchester and our
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
enrollments have dropped a little bit um
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
but doesn't cost less to run the schools
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
right we we it hasn't dropped so much
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we're like closing schools and
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
firing people
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
so yes enrollments are going down across
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
the state but that doesn't translate I
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
think the the shorthand of per pupil
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
expense kind of um confuses us to think
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
oh it cost that amount to educate a kid
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
so you take one kid out you save
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
$122,000 it the math doesn't work that
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
way um and the money is not would not
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
come from school boards right it's
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
property taxes where that money is
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
coming from but obviously that is a huge
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
expense in our
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
state okay all right I'm going to close
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh the work session
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
1254

01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna open the uh public
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
session on not public I'm going to open
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
1515 relative to the meals and rooms
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
tax and let's
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:30.350 align:start position:0%
tax and let's
see

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
still trying to find it there it is
 
01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.750 align:start position:0%
still trying to find it there it is
representative

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
PL this and uh other bills to try to
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
reduce tax this year I think it's the
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
wrong year I think that uh right now
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're running a surplus in uh in plan
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
over plan but it's last I looked was
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
around $100
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
million uh that that's great but it's
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
not huge in the impact of the overall
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
bium and so I would want to defer any
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
talk about reinstating first of all a uh
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
year representative spillsbury
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the point I was going to lead
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
with so I'll Echo that point I think
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's the wrong year to be considering
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
this um we can always be thinking about
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
it uh and without getting back into it
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
we could be thinking in terms of the
 
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of the last bill and
 
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
coordinating those two concepts for next
 
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
year I I would also just make one other
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
incidental comment and that
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm not warm to section two of
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
this bill which picks a figure and
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
freezes it uh for the revenue sharing I
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
I think we should you know we we we
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
depend upon meals and
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and to the tune of 30% Revenue
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
sharing our communities depend upon
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
their share and I think that should
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
float we should evalue the rate next
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
year in the context of where our budget
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
Ames well I agree with my colleagues
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
um and um maybe I have a
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
different long-term goal than they but I
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
think it's absolutely right this is not
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
a bud budget year um we're coming off of
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of years of where we've uh
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
been maybe three years I'm not sure with
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh we've been uh blessed with a huge
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
infusion huge infusion of federal money
 
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.750 align:start position:0%
infusion huge infusion of federal money
uh

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
unprecedented uh that was a result of
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and um that's going away
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
the picture is cloudy where we are
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue wise the big generator of taxes
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
has been the business profits tax and uh
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax um and um
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
what where will they be a year from now
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
or two years from now um truth is
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who's honest about this uh
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
cannot really predict that because there
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
are too many variables uh the the
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
broader economy the local economy um are
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
are the terms of of the tax itself which
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
is switched over to a single sales
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
factor and that's just coming into view
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think uh although we have not been
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
briefed on that yet by Dr but that's a
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
big change in uh in the U way in which
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
the uh uh tax identifies the taxable
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
revenues um so um to
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
to take out of the revenue stream an
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money given all of that and
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
given the other truth that there we've
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
got pressing needs in a budget you go
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
through the process and you do what you
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
can do with the money you've got and uh
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
this past time around I think the budget
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
makers the people at the center of that
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
activity did a great job we all came
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
together around a budget but in the end
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
a budget is a
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
is doing what you can best do with what
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
you've got and um that's what we came to
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
we did what we could best do with what
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
was available to us in revenues nothing
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
extra nothing fat um just uh a good
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
budget with what we had but that doesn't
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
mean that we took care of all the needs
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I won't go through a list I'm sure
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
everybody could make their own list
 
01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
publicly or privately on that I have
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
happen to be in the thick of the public
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
school funding issue as is
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury we're both
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
sitting on a special committee to
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
address school funding and thinking hard
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
about uh you know how to how to deal
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
with that issue and maybe the outcome
 
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
for some of us on that subcommittee or
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
in the larger committee the education
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
committee will uh see no need to go
 
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
further with the state money than we do
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
now but Others May see an opportunity to
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
switch State money for
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
state for local property tax money um
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so net net taxes don't change but
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh it does use more State money um and
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh we need to keep that open in my
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
judgment so I hope I my plea is not to
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
go down that uh uh shrinking of the uh
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
tax revenues pathway at at certainly at
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
this juncture it's not a budget year I
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad time to do
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
you sure yes oh okay I'm use his light
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
from now on because I know it's very
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
hard yeah I'm sorry but he's he'll help
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
me um I agree with all the previous
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
speakers I think this would be a good
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
time to pause both reductions and
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
increases in taxes for this particular
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
year um I'm concerned I think the YDC
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is going to cost much more than
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
$100 million we're just beginning to see
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
results of that and we don't know what's
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to happen with the education
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
funding and those are two really big
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
things that could reduce our Surplus
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
very quickly um and then we've made so
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
many changes already and we haven't even

arpet type funds all going away so it
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%

1531 and um I'm going to invite uh Dr up
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh at this time because I know I have a
 
01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:21.639 align:start position:0%
question even though I may be the prime
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
bill morning U my name is Keen mang Wong
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
Texas police council with the new H dep
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
depart Revenue um I'm here to answer
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I think the um
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
the first question is going to be um you
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
know when we look at these three 1533
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
seems fairly straightforward but uh
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
1531 um can you explain well first
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
explain what that what sort of
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
depreciable property does this pertain
 
01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
to uh in general the depal property
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
would be those that are uh 20 years or
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
or less uh of the uh depreciable life um
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of overlap between this
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
property that's uh qualified in for 168k
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
deduction um so a uh like a
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
Machinery that could qualify for um this
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
bonus depreciation could potentially
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
also qualify for the um 179 deduction if
 
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
it was all
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's Federal Federal yeah and
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
that's Bill 15 uh 36 is going address
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
the first year um the first year
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
deduction so Mr
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah 1531 and 1536 are so
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
interrelated because in fact the IRS
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
allows an election to take one or the
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
other but not both maybe we should talk
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
about them uh together to group them for
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this discussion okay
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh Point well taken um I guess EX
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
yeah explain to us um um section
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
79 right 179 so Section 179 uh deduction
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
is a first year deduction similar to
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
um 168k uh when the business acquires uh
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
a property and place it into service in
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
that particular year um the business if
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
that asset qualifies the business would
 
01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
be able to take a firste deduction to ex
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to depreciating that property
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
over the life of the asset the business
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
has the ability to um claim that expense
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
as a deduction in the first year of
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
placing it into service so that 179
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
expense currently deduction currently is
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh a deduction that's allowed for New
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business profits tax purposes
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh it is currently limited to but the
 
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
aggregate amount of deduction is
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
currently limited to a million
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
80,000 uh no for for New Hampshire for
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is um that's Federal
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking yeah that's the federal
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
number yeah
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah New Hampshire is uh currently
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
um 500,000 500,000 y currently is
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
$500,000 the uh HB 1536 intends to
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
increase that to a million dollar right
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
and and the federal is what you although
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
I think I heard the federal um I think
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
the federal was adjusted up to a million
 
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
160 for
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
2023 yes okay
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and let's just go I'll get you in a
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
minute representative PL let's just go
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
back to uh
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
section 168 again 168 um is for all
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
property 20 years or less and is it how
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
does that work is that first year only
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
so it is uh it is first year as well
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's a bonus depreciation and then and
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's in the during the year that
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
placed in
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
service um and for federal the amount
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
the allowed amount of um I guess the the
 
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
percentage that's allowed to take as a
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
deduction is decreased year over year um
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.790 align:start position:0%
 
with

01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh starting with which year let me see I
 
01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
don't have that right in front of me but
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
it does start um decreasing 20% year
 
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
over year and then it goes to zero in
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
2027 um and so that's the current law on
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
the federal side so on the federal side
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
bonus depreciation for Section 168
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
property goes away in whatever number
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
next yeah in 2027 when for assets
 
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
placing service after 2027 right um and
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
then uh the the HB
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
1531 is to and we currently do not um
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
allow the bonus depreciation deduction
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
for BPT purposes
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
1531 allows puts that into uh anex that
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
um deduction and allows that deduction
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
for BPT purposes and then
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
also does not does not adopt the uh the
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
the federal phase out and keeps it at
 
01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.270 align:start position:0%
the federal phase out and keeps it at
100

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
% um can you just explain then the
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
difference some of the property I think
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
you said some of the depreciable
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
property between section 168 and
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
179 could fall in the same category so
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
yeah does a business decide
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
which so when a when an when an asset
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
does does qualify for both 179 and
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
168k the priority would be on the
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
federal side the priority would be
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
taking the 79 deduction first and then
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
if there is additional um because the
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
179 deduction there are some limitations
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
calculation um and then when there are
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
more qualified assets than allowed us to
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
deduction then the taxpayer has the
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
option well the taxpayer would then take
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
the 168k for the remaining
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
um remaining basis of the asset that was
 
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.109 align:start position:0%
um remaining basis of the asset that was
not

01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
deducted uh and through 179 and take it
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
168k all right representative PL thank
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to confirm before I make a
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
statement this uh well uh if we were to
 
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
pass both of these it could have a
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
short-term negative impact on Revenue
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
but uh overall it's Revenue neutral is
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
it not
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
because the future years they won't be
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
able to take the depreciation they
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
already took it right that is correct
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yes so my statement is I'm I look
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
much more kindly on the these than I do
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
did uh out andout tax rate reductions on
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
previous bills because it is revenue
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
neutral long term and it it's uh
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
friendly to business yeah it's more
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
Ames basically I I share that
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
perspective just uh uh just stated
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
perspective but on these uh these kinds
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
of changes but uh I do have uh I don't
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
really understand uh on 1531
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
why uh we would push the applicable
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
percentage for this Bon I think it's
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
called bonus
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
depreciation up to 100% And the federal
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
law law what what is it down to
 
01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.430 align:start position:0%
law law what what is it down to
[Music]

01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
now 40% 20% you don't have it in front
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
of I don't have it in front of me but um
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
and then just to just to add a little
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
wrinkle stepped down to 60% as of
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
December 31st 23 okay you've got got
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's already gone through two step
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
decreases that congruent with what you
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
think yes it's it's already been going
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
down already um and then um I mean it
 
01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
does not matter what I'm going to say
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
next is because of the the bill that was
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
just passed in on on the by the house
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
Federal US House us house um
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
the what's the name of it um something
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
about oh yeah
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
workers uh it also it actually U brings
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
it back up to 100% up to a certain year
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
I can't remember which year though but
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
then but then um for BPT purposes we are
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
not on a rolling Conformity with the
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
federal um right tax code so I I guess
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
as I said it doesn't really matter what
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing right now on the federal
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
tax code um because we are only
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
conforming to the December 3128 18 right
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
now TX code yeah so first point is that
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't make any bets on what the
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
Congress is going to do they still has
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
to pass the and uh after that um I think
 
01:36:35.679 --> 01:36:37.629 align:start position:0%
to pass the and uh after that um I think
um

01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:37.639 --> 01:36:39.629 align:start position:0%
um
that

01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
uh even if this is going up to 100%
 
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
federally usually where we do uh which
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
would be in accord with that going up
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
usually we follow the federal government
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
government on on uh tax code and uh
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to conform uh we
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
usually we don't go a go down a
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
different pathway with something totally
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
outside the bounds of that I there might
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
may be examples where we
 
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
do for the for the most part yes we
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
conform to the the code and then uh in
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
specific parts of our BPT statutes we
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
would have adjustments to to adjust uh
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
let's say the legislature decided to um
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
like like for the 179 deduction it was
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
at 500,000 for a good number of years so
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
to uh if we were simply to conform and
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
we have not conformed to bonus
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
depreciation to do that we do that
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
without the sentence in here which says
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
the applicable percentage shall mean
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
100% is that correct that is correct
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so I think that's a question for
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
us um I I don't know the consequences I
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
guess you don't either because of this
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
mishmash between different different
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
options that businesses have right but
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
somebody must be pushing for this and
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
and it must me make a difference for
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
somebody I don't know why this is in
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
front of us actually why there a felt
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
need with a uh a bonus depreciation
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
that's about to disappear at least
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
absence some congressional action that
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
may or may not happen represent
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury very similar comments so I can
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
be very brief I'm I'm not sure we should
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
be weighing in on this moving
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
Target yeah and uh yeah I I I think that
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
our it's not clear who's really for this
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
nobody came and testified on it I don't
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the impetus is I think
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
we're fine to leave our statute the way
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um yes representative shamber
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Kean uh
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh two
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
depreciation does the company identify
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
which type of depreciation they will
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
take on
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
their on the forms that you that are
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
provided to you like straight line or
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
declining balance or double declining
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the years digits do do they
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
identify those things or do
 
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
they or do you figure it out when you
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
see what they're wanting to deduct um I
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
I to be honest I cannot fully uh answer
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
that question I know that uh right now
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
for federal depreciation is the modified
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted cost reduction basis so it's
 
01:39:43.159 --> 01:39:43.830 align:start position:0%
adjusted cost reduction basis so it's
the

01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
makers uh format and then
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
um the double decline
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
in well it's just I'm not so much
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
worried about do they identify do they
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
tell the Dr no no no uh currently we
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
only look we would see how the assets
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
are depreciated either through the
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
federal forms that submitted or if that
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
information is not there and we need
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
more information um and if that
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers being audited then uh the
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
Auditors would request for more detailed
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
depreciation schedule okay follow up on
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
follow up and the second question I have
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
the dates that are on here when they
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
will be placed in service uh like on
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
1531 on line 8 it mentions about being
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
placed in service after December 31st
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
2024 C can these
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
dates be
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
changed or or or do they affect what the
 
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
the um present bills that or the present
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
tax law does it clear up anything by
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
moving the dates out further um
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
especially since we have the single
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
sales Factor uh I think what
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury has brought up
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
as maybe letting these work their way
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
out what we presently have before we
 
01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
address something like this is that what
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
spury yes thank you for the question it
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
is I I think it's crucially important
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
Whenever there is any kind of um tax
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
change we need to like's say for this
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
one we need to understand when it starts
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
and and so specifically for these kinds
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
of um bills that talks about
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
depreciation we need to know U which
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
asset would be subject to the this this
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
depreciation allowance and um so having
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
that clearly stated here for assets uh
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's placed in service after December
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
3124 so it would only apply to assets
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
place and service after that date and
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
not let's say if the bill was to pass at
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
a certain time and then you know okay
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
when it would apply so that I think it's
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
important to have that representative PL
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair all right um right
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
now we don't allow the 168 k at all
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct for BPT purposes if we
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
were to strike the line on line eight
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
the applicable percentages provided in
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
section 168 k6 shall mean 100% then we
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
would allow the
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
168 K uh adjustment but we would be
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
conforming with the federal law is that
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
correct with the phase out uh including
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
any phase out or reinstatement or
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
whatever happens the reinstatement is
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
after the December 31
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
2018 so we are following we're
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
conforming to the Internal Revenue code
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
as of December 31 2018 which does not
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
reinstatement okay but if the Federal
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
Law changes we'd follow it no the
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
Federal Law changes now would not be the
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code as of December 31
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
2018 we would have to have another bill
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
we we are currently following as he said
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
the 2018 version so no matter how it
 
01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
changes we're still following 2018 I
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
have okay so I'd be pushing for that
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
passing this but getting rid of the 100%
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
yes this is just to clarify a couple of
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
things make sure I understand for all
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
practical purposes when we have a
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
20year service life cut
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
off I think it's generally the case that
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
really only real
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
estate real property uh has a service
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
life longer than 20 years virtually any
 
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
kind of Capital Equipment I can think of
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
uh it's allowed uh more rapidly at least
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
roughly is is that a working distinction
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's mostly correct because
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
real estate is 37 and a half right and
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
then the second um so it's it's my
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
understanding uh generally that it's
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
always the year in which an asset is
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
placed in service yes that's correct uh
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
that that defines what the options are
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
and elections according to the Internal
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue code are taken in that tax year
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
and you know if you go for one for
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
straight line versus macrs and so on you
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
make that election I think you're stuck
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
with it for the life of the asset aren't
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
you you you're not just allowed to
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
freely change between uh um
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
methods U you know not without
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
justification there might be an
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
exception what to what I'm saying but I
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
believe it is generally correct that
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
you're you make your election and you
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
stick with it as far as I've seen I I
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't I've not seen um taxpayers
 
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
flipping uh from one um depreciation
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
method to another depreciation method
 
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
for any particular um property asset
 
01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:04.910 align:start position:0%
for any particular um property asset
property

01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
um during the life of that property yeah
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh if I jump hold on just a correction
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
or not a correction but a question you
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
said 37 A2 years for real estate isn't
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
it 27 A2 for residential unless you're
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
talking about commercial
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
37 there are several categories there's
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
there's different categories but
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
residential real estate I believe is 27
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
and a half uh I I may not be too
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
residential um yes so my point was just
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
that uh businesses can flip their
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
depreciation in my understanding my
 
01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
training what I've seen uh but it's rare
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
and they got to justify it they just
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
can't do it and say you know well I felt
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
good that day so MH yeah there's got to
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
be a good reason and they can't skew
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
their balance sheet Etc there there's it
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
gets complicated and and they might I I
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
believe in certain situations they might
 
01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
need to get approval from the IRS I
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
suppose yeah most likely um so the the
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
um I guess one question I would have is
 
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.229 align:start position:0%
um I guess one question I would have is
there's

01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
no limit let's say we are following the
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
federal law and it's at 100%
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
um There's No Limit such as in in um
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
Section 179 where the limit is 1 Point
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
whatever 06
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
million this section 168 or section 168
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't put any limit does it that's
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
correct there's no limit on the 168k so
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
I guess that's um uh that that's my
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
concern I didn't necessarily realize
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
that when I put this bill in so the No
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
Limit is is a concern um representative
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you um
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
that might answer one of my questions I
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
have two questions so one why is it
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
bonus um and two am I right in
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
understanding the
 
01:47:01.679 --> 01:47:03.270 align:start position:0%
understanding the
federal

01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
um statute ends in
 
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
2027 if we pass this would it because
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're not paralleling the federal right
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
it I don't see that this would also
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
expire in 2027 those are my two
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't answer the the
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
nomenclature of bonus okay maybe it's
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
because um it's an accelerated
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
depreciation okay um that makes sense
 
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh if we were to uh adopt this
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill but without the language of the
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
100% um it will follow the phase out of
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
the of the federal uh law right now
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
right um which is which would be 0% if
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
the ass that was placed in service after
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
27 okay it be 0% wait a minute is that
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
true because you just said we're still
 
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.310 align:start position:0%
true because you just said we're still
on

01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
2018 that's correct so the phase out is
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the 2018 oh it is okay yeah all right
 
01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to wrap it up I would
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
spillsbury said is that this is maybe
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and adds a layer of
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
complication to the tax code that is of
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative ORS thank you so if
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
we were to go to a three-year tax on
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
equipment over a million
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
dollars anything but real estate so uh
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
not a three-year I'm sorry a three-year
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
depreciation would that negatively
 
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:43.719 align:start position:0%
impact the state's Revenue that you know
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
of I mean if you to use your crystal
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
ball so any equipment over a million
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
dollars can depreciate over threee
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
period versus whatever and just
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
eliminate like a flat depreciation of
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
three years I believe if everything
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same it was it would be also
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
another timing issue because a timing um
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
concern because on the federal side the
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the the taxpayer is able to is
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
only able to claim the depreciation over
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
that life of the the asset versus in New
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were claiming over three years
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
and then um as after the three years the
 
01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire taxpayer would not be
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
able to claim the depreciation on that
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
because they've already fully claimed
 
01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:26.669 align:start position:0%
because they've already fully claimed
the

01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
depreciation um so it's all uh front
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
loaded the depreciation on that asset is
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
the deduction is front loaded for the
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
first three years and then for the
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
remaining years there won't be a so it's
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
a timing thing but do you think that
 
01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:41.350 align:start position:0%
a timing thing but do you think that
would

01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
negatively uh impact the state's Revenue
 
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
stream if we did something like that if
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
everything in other words to simplify it
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes if everything Remains the Same the
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
front loading of the depreciation means
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
you're increasing the deduction so
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
you're reducing your taxable income um
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
so you're reducing your BPT revenue for
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
those first three years yeah Y and then
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
it then you get it back in the ladder
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
it'll be a timing yeah yeah anything to
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
simplify it I think would be great thank
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
you representative fellas did you still
 
01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:15.639 align:start position:0%
have a question um yes and it's not a
 
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to educate myself so
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
you've been talking about about 170 I I
 
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.830 align:start position:0%
you've been talking about about 170 I I
understand

01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
168k what is is 179 is that a federal
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes it's a federal code and because you
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
made a statement that 179 is like 168k
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
and they're both Federal codes yes
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
they're both Federal codes what does 179
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
do so 179 is a first year deduction when
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
the uh asset is placed into service in
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
year one the the taxpayer would have the
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
option to claim the cost of that asset
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
as a deduction as opposed to claiming it
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
as a depreciation over the life of the
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
asset a deduction so is that just just
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
so I can follow so that's the same as
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
depreciating it 100% the first year
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
similar yes okay so they sound like the
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
same thing yes similar except that
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
except that
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
168 has has down and down so
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
179 that doesn't go down that's just it
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't go down but there there are uh
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
limitations on special not not all
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
assets uh not all assets similar to the
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
168k not all assets but however there is
 
01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:39.639 align:start position:0%
um you cannot claim the uh 179 deduction
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh in excess of the taxable income I
 
01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:43.719 align:start position:0%
believe it's taxable income so you can't
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
go into an nool you won't they won't
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
allow you to go into an nool position uh
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
when you're claiming at 179 for 68 you
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
can there's no limit to the 168 so
 
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
there's no limit yeah so you could
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually have a a loss and then apply
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
that loss to Future years right okay
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's helpful yes
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
followup I'm sorry and you're not
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to take both R you is it one or
 
01:52:07.679 --> 01:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
allowed to take both R you is it one or
the

01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
other uh if that is correct so but on a
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
particular asset you might be able to
 
01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
claim both but not on the same basis so
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
if the the basis of let's say $100,000
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the basis of the asset um let's say
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
um maybe $80,000 is claimed under1 179
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
and then you still have 20,000 remaining
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
bases which you might be able to claim
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
on the 168k oh my God can can I take the
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else yes represent flood I
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
remember Mr Wong that during the uh
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill public hearing both
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
you and I struggled over
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
macrs it's modified accelerated cost
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
recovery system
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
um I I'm inclined to um myself probably
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
just itl this
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
because um as I said when I put it in I
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
didn't realize there was no limit and um
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:53:24.669 --> 01:53:24.679 align:start position:0%
complicating this right now with limits
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh probably isn't the way to go um
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
so um quick STW on that uh yeah I
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
noticed um before you do the straw I
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
just like to agree with you Mr chairman
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
since I
 
01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
was the co-sponsor one of the
 
01:53:44.189 --> 01:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors from the other side of the
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
aisle that uh some of this information I
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
did not understand when we had it
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
written up and
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I thought we were looking at it
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
would stimulate investment it would it's
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
a uh it's a job hiring it's it's more
 
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
stable was my thought at the time I
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
think I think well that to that point I
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
think it still can stimulate business
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
activity but the question is how much
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
does it affect right business Revenue
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
especially where you can end up with an
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
no um so
 
01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
um that that's a concern whereas uh
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
actually HB
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
1536 you cannot end up with with a loss
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
and there is a limit so um it it it may
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
be that
 
01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:36.679 align:start position:0%
you may wish to uh have co-sponsor that
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
one instead but we'll see where your
 
01:54:38.239 --> 01:54:41.229 align:start position:0%
one instead but we'll see where your
thoughts

01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:48.189 --> 01:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
let's um let's take a straw Paul I think
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
we know the answer but how many people
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm going to close the um and
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Wong if you don't mind staying up
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
there because we're going to need you
 
01:55:19.229 --> 01:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
again um I'm going to close the U work
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
session on HB
 
01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:25.719 align:start position:0%
1531 we'll now open the work session HB
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
1533 this is relative to allowing
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
um relative the Safe Harbor compensation
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
amount under the business profits
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
tax and do I have comments or questions
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
on this representative fellows so I I
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
just need to understand what this is so
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what I think it is and
 
01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
you can tell me if I am on track or not
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
um so if you if you're a small business
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
you can claim a salary for
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
yourself but there's a limit on how high
 
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:05.800 align:start position:0%
that salary can go without
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
documentation uh yes that's
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
correct right so so the limit right now
 
01:56:11.719 --> 01:56:13.030 align:start position:0%
correct right so so the limit right now
is

01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
75,000 and um I guess I'll ask you a
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
1533 the last time that was um updated
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
to the 75,000 I believe I'm not finding
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
it now but I think it was around 2011 or
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
2011 and so it has been uh 13 years uh
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
at 75,000 so the thought here was that
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh with inflation this should be raised
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
I like this bill um one of the things I
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
did is I noticed that it says it doesn't
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
it it it can go up every year um based
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
on the Consumer Price Index but it's
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
not um doesn't go up based on a single
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
year change in the Consumer Price Index
 
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's averaged over two years and uh I'm
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
from familar with using the cons
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index as a way to to keep
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
up with cost in when it comes to
 
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy a education and in that bill um
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
the when I worked on it and put it
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
together the governor changed it but it
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
was a three-year average and it's good
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
to have that average because it can be
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
very spiky in terms of the Consumer
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
Price Index being high one year and then
 
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
low another year year so even evening
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
this out is a good idea thank you
 
01:57:54.639 --> 01:57:57.149 align:start position:0%
this out is a good idea thank you
representative

01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
Ames I I support this bill um I just
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that uh in case uh
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
some aren't aware of it it underlying
 
01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.350 align:start position:0%
some aren't aware of it it underlying
this

01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:58:10.589 --> 01:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
uh this uh
 
01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
deduction that's available um is a uh a
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable compensation Rule and
 
01:58:20.830 --> 01:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
basically this is carving out a safe
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
harbor so that if you're below the
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
amount that that's going to be specified
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
that is currently specified basically Dr
 
01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:31.639 align:start position:0%
and its Auditors aren't going to be able
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
to challenge you or um mostly will not
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
because they've got too high too steep a
 
01:58:43.229 --> 01:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
hill to climb to defeat uh a claim for
 
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh of compensation that's under that
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
limit um but once you're above that the
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
rule is there it's reasonable
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
compensation and uh if somebody claims a
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the value of his or
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
her Services during the past year and it
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
just doesn't correlate with anything I
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
suspect the Dr will be uh tracking that
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
down and um and applying a lot of rules
 
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
that have developed over a long period
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
of time around reasonable compensation
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
to question the validity of that choice
 
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
is that right yes uh so this this
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
threshold is mainly for um any kind of
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
documentation um that is required um uh
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
if if the total the compensation that is
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
paid U is for the personal services is
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know less than
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
$75,000 the the area would not request
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
for any kind of documentation to for uh
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so I support it thank
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
you anybody else representative SP yeah
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
and and just to clarify that it's not
 
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
just Dr practices it is our statute that
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
says in lie of substantiating the value
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot as a recordkeeping safe
 
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
harbor so um you know Medical Practice
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh might be able to justify an a
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
personal income of 300 or 400,000 who
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
knows right with
 
02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.430 align:start position:0%
knows right with
documentation

02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
02:00:18.189 --> 02:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
right uh okay why don't we take a straw
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
you we'll close the uh work session on
 
02:00:31.119 --> 02:00:33.430 align:start position:0%
you we'll close the uh work session on
HP

02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
HP
 
02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
1533 well given that we're making such
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
great progress today I I had thought we
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
were going to take a lunch break and
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
continue but we were going good so we
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
will finish go to our last
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
um bill of the day I'll open the work
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
session on hb1
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:51.229 align:start position:0%
session on hb1
1536

02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
which is relative to increasing the
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
amount of the expense deduction allowed
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
against business profits tax so now and
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
we've we've asked some questions on on
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about this one is
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
pertaining to section
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
171 of the tax code which um 17 I'm
 
02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
171 of the tax code which um 17 I'm
sorry

02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:11.030 align:start position:0%
sorry
179

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
179
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and um it is proposing
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
to increase the uh total dedu deduction
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
on an asset
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
from 500,000 to 1 million and I think at
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
the federal level as in our previous
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
discussion we said the federal is
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
1.16 million was it representative
 
02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.550 align:start position:0%
1.16 million was it representative
spillsbury

02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.950 --> 02:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
okay mic oh I'm sorry I'm sorry yes a
 
02:01:52.069 --> 02:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
milon 160 is the adjustment effective
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
for tax year
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
2023 yeah at at the federal level uh
 
02:01:59.310 --> 02:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we were not in line with the federal
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
level before at 500 I don't believe were
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
we uh when we first put it at 500,000 I
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
I I don't recall the um the history on
 
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
this okay um but I do know that U on the
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
federal site right now um the the reason
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
why the amount keeps increasing year
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
over year is just because the uh the
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
threshold on the federal side is
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation whereas on our
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute it's it's a fixed
 
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
number interesting okay so when we set
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
it at
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
500,000 um I think in
 
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
2015 or so some 15 17 somewhere in there
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
could be yeah I I apologize I don't have
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
the that's okay my my point is that
 
02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
there was an inflation adjustment back
 
02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
then to to 500 but the question or I
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
don't know how directly it was tied
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
so to your point of on the federal level
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
we are tracking or they are tracking
 
02:03:06.589 --> 02:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
with inflation adjusted amounts uh then
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
it seems like the appropo to raise this
 
02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
to to 1 million we don't necessarily
 
02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
have to mirror them this by putting a
 
02:03:15.069 --> 02:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
million we're we're just staying at 1
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
million they may change and we'll have
 
02:03:19.069 --> 02:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
to readdress this in another legislature
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
if this if this passes and inflation is
 
02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
much higher but for now this would only
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
do that and it's
 
02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.350 align:start position:0%
do that and it's
only

02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
um actually what sort of assets is does
 
02:03:36.510 --> 02:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
this uh this would
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
be similar to 68 would be uh personal
 
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
property assets so similar like like
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
Machinery um certain types of Motor
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
Vehicles right does not apply to real
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
it's so I can't answer that right
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
sorry yes repres plat though I agree
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
with the sentiment of what you just said
 
02:04:03.629 --> 02:04:03.639 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Janan I'd remove the million
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
dollar limitation said not to instead
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
not to exceed that allowed by the
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue
 
02:04:09.679 --> 02:04:11.350 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue
code

02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
code
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative shamber thank you
 
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a question uh Kean mhm the
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
is there a top limit on the value of the
 
02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.270 align:start position:0%
is there a top limit on the value of the
property

02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:04:27.150 --> 02:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
purchased yes um so
 
02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:28.310 align:start position:0%
purchased yes um so
[Music]

02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
the that amount is not uh fixed on the
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire side so on the it will
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
follow the federal
 
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:39.950 align:start position:0%
follow the federal
amount

02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to clarify so you're saying
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply to real estate is
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying uh no I I
 
02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer that question at at
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
right now I need to double check what
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
did you just say that is uh on the uh
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
the top level of the the uh the I get I
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's the the amount of the cost
 
02:05:03.149 --> 02:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
of the assets that's been acquired and
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
assets um representative spillsbury or
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
anyone else are you familiar as to
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether Section 179 includes real
 
02:05:20.549 --> 02:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
estate no reading the two bills I was
 
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
making that assumption but that I would
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
like that clarified before we're asked
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
it just uh see if we can trying to look
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
well okay I will I'll research that and
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
provide that answer
 
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:46.750 align:start position:0%
provide that answer
okay

02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
um I I know that Keen did email Section
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
179 to us but uh I don't have it with
 
02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
me and it was a long Provisions seven or
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
eight pages it helped me go to sleep
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I had to go to the website and look
 
02:06:03.559 --> 02:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
yeah I had to go to the website and look
something

02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
up maybe we just make it easy and tie it
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
to the federal and be done with it let
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
it float whatever it's going to float at
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
which is basically I think what rep PL
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
said right it's looking to me like you
 
02:06:25.069 --> 02:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
can't actually you cannot actually depre
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
according to this cannot actually
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
depreciate uh actual real property
 
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
rental this is a rental example but
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
rental property uh with Section
 
02:06:37.549 --> 02:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
179 um doesn't depreciate I've never
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
heard of yeah actually I have well no no
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the building the building the
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
building so the building is not
 
02:06:47.069 --> 02:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
depreciable based on this that I just
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
looked up on 179 I've never never heard
 
02:06:52.990 --> 02:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
of um depreciating real estate um not
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
real estate the real estate in the terms
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
of the building itself um on Section
 
02:07:00.910 --> 02:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
179 but um yes Mr Wong if you can get us
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
that answer um possibly um today or by
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning we we might end up
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
executing this uh tomorrow so do do you
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
think you could have that answer by if
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's helpful the uh one of the uh
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
attachments that I emailed out uh this
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
was from the Congressional research
 
02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
service um within that document um it
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
does describe the qualified assets so
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
179 um and to quote that uh
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
document it um let me see
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
here the assets are mostly machinery and
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
equipment used in manufacturing mining
 
02:07:40.159 --> 02:07:42.109 align:start position:0%
equipment used in manufacturing mining
Transportation

02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
Communications uh the generation and
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
transmission of electricity Gas and
 
02:07:50.549 --> 02:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
disposal um that's the uh direct quote
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
from from that document yeah okay so no
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
no mention of actual yeah the real
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
estate itself the building yeah so if I
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
can jump in please yeah uh if we tied
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
this to the FED I wonder what the impact
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
would be you know if it was 1168 today
 
02:08:12.189 --> 02:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
if that wouldn't be too hard to come up
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
with a number it it seems like that
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
would be the most logical way to go just
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
for ease of operation and you know why
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
do we have to keep coming back well it's
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
I know I I I'm kind of torn both ways
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you why um there's
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
probably a reason why Dr or or the state
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislature tied our our current tax
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
code to 2018 probably adjusting every
 
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
single year with all the contortions
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
that go on at the Congressional level
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
these days um that I I'm I'm kind of I
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
think more in favor of just setting it
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
at 1 million right now because you know
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's another thing that um Dr has
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
to track I mean if it starts getting two
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
out of sync then you know it could be
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
addressed again but but I do understand
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
the argument of just tying it to that so
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be addressed um but I
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
don't know do you have any thoughts on
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
on that um I well the the adjustment for
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
inflation is in the uh December 31 tax
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
Cod December 31 2018 tax code um so if
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
we were to remove the the uh the a
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars or the $500,000 uh
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
cap uh we essentially just remove that
 
02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:29.750 align:start position:0%
cap uh we essentially just remove that
that

02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:33.629 --> 02:09:33.639 align:start position:0%
language um at the end of the uh the
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
statute and then it will just follow uh
 
02:09:39.629 --> 02:09:39.639 align:start position:0%
whatever Federal number that is being
 
02:09:44.589 --> 02:09:44.599 align:start position:0%
used um we of obviously we let's say for
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
audit purposes we would have to know
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
what is the the uh the cap for that
 
02:09:52.270 --> 02:09:52.280 align:start position:0%
particular year but uh I believe for
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um I believe it would be a uh
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
much easier task for the tax taxpayer
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
since they're just using the same number
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
for federal side as well to New
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire side um unless of course if
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's some current change to the
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal law that is uh swaying them away
 
02:10:14.669 --> 02:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
from the the 2018 law so let's say if
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's a new law that's being enacted
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
right now federally and changes this
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
deduction um but we would still be using
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
the 2018 law and then so if if that Law
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
changes federally and then if um that
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
Federal inflation number is not
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
available anymore then we would have to
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
figure out what is that infl inflation
 
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
number even the taxpayers would have to
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
figure out what that inflation number is
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
because if that if federal law doesn't
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
provide that anymore so that that would
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
be that complication um having to
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
well yeah so so the interesting thing
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
here is what what you're saying is 2018
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
is a million dollars so if we removed
 
02:10:58.830 --> 02:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
this limit we would still we would be at
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
a million uh no if we remove this limit
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
it will follow uh it would
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
be yeah it would be that 1.16 1.68 no
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
but you said we're following the 2018
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes the
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
2018 incorporates the the language for
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment into it yeah okay
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
no we would still need the accept that
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
property plac in service um because
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's when we want to start to move it
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
amount uh wait a minute I'm I'm not sure
 
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
what you just said yeah and while Dick's
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
mulling that over I would just like
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to simplify taxes for
 
02:11:59.229 --> 02:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
our constituents for their f is I think
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
the way to go I mean the tax code I
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
won't even say what I think about it so
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
you've already know what I think about
 
02:12:08.109 --> 02:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
it so any anything we can do to simplify
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
is good can you uh yeah your um
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
microphone representative got it the um
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
additional point I want to make is that
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
um if once we clarify how we go to this
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
simpler approach I'd like Dr to
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
overnight think
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
about cost and revenue consequences and
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
not just say well we think it's going to
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
be a timing issue I don't think it is
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
for an expense deduction anyway um but
 
02:12:49.229 --> 02:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh i' I'd want to be sure that we're not
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
stepping over the edge of something and
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
we don't really know where we're
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
going you're asking about the revenue
 
02:12:59.950 --> 02:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
impact going from 500 to a million yeah
 
02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
we we would not be able to come up with
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
a with a number on the fiscal impact um
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
however because as this is a
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
depreciation again um claiming
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
that million dollars um Now versus um 5
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so it's still it'll be a it'll be
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
a a timing concern okay the only thing
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
is um as I mentioned earlier if we
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
follow the federal I mean if we
 
02:13:33.069 --> 02:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
follow we if we don't have the million
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollar deduction cap and we say okay to
 
02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
use U the federal number and let's say
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
if current year now there is some
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
federal law or maybe in the future
 
02:13:48.549 --> 02:13:48.559 align:start position:0%
there's some federal law that adjust
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
adjust the 179 deduction and puts it to
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
some some other number we might not have
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
visibility of that um inflation adjusted
 
02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
number that we would rely on on the
 
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
federal side so right now we were we're
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
relying on the federal uh government to
 
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
to publish what is the what is the
 
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
inflated adjusted inflation adjusted
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
number then we're not actually we're not
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:20.830 align:start position:0%
number then we're not actually we're not
necessarily

02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
no forget that okay representative PL I
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
heard you say Mr Wong you do need accept
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
that for property placed in service
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
after January 1st 2025 see so that it's
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
clear when the this takes effect that's
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
correct but we could change not shall
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
calculate expense deductions not to
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
exceed million remove the million and
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
just say that allowed by the Internal
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue code that's
 
02:14:49.709 --> 02:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
correct so you're saying not to exceed
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
that allowed by
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
the we have to say which code the the
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
code that it would be the 2018 code yeah
 
02:14:59.790 --> 02:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
because the whole statute is based on
 
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
2018 code and with respect to
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative or's comments I'd say
 
02:15:07.709 --> 02:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
this is a very taxing dis
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
discussion now in this in this if we
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
were to change this I don't think we'd
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
want to say in the 2018 code we would
 
02:15:17.549 --> 02:15:17.559 align:start position:0%
just say the current IRC adopted by the
 
02:15:17.559 --> 02:15:18.390 align:start position:0%
just say the current IRC adopted by the
state

02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
yeah as of uh as per I think RSA 77- a
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
think 77- a colon I believe it's
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh XX XX XX a Col one
 
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
XX yeah so one is the yes it's
 
02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
definition section Keen your homework is
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
to memorize the tax code come in
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and just you help us out yes
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
sure all right um representative
 
02:15:52.719 --> 02:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
sure all right um representative
spillsbury

02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
yes um K with all of the caveats about
 
02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
estimating Etc but the significance of
 
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
the $4.7 million in the fiscal note is
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
an estimate of what the tax what the
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
revenue impact is
 
02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
Right where's
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
the where are you seeing the 4.7 million
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note it's mentioned at the
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page the end of the second
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph and it's mentioned again uh uh
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
later on the the next paragraph next
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
page okay and again I know there are a
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
lot of caveats but uh isn't that what
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying there that a maximum
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of 4.7 million is what can
 
02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:41.230 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of 4.7 million is what can
be

02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
expected uh that is up to the I believe
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we calculate up to the uh
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
um right under the bill is drafted at 1
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
million right yep and the current tax
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah representative did okay
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so that actually
 
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
was my question also but I'm wondering
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
so is
 
02:17:10.349 --> 02:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
this um $4.7
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
million Revenue lost to the
 
02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
state is that in the first year but it's
 
02:17:19.469 --> 02:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about depreciation so
 
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
aren't we just kind of Shifting it
 
02:17:25.389 --> 02:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
between yes that's correct yep so it'll
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
look like a hit the first year but then
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
we'll it'll be a timing thing yeah okay
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
well right and then then we hope that
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
the you know being more business
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
friendly letting uh companies it would
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
in entice them to invest more and
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
potentially you know create additional
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
business activity so but yeah taxwise
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's a timing issue
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't change I'm just concerned I
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
question that logic question which logic
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
so it it may be true that the timing as
 
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
to the asset placed in service you know
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
in year X becomes neutral over time but
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
what will happen theoretically is that
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
this bill induces new investment each
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
and every year and so that $4.7 million
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
impact is in fact a recurring in impact
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.349 --> 02:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
better um I didn't understand that last
 
02:18:29.790 --> 02:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
part the reoccurring what so so so the
 
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
the the the tax neutrality is a matter
 
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
of deferral on the assets that can claim
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
this advantaged
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
depreciation in this year and that will
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
the estimate is that that will curtail
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
state revenue by 4.7 million but it will
 
02:18:50.509 --> 02:18:50.519 align:start position:0%
occur again next year when more new
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
assets are placed in service and more
 
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
and more of course these
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
depreciation uh allowances are all
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
motivated at least conceptually by the
 
02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
notion that you're going to
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
constantly incentivize new investment
 
02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
and replace equipment more rapidly so it
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
is a constantly recurring thing year to
 
02:19:14.429 --> 02:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
year and and now you're you're buying
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
more of whatever widget from somebody
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
else whose in theory business profits
 
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
tax goes up because they're selling more
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
potentially it's a yeah it's it's a
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
tough to to have it perfectly zeroed in
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative PL I would counter
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
the argument that representative
 
02:19:35.309 --> 02:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
spillsbury just made not not not with
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
factually but uh to say yes but on the
 
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
other hand every year following the
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
investment of that 100 million or
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it is there's uh the the
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
depreciation doesn't occur so the
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
business profits tax goes up uh be
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
because there's no more depreciation
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
stly timing um no matter how often it
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
occurs if I can offer one final counter
 
02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:00.349 align:start position:0%
occurs if I can offer one final counter
observation

02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
observation
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
behaviorally in business what often
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
happens when you allow accelerated
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
depreciation or you have short like
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
threeyear what have you is that
 
02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
businesses will sell their used
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
equipment after it's fully depreciated
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
and the buyer of the used equipment now
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
qualifies to start his own depreciation
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
all over
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
what so just just a Contin continuation
 
02:20:32.670 --> 02:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
of this same discussion so they
 
02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
depreciate the whole amount the first
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
year when they and they sell it in the
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
third year instead of the fifth year so
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
it should be worth more in the third
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
year CU it's not as
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
old so when they sell it that's Revenue
 
02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:51.469 align:start position:0%
old so when they sell it that's Revenue
right

02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
so right it
 
02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
is that's not necessarily Revenue it may
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
be capital gain if they if it went up in
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
value it may be Capital loss if it went
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
down in value and then you get into a
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
very technical technical area where your
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
capital gain or loss is adjusted because
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
of your basis downwards with the
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
depreciation it's I would say the answer
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
to your question is you can't generalize
 
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
to your question is you can't generalize
yeah

02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
and as representative spillsbury said it
 
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
would allow somebody else to buy the
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
equipment depreciate it and that creates
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
more Revenue least somebody else well
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but it keeps the cycle going so I
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
agreed with everything you said except
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
for the word logic there's no logic in
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
any of
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
this repres shamber a question
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
for Kean Kean uh after the 4.7 million
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact that you talk
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
about excuse
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
me the uh you mentioned without taking
 
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
consideration the offset of deductions
 
02:21:59.950 --> 02:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
or credits taken by the taxpayer in the
 
02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
or credits taken by the taxpayer in the
year

02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
analyzed do you see or have you seen in
 
02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
analyzed do you see or have you seen in
the

02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
past companies taken these deductions
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
that would add more than what we're
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the 4.7 million
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
yeah those deductions in credits uh
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
other deductions in other credits not
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
specifically related to to the asset
 
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
itself so in general the business itself
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
taking deductions and credits in in
 
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:32.630 align:start position:0%
taking deductions and credits in in
other

02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
areas yeah
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
represent I think we're at a point where
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's General agreement to change this
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
law uh move from 500,000 I'm a little
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
unclear on whether this consensus is in
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
a million or a million something um if
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
we could
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
clarify what the
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
leading members of this Committee in
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
terms of uh understanding this I think
 
02:23:06.429 --> 02:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
is best and agree to that then uh okay
 
02:23:08.429 --> 02:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
let's let's get done with this and get
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
get an
 
02:23:12.590 --> 02:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
amendment all right so maybe we ask two
 
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions here one would be how many you
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
know like the bill as it is going from
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
500 to a million and just having an
 
02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
500 to a million and just having an
absolute

02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
absolute
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
number and how many would um like to
 
02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to this that lines it
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
with the IRS uh code but we don't know
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what the IRS code is going to do
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
at any any time so so we're g to have
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
we'll have those two questions first one
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
is just pass this as is second is an
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
code well yeah I mean that because that
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
implies that we could just if you vote
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
Yes twice then the idea is that we could
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
just keep this the way it is and not not
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
amend it because it
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
does potentially create more uncertainty
 
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
not knowing where the IRS is moving so
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
all right so first first a poll on how
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
many would just OTP this as is raise
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
Jordan is your
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so all right like 14 to one
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative I no I I I want to I'm a
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
no because I was going for your second
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
question modify it so it follows the IRS
 
02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's okay and that's why I asked the
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
question can you vote Yes twice to help
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
it I don't think that makes sense I mean
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
we've made a choice you well I just yeah
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
how many how many would prefer we amend
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
this and follow the IRS
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
code okay I think it's clear then that
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
we just go with this as is
 
02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you there there might be a
 
02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
third question which is is it ready for
 
02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.710 align:start position:0%
third question which is is it ready for
exec

02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um what what would uh make it
 
02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:09.389 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um what what would uh make it
not

02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:25:11.710 --> 02:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
ready those who still have a question I
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
mean I'm one of those who's ready to
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
pass it the way it is yeah well I mean
 
02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
seeing all the hands off assuming we can
 
02:25:20.110 --> 02:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
we're ready all right I'm going to close
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
the uh work session on HB
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
1536 so we are we are done and that was
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
a lot quicker than I anticipated I
 
02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to go to lunch and
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
come back and uh do that what I would
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
ask is uh we're done for the day right
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're all we're done for the day yeah uh
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
so tomorrow as you probably all know
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
10:00 we will have a work session on the
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
six bills that were listed and we will
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
start our exec session at
 
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
start our exec session at
1:00

02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
1:00
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
um uh tomorrow and uh go from there does
 
02:25:57.550 --> 02:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh anyone have any questions on what
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing or just to make sure um were
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
you thinking we might be able to exec
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
even more
 
02:26:07.710 --> 02:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um yes potentially we could EXA
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
what we talk about in work session
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we don't need more information
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
about correct so there's 14 possible
 
02:26:16.349 --> 02:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
ones I know uh there's already some that
 
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
we won't ex but um yeah we could I think
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's a good plan to do as many as we
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
can thank you exactly yeah um and we'll
 
02:26:26.429 --> 02:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
probably break you know again I don't
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
know I mean today we did uh eight by
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
12:30 I don't know if we can do six by
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know 12 or 11:30 then I'm planning
 
02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
on a lunch break well a lunch break and
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
also maybe a little extra time if the
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
the two parties want to caucus uh
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
briefly um what I'm planning on doing is
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
any Republicans here uh let's um you
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
know take a five minute break and and
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
come back and and just caucus here um on
 
02:27:02.309 --> 02:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
need

02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
up
