so I will open the finance division
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
two uh work session and I think we'll be
 
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
two uh work session and I think we'll be
starting

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
starting
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
with well does anybody else have any
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
comments before I get what we're
 
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 align:start position:0%
starting with
 
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
okay we'll start with HB
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
129 relative to the definition of the
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
term evidence-based within public
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
education and I believe the department
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
up good morning Melissa white division
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
director for learner Support Department
 
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
of Education thank you so I'll open it
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
up to questions from the committee
 
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
do any questions
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
um I come out of an education background
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
from decades and decades ago um and
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk around
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
evidence-based education and you know
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
basically fine you know evidence is a
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
good thing um the question I have here
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
which maybe you can clarify a little bit
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
is that where is the evidence coming
 
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
from from that these things are
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
effective do you you see what I'm saying
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
I mean there's we can with Statistics
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
with everything I can prove anything's
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
effective anything you know there's
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
evidence for everything under the sun
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
especially these days and so can you
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
speak to your criteria of what you
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
consider to be actually evidence-based
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
um educational practices thank you for
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
the question and the proposed
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
legislation they have outlined two items
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
um reproducibility in multiple
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
well-designed studies within a single
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
discipline and then the second one is an
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
independent confirmation by
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
well-designed studies across multi
 
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.110 align:start position:0%
well-designed studies across multi
multiple

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
disciplines it conflicts with the
 
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.949 align:start position:0%
disciplines it conflicts with the
federal

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
definition um the federal definition of
 
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
definition um the federal definition of
evidence-based

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
um is broken up into four different
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
tiers and so when we're looking at
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
evidencebased practices there's tier one
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
which is strong evidence and then tier 2
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
moderate evidence tier three promising
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
evidence and then tier four demon
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrates a rationale logic models
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing and then there's
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
experimental studies that are part of
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
each of those tiers and so it gets
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
um Mo most of the um research that is
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
done and clear National whatw Works
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
Clearing House kind of cataly logs all
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
of those practices all of those
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
curriculums and that type of thing and
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
so often what schools will do is go and
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
look into what works Clearing House to
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
kind of find the the research behind
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
some of these practices some of these
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials and so that becomes
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a challenge idea also
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
has um kind of a separate
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
definition and so this gets a little bit
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
tricky because the evidence-based
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
methods requirement all methods
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
delivering public education shall be
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based including the educator
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
training policies and any pedagogical
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
methods and then it goes into talking
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
about attached or accompanying
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum this gets really challenging
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty restrictive this
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
would mean a complete overhaul of
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
everything that is being taught in a
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
school so this is in addition to some of
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
the laws that we have passed one that
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
comes to mind right off the top of the
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
head is the memorization of times tables
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
and the cursive handwriting requirement
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's no that's not evidence-based
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's out that would be out the current
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh Civics law that we pass for requiring
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
Civics education in the state of New
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's not evidence space we
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
just spent a million dollars on having
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
that curriculum developed for K to 12
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
that would be we'd have to um completely
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
get rid of that um the requirement for
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
the Civics examination where the
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
students have to pass the naturalization
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
test 128 question tests that would be in
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
violation that's not evidence-based so
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
these are just a few examples but when
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
we get into you know suicide prevention
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
training of teachers all of these
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
different things don't meet this very
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
strict definition we do have some uh
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed in regards
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
to um reading instruction and so the
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based requirement for reading
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
instruction for students that are
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
um identified as needing those intensive
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
supports or uh may qualify under the
 
00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:36.030 align:start position:0%
supports or uh may qualify under the
dyslexia

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
dyslexia
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
law that makes sense because it's a very
 
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.350 align:start position:0%
law that makes sense because it's a very
prescribed

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
intervention um some of our programs
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
like title one that talks about
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
delivering specific interventions to
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
those students that are demonstrating
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
they have the most needs for it could be
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
a math or a reading
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
intervention that is evidence-based
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
because you want to ensure that that
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
intervention they're receiving has some
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
sort of um scientific study that's been
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
done to back it up so I think this would
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
substantial impact particularly at the
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
local level to have to redo their
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
entire curriculum to meet the
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and then the department
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
would need a posi at least a position to
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
be able to implement this because this
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
is something that's so Loft
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
to follow through on all the
 
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
out representative hacken Phillips thank
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for that explanation I
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
think it really centers us on uh the
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
challenge uh ahead of us here um if if I
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
am I am acknowledging the local impact
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
um since we know that our local school
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
districts are largely in charge of you
 
00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:05.509 align:start position:0%
districts are largely in charge of you
know

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
implementing um education across the
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
state so I think that's for sure
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledgeable um I'm I'm just
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
wondering about the
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
states um you know the impact to the
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
state so I'm looking at the fiscal
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
note and it states the Department's
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
estimate for this position including
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
salary and other costs is 118,000 for
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 23 for fiscal 27 and 127
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
and fiscal 28 so that would be the
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
potential new position to kind of
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
oversee this at the state level so
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's um that's not appropriated in
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
this bill um at least I'm not seeing it
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering is there is there
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
further impact that the state might feel
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
from possible Federal funding not coming
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
to us because of this definitional
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
change is that something that could I
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
mean you just spoke about a technical
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
conflict in the definition between
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
federal law and state law and then I'm
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if that could impact the like
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
the flow of funding you know for title
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
programs thank you for the question I
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
think I do not think it will have an
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
impact on our federal funding
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
I now that you're saying and I'm
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
thinking trying to think of through on
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
the spot here and I'm pretty sure it
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be I think our federal funding
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
would be okay
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the federal funding that's coming to
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
the state the pass through component of
 
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
it that's where um The Challenge would
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
lie because if you're looking at what
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
some of the schools might or the elas
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
might be um putting into their
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
activities so that they can get
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed I mean we'd have to take a
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:58.519 align:start position:0%
so it's it's possible that we would just
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
have to re R
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
structure how we were ex evaluating the
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
activities they submit to us for um for
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
programs thank you for the question that
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
question represent Murray thank you
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
again so what I hear you saying is that
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
this sounds pretty unworkable or it' be
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
a very heavy lift for the department and
 
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
a very heavy lift for the department and
also

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
um the F the the phys the fiscal demands
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
on local schools uh we don't have any
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
understanding of what that would be and
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
that puts me in mind of Representative
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
lad's Bill about how to um accommodate
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
funds that to to include funds that
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
aren't generally included but um at the
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education level but exist
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
at a local school district level that
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't fit into they don't fall into um
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
our general buckets of funding so you
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
know what you know what I'm talking
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
about you see that there's
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's but he's trying to get away with
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
unreported um funding at local level you
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
know where we say you have to you know
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
teach this class and well there's no
 
00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:10.839 align:start position:0%
Finance Financial impact on this level
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
there is because they have to hire a new
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
teacher and that kind of gets lost in
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
the in The Fray here and it sounds like
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of funding here that would
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
be impact at the local level would have
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
to bring up money in order to do this um
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
but it's money that would not
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily show up on our fiscal
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
notes um thank you for the question I I
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
I think that is
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
correct when you look at different
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
content areas those are not necessarily
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
evidence-based so what consumer
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
economics could be an example of one of
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
them might be taught maybe Arts maybe m
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
i mean there there's certain scientific
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
studies that may be done for music but I
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
mean this would be requiring us to go
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
down this Rabbit Hole of really digging
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
up trying to
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
justify I guess what it is we're doing
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
in schools um the and you're talking
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
about curriculum materials you know
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
books and libraries and that type of
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
questions what do you all want to do you
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
want to get a caucus and figure it out
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
or Mr chair I I just I as members of
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
finance committee are well aware we've
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
got significant challenges running into
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
the budget uh cycle this session and um
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we can
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
justify a new program with this big of a
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
footnote that's not technically
 
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.029 align:start position:0%
footnote that's not technically
appropriated

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm just having a hard time
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
reconciling the big job we have ahead of
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
us of like trying to tighten our belts
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
according to the governor aot's you know
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion and request but at the same
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
time expanding programs for our state so
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time with that I'm not
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
sure if there are other members of the
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
struggle repr papovich thank you Mr
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I would suggest that probably
 
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time you know I'd like
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
to retain it and if we have time to see
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
if some of these concerns can be
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
addressed great if not retaining it will
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
take it off the table because I agree
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
that right now we have bigger fish to
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
fry and I don't want to spend a lot of
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
time right now on this if we can find
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
sometime later on the back end that's
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
great but for now I would suggest
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
retaining do you want to make a motion
 
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.230 align:start position:0%
retaining do you want to make a motion
represent

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
Pap thank you Mr chair I'd like to make
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
129 whenever the clerk is ready just oh
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
yes sorry just for the record this is I
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
want to you know make it clear that I
 
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
cons I'm fine with retaining but I
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
consider this to be an unworkable
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
program and a program that could be
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
incredibly costly and uh given our this
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
session it's it's fine to retain it if
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
you know I would like to see it go away
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is just not a workable program um
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
so I think you know we probably have the
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
votes to retain it um but it is
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
certainly a bill I do not
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
support thank you any other comments
 
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.110 align:start position:0%

Kelly thank you I have real concerns
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
about what this is doing at the local
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
level if we're continuing to downshift
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
some of our costs there and right now
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
the schools are
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
really under pressure for that so I have
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
that concern as
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%

director Jennifer Bailey on the DM uh b
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh to address you this morning uh we
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
we've worked uh I I've had conversations
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor um prior to the bill
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
being um being uh put forth and uh we've
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
gone through it uh Jen did a wonderful
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
job with the um uh the fiscal note on it
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see within the fiscal note
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
um it would be the technology upgrade of
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
$40,000 which uh is included within the
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
bill um but then there would be a
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
full-time position that would um would
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
have to handle the um the correspondence
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
going out and the responses coming back
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
in which in speaking with the sponsor um
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
on during any given election cycle he
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
said we could be looking at uh you know
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
a couple thousand or more of these
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
situations where the DMV would be tasked
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
with mailing uh information out and then
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
trying to uh get information back or
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
proactively inquiring why somebody
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
hasn't um got got a New Hampshire
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
license after they voted with a notate
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
90 days prior um and Jen on the fiscal
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
mode any thoughts you have yeah are did
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
you guys have questions that you were
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
want to start with this or did you just
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
want to hear from us uh either way if
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
you have comments You' like to make go
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
go for it both um so the fiscal note
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
does um so the bill calls for $40,000
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
allocated to us through the bill to for
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
the system updates um I added a position
 
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
needed because talking to our Tech Team
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
although we can work Secretary of State
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
if they were to give us a spreadsheet of
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
the information which would include a
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
person's first name last name their
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
address New Hampshire address plus their
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
out ofate address and their date of
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
birth we could upload that into our
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
system to look for potential matches but
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
there's going to be those cases where
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's not an exact match or if you
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
have a John Smith there could be several
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
matches so there has to be a manual
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
process in there where we're vetting um
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
the responses and then there is no way
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
for our system to just send an notice
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do those notices manually
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so that's where that position comes
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
into play um secondly part of the bill
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
also doesn't only involve voting it also
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
involves just anyone in general not
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
getting a license within 60 days which
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's hard to track um can it be
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
tracked by if they get a ticket in the
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
state or if they registered their
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle yes but that could also add to
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
that position needing to do that
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
research of someone here over 60 days
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
license representative hacken trps
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
thanks so you just spoke about um the
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
need to mail out correspondents and then
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
receive it back so is is the postage
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
estimate included in this uh fisal note
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
either so this is not included in this
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
no no you represented Dy is it possible
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
for this position to be
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
part-time um or temporary it depends I
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
think where we don't know the amount of
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
work we're going to have um they have an
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
estimate of a couple thousand per voting
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
but again we
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
also the real kind of up in the air is
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
this first part of the bill that's just
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
saying in general anyone who's been in
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
the state over 60 days that's going to
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
be more of a research position um so
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
unknown if it could be part-time okay
 
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.630 align:start position:0%
unknown if it could be part-time okay
thank

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
you representative muray thank you very
 
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.430 align:start position:0%
you representative muray thank you very
much

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
um usually when you know we've moved
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
someplace one of the first things we've
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
done is to get our driver's license set
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
up and register to vote and all that
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
stuff um do you you you're in the field
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
here is this a sense that this is a
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
problem because
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
um I hear what the bill is doing I can
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
understand that um it's going to cost
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
the money it sounds like it's going to
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
be cost more money than what's in the
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
bill and you're not entirely sure how
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
much more that's going to cost you also
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't seem to know how heavy a lift this
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
could be in terms of you don't know you
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
you can't anticipate how heavy um a lift
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
it will be how much more work it would
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
be um am I hearing this right is or I
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
guess back to my original question um do
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
you feel that there's a substantial
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
enough problem that we need to address
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
this during this budget cycle so
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative that was a great summary
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I don't think we I don't
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that other than in
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
speaking with the sponsor uh in depth
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
about the bill before it was proposed um
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
you know he's saying that there's uh
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
several thousand that would need
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
correspondents to go out so I think the
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
main focus of the bill is somebody votes
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
with a out ofate driver's license or out
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
ofate St non- driver ID um that's that's
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
where it starts for the 60 days that you
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
have you've established residency at
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
that moment because you voted with the
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
autate ID we can track that it's in the
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
system 60 days goes by you haven't
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
applied for a New Hampshire driver's
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
license the bill gives an additional 30
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that so that triggers the DMV at
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
the 90-day Mark to then do something to
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
then reach out and inquire and we did
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
have conversations I I spoke with the
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor about is that really the DMV
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
role um because at the end of the day
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
um you may have somebody that uh lived
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
here for a period of time uh and then
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
moved back to the state that they came
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
from you may have somebody that uh
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
stopped driving and didn't apply for a
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license because
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't want one um or they didn't
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
want a non-driver ID or need
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
oneing and so so now you have a
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
situation where we're reaching out to
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
people through the DMV to say hey we
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
noticed that you didn't get a New
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license and you have
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
been here for over 60 days why not and I
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
did Express to the sponsor I'm not so
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
sure that that's our role I don't know
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing that so as far
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
as the scope of the problem with regards
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
to voting I don't know enough about that
 
00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919 align:start position:0%
um but with regards to what what is the
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
end goal because I did ask that question
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
what so now we send the Corp
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
correspondents out and nobody gets back
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
to us there no consequence what what
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
happens there what happens there is
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
nothing um and so I did ask towards the
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
end of the conversation is this more if
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
we don't get the compliance with the
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
person that we've reached out to um is
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
this more of a
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
research program here are we are we
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
trying to keep track of information and
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
and identify patterns that can be used
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the future and the answer to that was
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
yes I mean there there would have to be
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
a phase two of this bill at one point
 
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
because there were no teeth to it in the
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
end so basically if if we send something
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
out and they don't respond that's
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
essentially where it ends
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
so represent papovich thank you and I
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate you guys being here thank you
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for being here to
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
testify you were mentioning a couple of
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
other interactions other than voting
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
right registering a vehicle or
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
potentially you know getting a ticket
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
even though with a ticket I could be
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
from out of state so you know if you
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
ticket somebody who's got an out of
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
state license I'm not sure how that
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
would fall into this but my question is
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
would there be any other interactions
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
where you know somebody using an outof
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
state license could indicate that they
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
have moved in in and therefore the
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
60-day time starts because obviously
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
register a vehicle de giveaway right
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
voting obviously you just said you live
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
here same thing for registering a
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle tickets I'm not so sure so I'm
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand is there
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
anything else in terms of interactions
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
that you could think of starting a clear
 
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
clock on that's a I can I can speak to
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a wonderful question
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative and one that we get often
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
um there isn't uh there isn't so so
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
really what what you rely on is a
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
situation where uh law enforcement has
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
contact with an individual and the
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
license uh is handed and um it's an out
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
of state license and the question is
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
asked oh how long have you lived in New
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um you're you're really basing
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
it on the response that you're getting
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
from the person um there's not enough
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
time to go back and do a review of their
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
permanent address and how long they've
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
been there or you could have a scenario
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
where a neighbor uh notifies law
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement and says I see that this
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
person has a an out estate license plate
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
they've been parked in the driveway
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
there for six months um I I I don't
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
think they're a New Hampshire resident
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
or or they they should be a New
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident because of the amount
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
of time that would trigger uh an
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
investigation that would be something
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
that you could look into but it's a gray
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
area the 60 days where the clock starts
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
is very gray and that's why this bill
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
one thing it does do is when you
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
presented the identification at time of
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
voting that does start the clock the
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
clock because at that point you've
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
you've identified yourself through uh an
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
outstate ID thank you quick
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so just as a quick
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
followup the one thing that I can think
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
of would be you know lease contracts and
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
whatnot but I would not support any
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
attempt to go through that in order to
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
enforce this so that one it's a private
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
contract between two people I don't want
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have a you know involvement but that
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
was the only other you know possible
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
place to get this but again I I I don't
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
think that it would be worth the effort
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
policy wise the Privacy violations and
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
whatnot would be uh not worth the uh
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
benefits here so I think I'm good thank
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
you representative I just could I just
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
add to that for one moment that that's a
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
great point because at the DMV we
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
receive information we receive
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
documentation and I think what's
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
different about this bill is uh yes we
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
do send out notices to let people know
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
that your your license renewal is coming
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
up um you know your medical card is
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
going to expire we do communicate we
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
send out over a million pieces of
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
Correspondence every year to communicate
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the difference here is to your point
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to um identifying your
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
address your residency uh we count on
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities around the state to
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
do that uh for registration purposes we
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
do it at the DMVs for licensing purposes
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
but this one here is almost again maybe
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
going beyond the scope because you're
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
reaching out proactively to say we notic
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
that you haven't received a license yet
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
and you've been here long enough to get
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
one please respond as to why I just I
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
just don't know that that's a a Division
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles role to be doing that
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
because a license is a privilege and you
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to get one if you choose not
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
to represent pap
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
just one followup which I didn't
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
originally plan but you what you were
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying brought it up can you clarify for
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
us because this is your area of
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
expertise uh if you know why do we even
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
require people to have a New Hampshire
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license when they move
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
in well if it doesn't really matter that
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
much because they already have the light
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
right to drive from wherever State they
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
come in why do we have this so it's a
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I I can speak to um
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's in statute um that
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know statute identifies the fact
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the 60-day mark you have to get the
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire license that being said um
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know you you bring up a great point
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
on um that gray area really uh somebody
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's here as a visitor um that's not
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
going to be here for the full 60 days uh
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
maybe driving with a an international
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
driver's license which is a translation
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
document for your home country driver's
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
license um agricultural visas uh you can
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
drive and that's in law um but you can
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
drive on your home country license for
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
certain visas um for uh up to 300 days
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
um so there are exceptions to it uh I
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the original Law the 60
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
days where it came from and but I we
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
just follow it but that's a great
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
representative hacka Phillips thank you
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you I just heard you
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
say that licenses are a privilege um
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
which triggered in my mind the idea that
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
voting is a fundamental right of our you
 
00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:02.029 align:start position:0%
voting is a fundamental right of our you
know

00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
Civic um responsibilities and rights as
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
Americans so I'm a little I'm drawing
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
connections now that make me really
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable so the way I read the law
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
proposed law here is that it would
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
require voters to purchase a driver's
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
license even if they don't drive as an
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
obligation tied to voting so my question
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
now is that is that a reverse pole tax
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
are we talking about charging New
 
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.190 align:start position:0%
are we talking about charging New
Hampshire

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
citizens for something they may not even
 
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
use or need as as it's correlated to
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
their right to vote this this seems this
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
seems like uh tying a fiscal obligation
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
to voter to voting is what it sounds
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
like to me and if that's the case that I
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
have real concerns about its
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionality at this point so um I
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not in favor of what we're doing
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
represent papovich thank you and um I
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
would appreciate if uh you would clarify
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that we do not
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
require people to have driver's
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
licenses we just need a form of ID
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
driver licens is being one of them but
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
does the DMV issue non-driver ID and is
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
there a mechanism through which people
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
who cannot afford to pay the few dollars
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
at C can get it for
 
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
free so we do issue an option of a
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
non-driver ID card it's $10 fee um there
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
is not an option to not pay for that um
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
however we do per statute I believe back
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the early
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
2000s um we have a voter identification
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
card um that is free of charge you get
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
that a voucher through your town clerk
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you're eligible for if you um don't
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a license or ID card in the state
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
um you're eligible for that document
 
00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:02.670 align:start position:0%
um you're eligible for that document
thank

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
you representative P PHS is a followup
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
to that question um is there any
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that would suggest
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
that the voter ID cards would be uh like
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
an exemption to the rule or there is not
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
possibility and the voter ID the way
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's written into statute is that you
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't have um a you don't have the
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
ability to obtain a license so you don't
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
already currently have an out of state
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
license you don't already currently have
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire ID card it's
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
for those that may I would say most
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
commonly we've seen issued that they've
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
been in nursing homes for years they
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
don't have their original documents and
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
they want to vote they can get that
 
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.150 align:start position:0%
they want to vote they can get that
voter

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
voter
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
identification representative Kelly as a
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
followup to that does the voter ID card
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
have a photo of the person it does it
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
has very it only puts their photo their
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
name um address and date of birth
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
it other
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions I I have one so if the
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety isn't the one to
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
follow up what department would be more
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate well um that's a good
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
question you know we did I did speak
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor about that too sir I
 
00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:21.870 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor about that too sir I
mean

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
it we do send information to the
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office for new
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
residents to the state that get a New
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire credential and they're they're
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
made aware of that for purposes of the
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
towns and voting um but to have it come
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
the other way um so that we can send out
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
correspondents to try to um identify
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
status I mean that's really what you're
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
talking about here right you're you're
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
trying to identify a person's current
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
status 90 days after they went in and
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
voted I I I don't think we are the
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
agency that should be identifying status
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
we do it when somebody wants something
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
like a credential and they bring uh
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
their information to us the document
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
documentation to us and we have to
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
validate status to give you that
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
credential but in this one here it's
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
really it has nothing to do with the DMV
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
but yet we're reaching out to you to
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
identify your status 90 days after you
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
voted which to your question sir would
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
appear to me to reside with Secretary of
 
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.829 align:start position:0%
appear to me to reside with Secretary of
State's

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
State's
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
office so we have a law which you
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
referred to which I think you indicated
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
required a person to get a driver's
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
license Within 60 days and the last I
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
checked the DMV is responsible for
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
issuing driver's licenses I guess I'm a
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
little confused as to why it wouldn't be
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
natural for the Department of Safety to
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
up um I think I guess my thought on that
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
would be the the ACT that's taking place
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
like the Attorney General's office if
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
somebody uh believes that that there's
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
been voter fraud if if somebody believes
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
that somebody voted that shouldn't have
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that gets sent to uh
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office for review
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
um so there's a mechanism for that so in
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
this particular case we're talking about
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
somebody voting and showing an out ofate
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
license which we have nothing to do with
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh but they show the out ofate license
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
to do a certain thing which in this case
 
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.710 align:start position:0%
to do a certain thing which in this case
is

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
voting we don't know if somebody went
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
and voted we don't get involved with
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
that that's not our scope we we we issue
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
credentials but yet from that
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
transaction now it's coming back to the
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
DMV through uh another state agency that
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office coming
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
back to us to sayate this person did
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
this particular thing which is outside
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
the realm of what you do but we would
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
like you on our behalf to reach out to
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
this individual through correspondence
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
or put a link on the website to this
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
individual to get an update on their
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
status so that it appears to me so that
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
we can report that back to them right
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
report that back to them so it it
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
appears to me that the DMV is is playing
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
the middleman here and I just don't know
 
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.510 align:start position:0%
the middleman here and I just don't know
um

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
how operationally that that works so I
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that it resides with us
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't do that for I'll
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
give you another example we get calls
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
all the time for um businesses scanning
 
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.950 align:start position:0%
all the time for um businesses scanning
somebody's

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
license somebody scammed my license I've
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
read 2614 driver Privacy Act my rights
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
have been violated I want that person or
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
business uh investigated and I want an
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
arrest made we we get those calls um so
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
but but we don't we don't at that point
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to the business uh we don't do
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
an investigation we don't do it you
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
somebody has used the license for a
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
purpose that a citizen believes or
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
resident believes was inappropriate
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's a referral but we don't we
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't get asked to send out
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
correspondents to pick a business to say
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
hey we understand that you're doing this
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
why did you do that you have X number of
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
days to report back to us on your
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
practices we don't do that and so I I
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
think that that's why I say it's beyond
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
the scope we issue licenses we issue
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
titles uh we clear defaults and and
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
suspensions uh we work with the towns
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
and cities to issue registrations we
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
don't do
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
the the behindth work investigative work
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
that it appears that this bill is
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat asking us to do and just to add
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
to that so the initial bill about the 60
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
days this is the actual RSA the 26335
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
this first part of the bill is the
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
original Bill they're adding this voting
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
part to it um do I think that the other
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
means we talked about that if we were
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
told that they're um they had registered
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
a vehicle for like last year and now
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to renew and they haven't
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
gotten a New Hampshire license yet do I
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
think that's in our scope that's in our
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
scope I believe because we register
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles that so I think that's where we
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
would that part of the original Law we
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
would reach out to those people that you
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
haven't transferred but again the Voting
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
is adding an additional to us where
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
we're not engaged in any part of voting
 
00:41:56.119 --> 00:41:58.069 align:start position:0%
we're not engaged in any part of voting
otherwise

00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
well if I could just add to that too so
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
so with with that situation again the
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
the DMV though in in being go back to
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
the scenario that I offered before where
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
a neighbor calls in and says I think
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
that uh somebody's been here for six
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
months with a an notate plate and I
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
don't think they're they've established
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
residency and I think they should um we
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
we don't we we don't investigate that we
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
we don't investigate that that goes to
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
the state police and the state police a
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
separate division within the department
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
of safety would do that investigation
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
but the dmbb we don't we don't do that
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
that repres papich thank you just a
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
quick clarification because you know I'm
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
learning a lot um when I think
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
investigation I think of way more than
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
sending a letter and then basically
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
saying I guess nobody answered right so
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
understand since you guys are the
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
keepers of the drivers licenses right if
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
all we are asking to do is not a
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
full-blown investigation just a request
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
hey you may not be aware of this law
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
that requires you to 60 days now we
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
noticed you've been here more than 60
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
days and we know that because of again
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle regist it doesn't even matter
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's voting or registering a
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle we are aware that you've been
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
here for more than six days you may want
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
to consider right obeying the law and
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
getting your license right is that that
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
much of a burden
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to understand I hear
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
your concerns if you would be asked to
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
send investigator and talk to people and
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
interview the neighbors but we're
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the letter and then either
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
you get a response or you don't that's a
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
great question representative if I may
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
start with it and certainly uh assistant
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
director Bailey Can can add to it um I
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
guess my my thought on that would be
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
again I see the DMV and I've expressed
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
this to the sponsor um you know we we've
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
had a great conversation regarding the
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill but I I see the the DMV sending out
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
the letter no that's not cumbersome for
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
us uh you know we like I said we send
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
out over a million pieces of
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
Correspondence every year for reminders
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
for um You' you've got your license 3
 
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
roughly 880,000 uh times a year um I
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
think I think the difference here is
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're sending that we're sending
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
that document out to check on to let you
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
know that we know that you didn't get a
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh put it this way if somebody that goes
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
and votes and uses an out ofate ID and
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
goes about their business and their life
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then they decide you know what I'm
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
not going to renew my driver's license
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
and it happens to expire within 60 days
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
after voting this law says that the
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
90-day Mark you got to trigger the DMV
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
and we've got to send out that
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
correspondant I I don't know I could
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
Envision people opening their mail and
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
and seeing wow the DMV logo is on here
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
the DMV is asking me why I didn't get a
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire why is the DMV
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
and this has and then they make a phone
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
call and they find out well why did I
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
get mailed this letter you get mailed
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
the letter because you're voted with an
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
out state ID I think people are going to
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
start to ask the question why is the DMV
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
following up on my voting record and I
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
guess that's a little bit of a concern
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
that I have I think that that letter is
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
not cumbersome but I think the letter
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
probably should come from the Secretary
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
of State's office you're right we have
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
the data if you want the data and you
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
query us to provide in law you the data
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
for who hasn't gotten the license in the
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
90 days we'll give you that information
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
but I say you send the letter out
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
because this whole things about voting
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
you didn't get the license it's a
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
residency thing I get it and it's a
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
driver license thing I get it but I
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
think that letter should come from
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office so the
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
person opening the mail can put two and
 
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.150 align:start position:0%
person opening the mail can put two and
two

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
together representative Murray thank you
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think the government should
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
be the neighborhood Busy Body in
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
tracking down some of that things and I
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
just want to refer to page two lines
 
00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:52.559 align:start position:0%
seven and8 well 6 s and 8 and you can
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
correct me if I misread Secretary of
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
State shall authorize release of
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
information for the database necessary
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Safety to notify
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
an individual pursuant to na na na I
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
just don't see that that's anywhere in
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
the department of safety's purview um
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's not part of their mission it seems
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
to me that's part of the Secretary of
 
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.670 align:start position:0%
to me that's part of the Secretary of
State's

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
Mission represent hacka Phillips thank
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%

00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
person who previously drove and worked
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
in another state could move to New
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for you know assisted living
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
or you know permanent retirement and
 
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
determine that you know they never need
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
to drive again so they wouldn't need a
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
driver's license so even if we're
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the first section of the
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
bill um for a non-resident who
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
establishes residency in the
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
state I'm having a hard time
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
understanding why the state would have
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
an interest in demanding that an elderly
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
person retiring here in New Hampshire
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
who doesn't drive is required to have a
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
driver's license so um again comes with
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
a fiscal you know obligation for these
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
folks who probably are limited income so
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
again I don't understand why they would
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
be charged to live in the state of New
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I again I think that
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that this bill
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
needs um to be successful I think the
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
intention is just not um really carried
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
out completely with the details and
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
again I if I could just Express to the
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
committee the um you know real concern I
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
think at the back of the fiscal note
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
here there's several POS unfunded years
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
of positions here that are not
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the bill and if I
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
reflect upon my earlier statement on the
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
previous bill you
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
know how can we justify adding a new
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
program to our state when we know that
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
there's some serious and significant
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
cuts that we need to do as a as a budget
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee so I just again um I think
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
while this bill comes a little closer to
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
being um thought through it's still a
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
lot of work needs to be done I
 
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time would you believe
 
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.230 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time would you believe
that's

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
true hold on could you just clarify
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
where you referring to on page
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
one is it is it section c on line 14 uh
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
section page so page one of language I'm
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
looking at lines you know one through
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
nine um oh the part this current law non
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
residents who establish residencies in
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
the state well that's current law though
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah but as you go down as
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
you go down the B subsection B and C I
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
mean it's requiring people to get
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses here in the state but
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't are we requiring every
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
resident in the city of New Hampshire to
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.150 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um did you have AES represent
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
Murray yeah um if it's appropriate and
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
if it's not I can hold off um but given
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
that I find this again as an unworkable
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
program I think it's dealing with the
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
wrong agency I'm not sure that it's a
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
significant problem or that it's the
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
department of safety's problem and that
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
it's a new budget and going to be a
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
really really tough year there are no
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions for the voter ID cards as far
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
as we can tell with what we're reading
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
and that um it does seem to have
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
identified costs since we don't know
 
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
what the lift would be I would propose
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
an itl on this
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
Right Rob papovich if I may just I had
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
one last question um who's currently
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcing
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
26335 as current
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
law 633 yeah the the whole non resident
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
who establishes a residency in the state
 
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
who establishes a residency in the state
oh

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
um well I can say from a from a DMV
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint um we don't we don't get
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
involved with that we don't follow up on
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't proactively reach out to
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
identify how long somebody's been in in
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
the state unless not proactively but
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
when you get you know the information
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
again somebody registers a car law
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay but at at this point in
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
time when you guys become aware that
 
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
somebody has an outof state
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
license you know and then 60 days later
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
they still don't have a license in your
 
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.150 align:start position:0%
they still don't have a license in your
system

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
what is the current process that you
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
follow well well if I could on that
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
ticket yeah so so the if you have that
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
Nexus with law enforcement and it's
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
identified that the license that's being
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
given is out of state um and the
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
person's been here for over this 60 days
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
then that that is a that's a uh
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
ticketable offense so there'd be
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement action there that would
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
require that individual um potentially
 
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
to appear in court so there's there's
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
that Nexus um when we talk about
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
registration ation the example I used
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
earlier again if if we were to be made
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
not made aware of the fact that somebody
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
probably has been in New Hampshire
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
Beyond um you know the 60-day mark and
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
therefore should be claiming residency
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
then what we would we would do is we
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
would refer that to law enforcement who
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
would then they would do an
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
investigation maybe do an interview or
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
two and prepare a report um that would
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
then either there would be um law
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement action taken or um you could
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
have a situation where administrative
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
action is requested by the DMB on behalf
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement but we would have
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
them do that we would ask them to do
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
that on our behalf and it's a clarifying
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
question go ahead I do have one more
 
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
also when you're registering a vehicle
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
most towns most towns require you to
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
have a New Hampshire license for your
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
register those that will register with
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
an ad ofate if you go back the following
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
year to renew they will stop you at
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
renewal time and won't allow you to
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
renew until you OB that's one year not
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
60 days right and and again I'm just
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the current process
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
right because at the end of the day when
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
you talk about changing it it kind of
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
behooves you to understand what the
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
current process
 
00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:07.150 align:start position:0%
current process
is

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
so car registrations which are you know
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
again processed by the dmbb at the end
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
day most Town clerks won't let you do it
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
without a driver's license I find that a
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
bit surprising because they seem to
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
exceed state law but I'm not going to
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
get into that particular with uh
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
patch but if it's register you know when
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
you register it and you have an out
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
ofate driver's license you would be
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
immediately aware of that right and then
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
you it's just a matter of the 60 days do
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
you proactively look at that and say 60
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
days later I'm going to go look at these
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
people who we were aware at the time you
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
know they started the clock and now I
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to bring it to the
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
attention of whoever enforces it or is
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
that something that you don't do right
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
now that's an excellent question
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative excellent question we
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't okay we don't we don't track it we
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't do that um ultimately what happens
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
we essentially defer to law enforcement
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
we defer to law enforcement for when
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
they identify those scenarios um to
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
either take enforcement action do an
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
investigation and like I said maybe
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
notify us administratively of action
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
they would like us to take because they
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
have completed an investigation it's a
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question the
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
60-day um residency piece is one that
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
comes up a lot and it's uh there is
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
there is a gray area to it I mean
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's a gray area to um we hope
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
everybody does it when they've been here
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
for 60 days um and if they don't then
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
they're running a risk of having contact
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement um and maybe law
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement's able to figure that out
 
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
you that that time representative
 
00:53:52.799 --> 00:53:54.549 align:start position:0%
you that that time representative

00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
um instead of this but yeah I do have
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
the I did propose the itl um going
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
forward instead of something like this
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
um would it be helpful to you if the
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
legislature addressed this gray area
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to or or is that
 
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
just kind of a
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
meh I I think it's a wonderful question
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
I I don't have the answer to it I I
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know it's it's
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
definitely it's definitely one that it
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
would be nice if there were if it was
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
more clear
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
in how that could be enforced on the
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
60-day um but I let me give it some
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
thought and talk to some other people
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
and maybe I could get something back to
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you representative
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%

representative papovich just the
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement given that we are still
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
looking at potentially trying to work on
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
this I would make a motion to retain

it being uh
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
105 we'll open the work session of
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
finance division
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
2 and we'll start with uh Mr landan from
 
02:34:17.070 --> 02:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
the LBA for presentation um thoughts
 
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
about how the next six or seven or
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
whatever it is weeks are going to
 
02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
go and is it all right if we just
 
02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
interrupt you with questions in the
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
process so of course everybody please
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
feel free to um you know jump in one of
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
the goals in addition to him going over
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of things is also for us to agree
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
on how we want to go about um working
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
with the with the Departments as they as
 
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
they come in so that we're on the same
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
page as far as that goes as I understand
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
it'll be a little bit different than um
 
02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past how's that we
 
02:34:51.070 --> 02:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
we'll get to it okay
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
Mickey will bring us
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
there all right good afternoon folks um
 
02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
so before we get started I just want to
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone has a lot of the
 
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
documents I at least want to point us
 
02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
through today so last week you got the
 
02:35:04.590 --> 02:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
big budget document the governor's
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
recommended budget I see a couple of
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
those out there so you've got those um
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's also very user friendly in a PDF
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
form for searching and if you prefer
 
02:35:16.510 --> 02:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
that method uh as well as the um
 
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget executive summary has
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
some useful information and there I'll
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
kind of point us to a couple of things
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
um and then the trailer Bill document
 
02:35:26.429 --> 02:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
which I think everyone has a copy of
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
that now and we'll kind of go over that
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
as well and I'll point you to the
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
sections that'll likely be referred to
 
02:35:35.070 --> 02:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
division two um for
 
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
review I also handed out a clipped
 
02:35:41.389 --> 02:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
packet of papers um and we'll get to
 
02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
these two one um is just a summary of
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
the total Appropriations by source of
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
funds for each of the agencies in
 
02:35:51.790 --> 02:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
division 2 as well as an education trust
 
02:35:53.750 --> 02:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund Highway fund and fishing game fund
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement you know SL SN uh
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
snapshot of the governor's recommended
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
budget and I've I've built a column for
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
division 2's starting point essentially
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
which takes into consideration the house
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee adopted
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
revenues so that's what I just want to
 
02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
at least just go over uh these documents
 
02:36:17.790 --> 02:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
today does everyone have those I think
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh did you get one that was the one this
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
morning I think you had on your table is
 
02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
right yep that that's the trailer bill
 
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh so trailer bill is the uh
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
nickname for what will eventually be
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 when it's introduced um
 
02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is not the official introduced
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
version this is the governor's draft OS
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
is working on getting an official house
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.920 --> 02:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
right so I guess uh first thing um we
 
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
talked about before we get into some of
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
these details um what representative
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
Earth was talking about as far as
 
02:37:12.429 --> 02:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
process maybe we touch on that first um
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the past um division 2 has had the
 
02:37:20.269 --> 02:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
agencies come in heard a a presentation
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
and kind of moved on from there uh prior
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
to that and I know some other divisions
 
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
have done this where you've actually
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
gone through and flipped the pages I
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
don't think we've done that in division
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
two the last term or two but that's
 
02:37:32.670 --> 02:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
something representative Earth was
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
considering doing this year I think the
 
02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
agencies are on board with so that'll
 
02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
make it important for you to have your
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
big budget with you or uh your PDF when
 
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
the agencies come in they'll be prepared
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
to start on page one of their budget
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
flip pages um our agencies have a lot of
 
02:37:53.710 --> 02:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
accounting units that are federal other
 
02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
funds um that you probably are not going
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
to want to spend a ton of time on as
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
your flipping certainly reasonable to
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
ask the agency oh what's that grant for
 
02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:03.349 align:start position:0%
ask the agency oh what's that grant for
um

02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
but understanding you only have so much
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
time in this process you probably aren't
 
02:38:09.150 --> 02:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
going to want to spend a ton of time on
 
02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
the non General Highway education trust
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
fund accounts so I think that is that
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
the big change you were kind of talking
 
02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
about yes and I would like to get your
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
feed back in terms of that approach and
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could also bring up some
 
02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
example pages of like one that has
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds only for instance and one
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
that has a mixture so people can
 
02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
understand what it is we're looking at
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
and and what ones maybe we can just skip
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
over more rapidly but I'm glad to take
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions first if you prefer I I am
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
totally down with that I actually missed
 
02:38:40.349 --> 02:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
going line by line the past I I just
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
thought it was kind of egregious I
 
02:38:46.269 --> 02:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
thought that it was um not what is the
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
word I want it was not a very
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
professional thing to do not to go line
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
by line so I'm really and I think my
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
first two sessions by and large we went
 
02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
line by line and um I am totally totally
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of that it is what I am doing
 
02:39:01.230 --> 02:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
at my kitchen table at home I'm so glad
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
to hear that because that's what
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
division three did representative Kelly
 
02:39:06.750 --> 02:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm used to so I didn't I
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
missed this little change that happened
 
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
and does it make sense to you what we're
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay is perfect okay well that's great
 
02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
that was easy so maybe you just show us
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
for especially for the new people um
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
a couple sample pages to get an idea of
 
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
about the whole GFF thing that gives so
 
02:39:25.389 --> 02:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
we understand how where we can move more
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
rapidly through um because there are a
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
lot of pages to
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
flip so I can point you to one right now
 
02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
because I've got one here if you've got
 
02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
your document handy so on the big uh
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
document if we go to page
 
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
382 and this would be 382 and this would
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
382 I guess if you've got Adobe or
 
02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
whatever you're yeah it's the it's
 
02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
actually the PDF page number so it's
 
02:40:08.349 --> 02:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
it's or the printed page number is 383
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's actually the document page number
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
396 in the PDF uh Adobe but what's
 
02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
printed at the top of the page should be
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
383 yeah it it's 382 and then goes on to
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
no yeah so our office would have seen
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
these for the first time when you did on
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
are you all set represent Kelly got your
 
02:41:25.469 --> 02:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
paper it's much easier okay you're all
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
set as well okay we're good so on the
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of 382 you see accounting unit
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
5046 recreational boat safety Grant and
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
this continues on to the next page and
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
you see halfway through the page the
 
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
estimated source for funds is federal
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
funds so this entire accounting unit is
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
federally funded so this would be a good
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
example when you get to an account like
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
this certainly the department maybe in a
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
sentence or two can hopefully briefly
 
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
explain what that Grant's for and how
 
02:41:59.150 --> 02:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
it's used um but making a reduction
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
Herer cutting is not going to help your
 
02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
general fund story in any way um but
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
certainly it's it's all still authorized
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
spending it's still within the purview
 
02:42:08.750 --> 02:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
of this committee to decide what you
 
02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
want to fund it at but as far as in the
 
02:42:13.309 --> 02:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh effort of Saving Time and everything
 
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
you may not want to spend a whole lot of
 
02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
time there uh yeah absolutely um yeah I
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
mean going back on the de still remember
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
the blinding Turtles I'll never forget
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
the blending Turtles when there was a f
 
02:42:27.389 --> 02:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
thing but uh sometime one of the things
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
that confuses me is when something gets
 
02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
moved from one place to another so
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
you've got all these zeros here and it
 
02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
looks like the or you know you have
 
02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
zeros and then there's money or there's
 
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
money and then it's all zeros and trying
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
to keep track of when something is
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
actually coming or going and when
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
something has been switched someplace
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
else it takes me a while to try to sort
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
out which it is so any direction there
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
can be
 
02:42:53.790 --> 02:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah and that's something we'll
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
rely on the agencies for so as you're
 
02:42:56.670 --> 02:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
flipping and you see one of those
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
examples and I'll actually get to one I
 
02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
can show you one here soon um we'll have
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
to ask the agency oh maybe these aren't
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
seven new positions maybe they were
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and now they're just
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
creating a new accounting unit splitting
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
it out and and and a lot of that we'll
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
we'll rely on the agencies for the
 
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
detail repres Dy are you on this page
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
regarding federal funds does that make
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
sense to you if there were multiple
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms it would be fed
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
Federal General other that kind of thing
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
would be listed down there and if we
 
02:43:26.190 --> 02:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
continue before we get to that um uh
 
02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
regarding what you just said oh gez um
 
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
things getting moved things get moved
 
02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
around yeah one big thing you're going
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
to see is where the
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
education accounts used to all be in one
 
02:43:44.429 --> 02:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
account they're now going to be
 
02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
separated into individual accounts so
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
that's a huge change that's going to
 
02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
show up just the way
 
02:43:52.590 --> 02:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
describing yeah that's a good example
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that's right at the end of the
 
02:43:55.469 --> 02:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
Department of education's budget we can
 
02:43:56.990 --> 02:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
we can uh go through that later too if
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
you'd like but if you flip to page 385
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
so a couple Pages later this is the
 
02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:05.349 align:start position:0%
so a couple Pages later this is the
detective

02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau and we uh we heard the governor
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
talk about some changes to the detective
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh so this is an example if you
 
02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
look at the bottom it's General funds
 
02:44:16.269 --> 02:44:16.279 align:start position:0%
but then there's some agency income in
 
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
here so we would want to ask the
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
department some details on what that
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
agency income is but you can see General
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
funds for this account so this would be
 
02:44:25.389 --> 02:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
an area you'd want to understand oh
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're going from 68 positions to 77
 
02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
positions what's going on here so this
 
02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
is a good account to ask the department
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
for just to understand what's going on
 
02:44:39.710 --> 02:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and then and this is also one was I
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
found it interesting to ask so what does
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
agency income mean y um safety and
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
others of the account that we're looking
 
02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
at have a lot of dedicated funds that um
 
02:44:51.630 --> 02:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
it might be worth exploring whether we
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
want to keep them as dedicated funds or
 
02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
take a different approach but in any
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
case this is one of
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
them yes yep uh and then if you go to
 
02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
page 415 I think it could be PDF page
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
428 represent Murray but it's accounting
 
02:45:06.319 --> 02:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
428 represent Murray but it's accounting
unit

02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
are you there okay so this is an example
 
02:45:35.469 --> 02:45:35.479 align:start position:0%
of there's nothing for 24 and 25 but we
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
see nine positions and a full accounting
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the trailer Bill we see that um
 
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
the electri electric uh inspectors and I
 
02:45:45.870 --> 02:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to misquote it but there's
 
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
some mechanical safety inspectors looks
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
like there's proposal to move them from
 
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
oplc Back to the Department of Safety
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
this used to be a function under the
 
02:45:55.630 --> 02:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
fire safety uh division so not only from
 
02:45:57.070 --> 02:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
different accounts but from different
 
02:45:59.469 --> 02:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
divisions right so when uh I know
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
division one should hopefully be asking
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
about this when they have oplc in we'll
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
ask safety about it when when they come
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
in just to get an understanding of this
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
looks like a big change just need to
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
here does that make sense absolutely go
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
ahead why why would they do
 
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
so that so this this would be something
 
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
to ask the department about there could
 
02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
be a policy reason why they would feel
 
02:46:29.469 --> 02:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety's division
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
of fire safety is more suited to do this
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
work than the office of professional
 
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
licensure and that's why the the move
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
was uh proposed here so you'll you'll
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
hear from them the um the intent behind
 
02:46:44.349 --> 02:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:47.469 --> 02:46:47.479 align:start position:0%
okay so that's just I think hopefully
 
02:46:49.630 --> 02:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's comfortable with this you'll
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
you'll become experts when the budget
 
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
session's over and then not look at it
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
again for two years that's usually how
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
it works so just while we're here to
 
02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
reiterate every account at the end shows
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
the number of positions of the various
 
02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
types and that's also very important to
 
02:47:04.590 --> 02:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
look at to see are they incre and here
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
you're seeing a big jump which is not
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually real because it's shifting from
 
02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
a different place but like the one that
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
Mr L just showed us where it was it
 
02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
actually was going up they added about
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
nine new detectives and that was the
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
governor's you may remember her talking
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
about um clo um
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
not closed cases cold cases um that's
 
02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's why that's that's why
 
02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's what's going on there and
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
one thing as far as the position counts
 
02:47:32.349 --> 02:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
go that calculates the total uh funded
 
02:47:34.910 --> 02:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
permanent CL or not funded the total
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
permanent classified unclassified
 
02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
positions not necessarily funded ones so
 
02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
that accounting unit has nine positions
 
02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
in there we'll have to rely on the
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
department to tell us of those nine how
 
02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
many are funded because we can have
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded authorized positions in state
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
government we have many of them and and
 
02:47:53.469 --> 02:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
how many are vacant and and either
 
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
funded or not funded when when they're
 
02:47:58.830 --> 02:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
vacant and yeah a position can be uh
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
authorized not authorized funded not
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
funded uh filled unfilled so yeah we
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
would and those would obviously be a
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
snapshot in time too so the department
 
02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
could answer questions on those when
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
when they come in does I'm sorry go
 
02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
ahead I was just going to ask also one
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
of the things which you know threw me
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
sort of in the beginning or it took me a
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
while to catch up is
 
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
the aggregate stuff sort of at the end
 
02:48:23.790 --> 02:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
of each area where you know we've got
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
this section and this section and this
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
section and then at the end you've got
 
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
all three sections or 16 sections put
 
02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
together and um I always needed to keep
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
reminding myself that this is aggregate
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
of something that I've already looked at
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
and it should be obvious but it wasn't
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
so obvious to me
 
02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes yeah this Doc before you
 
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
answer that do you understand what she's
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
saying what she's asking oh yeah
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay this document is uh can be a little
 
02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:49.830 align:start position:0%
okay this document is uh can be a little
um

02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
mean on your eyes when you're looking
 
02:48:53.710 --> 02:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
through it and and it it messes with us
 
02:48:56.429 --> 02:48:56.439 align:start position:0%
too they will subtotal at each change in
 
02:48:59.230 --> 02:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
an agency and then uh or not agency
 
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
activity they call it so it could be the
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
division subtotal and then there could
 
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
be a subtotal for now you've got all the
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
general fund accounts in that department
 
02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
then you move to the high it the
 
02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
subtotals can screw you up for sure yep
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:18.190 --> 02:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
those so just to continue on so the
 
02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
agencies will come in they'll they'll
 
02:49:21.550 --> 02:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
make the presentation I'll do like I
 
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
always do if they have requests I'll
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
compile all those for our list of
 
02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
outstanding items as well as the retain
 
02:49:28.110 --> 02:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
bills so this morning we retain two
 
02:49:30.349 --> 02:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
bills so on my tracking sheets I'll add
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
those at the bottom just so they don't
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
fall through the cracks and then the
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
division at a later date can decide what
 
02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
to do as you're going along if you want
 
02:49:39.229 --> 02:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
to make votes and this is where chairman
 
02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
F I'll defer to you how you want to
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
operate um it's not uncommon
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
unprecedented that as an agency's going
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
through somebody may want to say oh well
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to add money
 
02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
here or reduce money here and then you
 
02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
can do that and then I can keep track of
 
02:49:56.429 --> 02:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
everything on the Fly that that's up to
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
the division we've we've done it in two
 
02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
ways before um we've done it doing that
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
we've done it where no actions are taken
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
until another date and that's up to the
 
02:50:06.870 --> 02:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee so I'll give you my take but
 
02:50:08.990 --> 02:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to happy to get some feedback I
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
guess I would be more inclined to have
 
02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
Mr L make a note of that so we can come
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
back to it and talk about it as opposed
 
02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
to keeping the department here talking
 
02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
about it I mean I'm assuming we would
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
have already asked them the questions
 
02:50:22.030 --> 02:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
that would give us the information we're
 
02:50:23.229 --> 02:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
looking for now it's just a matter of
 
02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we want to do but I'm open to
 
02:50:26.190 --> 02:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
feedback if you all have a different
 
02:50:29.790 --> 02:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
point of view well if I can um maybe it
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
was me I didn't know we were going to
 
02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
take motions on the two bills we took
 
02:50:35.790 --> 02:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
motions on this morning so my apologies
 
02:50:37.469 --> 02:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
so if you know you can give a heads up
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
that we so here's a heads up whenever
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
and this is my bad because we're having
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
this meeting after the bills um if we
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
have bills on the on the docket if you
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
will um
 
02:50:51.269 --> 02:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
they'll always be I think they're always
 
02:50:52.670 --> 02:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
in work sessions I think we can always
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
take motions and my my plan is to try to
 
02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
do it just to get them out of the way
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of stuff to worry
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
about and to basically sit and talk
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
about it one day and then come back
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
another day and sit and talk about them
 
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
again um so so if there's bills there as
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
there will be next week I think there's
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
three maybe next week that we'll be um
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
considering what to do with them so we
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
should be we should be prepared to make
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
a motion every time there's a bill on
 
02:51:16.910 --> 02:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
the docket yes I was had that would be
 
02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
the ideal situation yes you can do that
 
02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
okay um so yeah if if the division wants
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
to hold off on making budget change uh
 
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
motions I guess if you will until
 
02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
subsequent work sessions with the
 
02:51:32.429 --> 02:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
agencies aren't here you know doing
 
02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
their presentation that's fine or even
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
after they leave is that is that okay
 
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
with you sure I'm just thinking rather
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
than you know if we want to talk about
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
it I'd rather not tie up the people here
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to zip through
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
whatever thousands of pages of their
 
02:51:46.750 --> 02:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
budget yep yeah I think that's fine I
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
mean you can keep track of the sure
 
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
comment to you yep and and like I said
 
02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have I think the last
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
day that we have an agency schedule for
 
02:51:57.469 --> 02:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
their initial presentation is Monday the
 
02:51:59.710 --> 02:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
10th so that will still give us a good
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
three weeks to have work sessions to
 
02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
either call back agencies if you need
 
02:52:05.429 --> 02:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
more information or have a work session
 
02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
where you just are making motions and
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
taking votes uh we'll obviously have a
 
02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
lot of houseu to stuff to get to at some
 
02:52:14.269 --> 02:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
point too um so yeah the the only
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
changes that I would
 
02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
say if you get a lot lot of like
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
technical changes from the agencies if
 
02:52:23.070 --> 02:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
they come in and say these are some you
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
know we should change them they want to
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
change them if if they if they're like
 
02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
no impact on your state funds and
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're just cleanup that would help me
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
too to get those approved earlier in the
 
02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
process so I can make that those so
 
02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
totally fine and if you just give me the
 
02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
high sign if I if I miss that yeah I'll
 
02:52:39.550 --> 02:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
I'll stop and say and suggest that it
 
02:52:41.309 --> 02:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
makes sense to just vote on this or
 
02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
whatever absolutely okay um so that's
 
02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
all I've got for that document um did
 
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions with in the
 
02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget uh before
 
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
you go on yep does anybody else have any
 
02:52:57.030 --> 02:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions about this the big document
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh the executive summary
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
included uh the governor's revenues as
 
02:53:06.389 --> 02:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
well as Surplus statements I I've got
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund Highway fund
 
02:53:10.229 --> 02:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
and fishing game Surplus statement
 
02:53:11.229 --> 02:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
documents we can go through here
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
separately but did anybody have any
 
02:53:15.790 --> 02:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
questions for and the one thing that
 
02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
jumps out at me is like the VT Revenue I
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
know that's the the video Lottery
 
02:53:22.110 --> 02:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
terminal re Revenue um I think that's
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
tripped up some folks with how that's
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
being done on here um I won't I'll get
 
02:53:28.750 --> 02:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
into it too when we get to the Surplus
 
02:53:28.760 --> 02:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
into it too when we get to the Surplus
statement

02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:53:32.910 --> 02:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
but so in the executive summary the
 
02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:03.630 --> 02:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone on and then go
 
02:54:06.309 --> 02:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
ahead I didn't know we had a v this is
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
gaming a Video Gaming
 
02:54:11.469 --> 02:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
revenue so yeah this is a new proposal
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
and that it's included in in the trailer
 
02:54:18.550 --> 02:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill um it looks like on page 39
 
02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
if you want to see the the governor's
 
02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
recommended Law changes associated with
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
it but I think the idea is to convert
 
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing to oh video
 
02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminals yeah okay I'm sorry
 
02:54:30.429 --> 02:54:30.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a a significant Revenue
 
02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
increase associated with doing that if
 
02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
this goes beyond the so-called what is
 
02:54:37.389 --> 02:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
it historic horse racing thing um these
 
02:54:38.349 --> 02:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
are slot
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
machines and um yeah I think some of us
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
are struggling with this being rather a
 
02:54:44.590 --> 02:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
major change to the legislature and
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
getting it into hb2 is going to be a
 
02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:46.990 align:start position:0%
getting it into hb2 is going to be a
real

02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
challenge I don't know how you feel
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
about slot machines it it is in hp2 so
 
02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.790 --> 02:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
hp2 so
 
02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
um Charlie McIntyre the Lottery
 
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
Commission will be into CS Friday and
 
02:55:04.229 --> 02:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
they'll be prepared to speak on this so
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
I think that' be a good time for this
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee to kind of get all those
 
02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions out there because typically
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
with Lottery we don't have them multiple
 
02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
times their budgets usually pretty
 
02:55:14.190 --> 02:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward this year with a big
 
02:55:16.110 --> 02:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
gaming policy change they're a little
 
02:55:18.670 --> 02:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
bit more um involved perhaps in prior
 
02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
years but we may not have Lottery come
 
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
back again so we'll try to get all that
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
out this
 
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
Friday but as far as that Revenue goes
 
02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
the governor does you see it down on the
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh the table on on page 13 fourth row
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
From The Bottom the uh VT Revenue $10
 
02:55:39.429 --> 02:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal 26 and 117 million in
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 27 so big numbers and the budget
 
02:55:44.429 --> 02:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
does assume half would go to the
 
02:55:45.870 --> 02:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and half would go
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
to the general fund that's how and you
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
may remember representative McGuire's
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
comments yesterday regarding the the
 
02:55:58.590 --> 02:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
deficit with with the uh funds of the
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
legislature versus the funds of the
 
02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and this is part of
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
her revenues which obviously are not
 
02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
included in in ours right
 
02:56:12.190 --> 02:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
now does that make sense okay happens
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
that bill doesn't right right what
 
02:56:16.510 --> 02:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
happens that that bill doesn't pass
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're in trouble well it depends on
 
02:56:20.590 --> 02:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
first of all it's not a bill it's in hb2
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
which is a bill but it'd be part of the
 
02:56:23.910 --> 02:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
budget unless we as representative
 
02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
Murray was positing take it out of there
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
but right then it would obviously not be
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue if we don't it doesn't get
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
passed by the house and the
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and and just to remind folks how
 
02:56:38.190 --> 02:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
the process works is all of the house
 
02:56:39.790 --> 02:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
bill two sections this committee will
 
02:56:41.469 --> 02:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
vote on even if you want to keep them in
 
02:56:43.750 --> 02:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
unchanged that's been the practice just
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
to you're either voting to delete it
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
voting to keep it in or voting to amend
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
it in some way so I always like to have
 
02:56:52.229 --> 02:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of a vote taken on all the
 
02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
sections in there just so it's very
 
02:56:55.710 --> 02:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
clear what division 2's intention was
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
with with house bu two
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations um so that that's all
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
I've got for the base revenues does
 
02:57:04.349 --> 02:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions on on that
 
02:57:06.229 --> 02:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
page sorry do you know where we are I'm
 
02:57:08.429 --> 02:57:08.439 align:start position:0%
not sure yeah I'm catching up thank you
 
02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
um Mickey this question is not really
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
for you it's more for the chair um I'm
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
sorry if I missed the discussion already
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:23.070 --> 02:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
revenues um but it seems to me that this
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
is pretty significant policy change that
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
would be put in the trailer bill without
 
02:57:31.950 --> 02:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
a public hearing unless we hold a public
 
02:57:36.670 --> 02:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on the entire HB to right so my
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
concern is that um you know in the past
 
02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it's been a
 
02:57:44.590 --> 02:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
practice of the state to hold public
 
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
hearings on large policy changes
 
02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering what is the appetite
 
02:57:56.269 --> 02:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
on your side of the of the of the aisle
 
02:57:59.229 --> 02:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
to have like a separate hearing for the
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
V like the slot machine revenues that
 
02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:02.630 align:start position:0%
V like the slot machine revenues that
the

02:58:02.630 --> 02:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:05.710 --> 02:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
governor's um suggesting especially when
 
02:58:08.349 --> 02:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
I think about you know the gap between
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
the overall Governor's revenues and and
 
02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
the house initial estimates for revenues
 
02:58:16.269 --> 02:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh from ways the
 
02:58:20.590 --> 02:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
means you know I'm I'm concerned that we
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
might be a
 
02:58:24.990 --> 02:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
little without public input we might be
 
02:58:27.550 --> 02:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
overstepping our bounds by just enacting
 
02:58:29.469 --> 02:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
you know accepting the governor's plan
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
so um I'm just wondering what the
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
thought pattern is s to be honest I
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been much thought put into
 
02:58:40.229 --> 02:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
it yet um and I would say at this point
 
02:58:43.750 --> 02:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
my one of one of my concerns will be
 
02:58:46.990 --> 02:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
just time um but I I I hear what you're
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
saying and I'm not I'm not opposed to it
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's a question of you know getting
 
02:58:52.349 --> 02:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
getting it all in would but I really
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
haven't given it a lot of thought and
 
02:58:57.190 --> 02:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
while we're while I'm speaking um one of
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
the things we did talk about when you
 
02:59:00.309 --> 02:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
were not here just to touch base with
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
you on it we decided to go through and
 
02:59:04.110 --> 02:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
with the agreement of your colleagues as
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
well Page by page to the budgets want to
 
02:59:07.630 --> 02:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
let you know you're you're good with
 
02:59:09.389 --> 02:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
that okay all
 
02:59:12.070 --> 02:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
right so you'll make a note of
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
the excuse
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
me of the possibility of having a public
 
02:59:18.229 --> 02:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
hearing so at least that's on the list
 
02:59:20.429 --> 02:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
things to think about for the V for the
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
VT thing sure I mean it's that's this
 
02:59:24.510 --> 02:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee can have a work session and
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
open up to whoever you want on any topic
 
02:59:28.349 --> 02:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
you want right but I'll forget so I'm
 
02:59:29.670 --> 02:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sure represent hack and
 
02:59:32.269 --> 02:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
Phillips but but I want you to remind me
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
so that I keep thinking about it and and
 
02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
just to remind everyone we we will have
 
02:59:38.429 --> 02:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on the budget there's
 
02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know House Bill one and House Bill
 
02:59:42.429 --> 02:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
two do have a public hearing so that
 
02:59:44.429 --> 02:59:44.439 align:start position:0%
requirement is is achieved it's not
 
02:59:46.990 --> 02:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
specific to justs but that's that can be
 
02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
something that thinking back to last
 
02:59:51.070 --> 02:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
bayum you know there are a lot of
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
competing interests in the room when
 
02:59:54.269 --> 02:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
that when those public hearings take
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
place and
 
02:59:58.590 --> 02:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
um you know the the benefit of having a
 
03:00:01.630 --> 03:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing on a single you know Bill
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
going through the full Bill process
 
03:00:05.229 --> 03:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
procedur is that you hear the pros and
 
03:00:06.790 --> 03:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
cons from the community you know from
 
03:00:08.910 --> 03:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
the public so uh when you get to the
 
03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
house bill to hearing it's more like
 
03:00:12.510 --> 03:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
people are like we need more money in
 
03:00:14.910 --> 03:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
our section or you left us out is the
 
03:00:16.830 --> 03:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's not really on the merits of the
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
program so I when you have a I mean
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
deciding whether or not to introduce
 
03:00:23.469 --> 03:00:23.479 align:start position:0%
slot machines into the state is a pretty
 
03:00:25.469 --> 03:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
big cultural shift because we don't
 
03:00:29.309 --> 03:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
currently have that so um you know my
 
03:00:31.150 --> 03:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
concern would be you know are we hearing
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
from the public enough about I mean of
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
course we need everybody recognizes the
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
need for more Revenue in the in the
 
03:00:40.910 --> 03:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
current cycle but I think um hearing
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
about the policy merits might be a
 
03:00:46.990 --> 03:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
separate benefit to the process and just
 
03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
just to in case everyone wasn't there is
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
a bill a house bill 728 that is relative
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
to video Lottery terminals so that'll
 
03:00:57.229 --> 03:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
have its own hearing and it's not a
 
03:01:00.510 --> 03:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
senate house house bill 728 um it's I
 
03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
don't think it's deemed a a second
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee bill so we won't get it at
 
03:01:07.710 --> 03:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
this the committee deadline of the March
 
03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
6th but in in theory there should be a
 
03:01:13.630 --> 03:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
house policy set if that bill does go on
 
03:01:15.990 --> 03:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
its own and then perhaps that would be
 
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
turned in or added to house bill to or
 
03:01:18.950 --> 03:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
or something like that do we know which
 
03:01:20.670 --> 03:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee is seeing it or if it's been
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
publicly Ways and Means okay Ways and
 
03:01:25.469 --> 03:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
Means and no hearing scheduled yet okay
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
maybe we could put a request in to have
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
them lover off theirs like maybe we
 
03:01:32.269 --> 03:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
could do a combo or something I don't
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
know yeah you could go or just go to it
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
yeah go yeah so maybe yeah make a note
 
03:01:38.469 --> 03:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
to of that make that you can track that
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
for us and let us know and yeah well
 
03:01:42.429 --> 03:01:42.439 align:start position:0%
yeah if you can encourage them to hold
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
the soon than later but I leave that in
 
03:01:44.160 --> 03:01:46.590 align:start position:0%
the soon than later but I leave that in
your

03:01:46.590 --> 03:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:49.150 --> 03:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
hands yeah well no we have to have all
 
03:01:50.670 --> 03:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
the bills out of the house before we
 
03:01:52.269 --> 03:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
done with the budget so so they would at
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
least have had the public hearing
 
03:01:57.950 --> 03:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
yeah mistaken about that well bills not
 
03:02:00.030 --> 03:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
going to a second committee have a
 
03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
different deadline too so right but our
 
03:02:04.349 --> 03:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
budget has a even longer deadline or at
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
least the same deadline correct no it's
 
03:02:08.550 --> 03:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's after yeah so so they would have to
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
hold the public hearing before we I
 
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
think they would have to report on it by
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
the time you have to finish your work
 
03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm saying like you may
 
03:02:16.830 --> 03:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
you may know the house policy on House
 
03:02:19.710 --> 03:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 728 if it passes then you maybe
 
03:02:21.229 --> 03:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into house bill two if
 
03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
it fails then you've gotta are you g to
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
try Bill two that's yeah um so last day
 
03:02:29.469 --> 03:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
to act on bills not in a second
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
committee is March 20th so that's like a
 
03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
week before our division deadline
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
so if I can just add I guess there are
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
two quirky things that concern me to um
 
03:02:42.349 --> 03:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
even if HB 728 does not get out of
 
03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
committee there's nothing to prevent it
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
from going in
 
03:02:47.950 --> 03:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that's always very frustrating
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
rating when you know this one says no
 
03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
and we stick it in there anyway but
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
that's just you know the nature of the
 
03:02:54.590 --> 03:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
Beast unfortunately and the other thing
 
03:02:56.670 --> 03:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
is um I don't know I haven't looked at
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
728 but I remember this with Kino I
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it pertains to the horses
 
03:03:03.429 --> 03:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
but that passed primarily because
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
Community if I'm correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:03:06.830 --> 03:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
communities had the option of whether or
 
03:03:08.670 --> 03:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
not they wanted to do Kino in their
 
03:03:11.309 --> 03:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
community and this alarms me because
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
there may be communities that do not
 
03:03:15.229 --> 03:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
want slot machines in their community
 
03:03:17.309 --> 03:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
and there's no recourse for the Comm
 
03:03:18.429 --> 03:03:18.439 align:start position:0%
that community
 
03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
um appetite for this and so those are
 
03:03:21.710 --> 03:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
the things that bother me when this goes
 
03:03:24.910 --> 03:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
into hb2 because it just kind of it's it
 
03:03:26.830 --> 03:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
becomes a bulldozer that just wipes out
 
03:03:28.469 --> 03:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
other people's perspectives on some of
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
these things yeah totally fair point I
 
03:03:32.550 --> 03:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
have not yet read what's in hb2 so I
 
03:03:34.349 --> 03:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it LS that or doesn't
 
03:03:35.389 --> 03:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
allow for that but that's a very good
 
03:03:40.110 --> 03:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
agree okay uh one last question while
 
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
before we leave the um unri the budget
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
summary page 13
 
03:03:51.710 --> 03:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
um the DHHS HS
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
recoveries how did that get why is that
 
03:03:55.469 --> 03:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
like a separated out as another piece of
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:03.389 --> 03:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
small um I would have to look and see
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
what the general fund kind of normal
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
revenues are by type it I know that I'm
 
03:04:10.349 --> 03:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that is usually reported
 
03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
separately not part of other all right
 
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
um but I'd have to look I know it's not
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
a education trust fund Revenue so I'm
 
03:04:19.349 --> 03:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
not an expert on that source not our
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um so last thing I'll just remind
 
03:04:24.990 --> 03:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
everyone as far as process when we get
 
03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
into the heat of making decisions and
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
having work sessions on votes if you
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
ever want amendments drafted to come
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
into the committee ready just let me
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
know and I can assist with that whether
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's a amendment to House Bill 2 when
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
when that's introduced or just a change
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
request to Something in house bill one
 
03:04:42.389 --> 03:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
we can we can get that done for you so
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions on the revenues
 
03:04:50.710 --> 03:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we need your um your what's it
 
03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
called your crystal
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
ball is it is it close is it right so I
 
03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
guess this could be a time to talk about
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statements that division two
 
03:05:08.309 --> 03:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
will be responsible for so I handed out
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
um a little paper clipped stack of
 
03:05:13.150 --> 03:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
papers the the first page this is just a
 
03:05:14.670 --> 03:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
reference document we don't really need
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
to go over this it's just a just for my
 
03:05:18.510 --> 03:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
reference I don't have them in order
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
which one you started this is the one
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's Appropriations the government
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation division two yeah so this
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
one is just each agency
 
03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
um uh buy source of funds broken out
 
03:05:33.150 --> 03:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
just as a reference just so you know
 
03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
kind of where the quote where the money
 
03:05:36.510 --> 03:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
is in our division 2
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
agencies um so that's unless anyone has
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
any questions with that I wasn't going
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.389 --> 03:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
the one thing I will just point out I
 
03:05:52.990 --> 03:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
guess with that is under Department of
 
03:05:55.469 --> 03:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
Safety I did break out Highway fund and
 
03:05:57.309 --> 03:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
then Highway fund cost of
 
03:05:59.349 --> 03:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
collections Highway fund cost of
 
03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
collections shows up in the budget as
 
03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
other but that there is almost $40
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
million and you know per year of that
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
cost of collections that is essentially
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
Highway funds so if you make an addition
 
03:06:15.550 --> 03:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
or a subtraction to those accounts
 
03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're affecting the bottom line of the
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
highway fund why don't you describe what
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
goes into that what what are those
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
collections yeah so so by the
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution the department of safety um
 
03:06:28.269 --> 03:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
is entitled to deduct its cost of
 
03:06:30.429 --> 03:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
related to collecting and administering
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
the revenue that it collects so motor
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fees driver's
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
licenses title fees and then the big one
 
03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
is uh road toll too so the gas tax so
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
all the Departments costs associated
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
with administering those programs where
 
03:06:47.710 --> 03:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
that Revenue comes through they charge
 
03:06:49.150 --> 03:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
as they take it off the top of the
 
03:06:50.830 --> 03:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
revenue they collect and then remit the
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
difference to the highway fund so if
 
03:06:55.150 --> 03:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
their cost goes up less money goes to
 
03:06:57.389 --> 03:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and vice versa so it's
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
just something to remember when you get
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
to safety's budget primarily the
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicle and the road
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
tool Bureau that's really where it all
 
03:07:07.630 --> 03:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
is most of it does that make sense
 
03:07:09.630 --> 03:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
because that can be very I know for me
 
03:07:12.269 --> 03:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
very confusing How would how would we
 
03:07:14.670 --> 03:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
know what those cost are put your mic on
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
and how would we know what those costs
 
03:07:18.030 --> 03:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
are where are those
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's where I'm saying
 
03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
It's Tricky so when we get into the
 
03:07:24.750 --> 03:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
department of safety's budget um almost
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
all of the division a motor vehicle
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
where you see other and then the road
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
toll Bureau where you see other is is
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
these two things and um I can send a
 
03:07:35.830 --> 03:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown by accounting unit to everyone
 
03:07:38.309 --> 03:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
so you've got it but it's basic like 99%
 
03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
of it is there that would be nice okay
 
03:07:43.349 --> 03:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but the department as they're
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
going through when we're flipping Pages
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
they'll get to oh this account this is
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
cost a collect so this so they should
 
03:07:51.429 --> 03:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
tell us as we're going through and it's
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
a very confusing words to meet that
 
03:07:56.670 --> 03:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.590 --> 03:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.550 --> 03:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
Aus all right so we'll get into the
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
Surplus statements real quick just so
 
03:08:06.990 --> 03:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
you can kind of see what I would say our
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
quote starting point is perhaps so the
 
03:08:10.830 --> 03:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
one that's maybe a little bit too small
 
03:08:13.269 --> 03:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
document um for all three of these for
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
Education trust fund Highway fishing aim
 
03:08:20.229 --> 03:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
I did build the governor's proposal in
 
03:08:23.910 --> 03:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
the Shaded versus division 2 is kind of
 
03:08:25.950 --> 03:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
where your starting point is which is
 
03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
essentially house Ways and Means
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
revenues built on top of the governor's
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
budget with a couple differences but
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you about those here in a sec
 
03:08:36.670 --> 03:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal 25 I just want to point out
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
three significant um costs that the
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
division 2 will have to account for that
 
03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:51.630 align:start position:0%
 
24

03:08:51.630 --> 03:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
24
 
03:08:56.229 --> 03:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
28 and 32 those are adequacy charter
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
school and education Freedom account
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
warrants so what what that is
 
03:09:10.389 --> 03:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.429 --> 03:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
32 sorry 28 I'm talking about small is
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
28 yeah
 
03:09:19.750 --> 03:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah the three- hole punch probably
 
03:09:21.750 --> 03:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
messed with this didn't it
 
03:09:26.469 --> 03:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so yeah 24 28 and
 
03:09:29.550 --> 03:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
32 so what these rows indicate or what
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
they represent is um costs of those
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
three programs that exceeded how much
 
03:09:38.990 --> 03:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
was budgeted for them so for adequacy we
 
03:09:40.830 --> 03:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
know we W $1 million over and I'm
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the the first um not unshaded
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
column 11125 million Charter School is
 
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
6174 million and efas was
 
03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
10.6 so these were amounts that exceeded
 
03:09:56.550 --> 03:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
what was budgeted but the department has
 
03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
authority to draw a warrant to make sure
 
03:10:01.269 --> 03:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
they pay whatever is required by
 
03:10:03.630 --> 03:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
law the governor's budget didn't account
 
03:10:05.309 --> 03:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
for those but we know by the end of this
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
year those are the amounts do doe has
 
03:10:11.190 --> 03:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
reported those amounts as um as coming
 
03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
in incoming warrants that they're going
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
to have to draw so I'm I'm accounting
 
03:10:18.510 --> 03:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
for those in the division 2 column
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is why if you look you know it all
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
plays into the bottom line but that that
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
was essentially 27 plus Million worth of
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
cost that you've got to account for that
 
03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
the governor didn't just I'm not could
 
03:10:50.030 --> 03:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:03.469 --> 03:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
to and the other thing I'll just point
 
03:11:09.309 --> 03:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
out on line 49 there was a $4.5 million
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
gap adjustment included in the
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
governor's Surplus statement for the
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that we've been
 
03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
working with admin services that we're
 
03:11:18.030 --> 03:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily sure for
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
budgeting purposes should be reflected
 
03:11:21.750 --> 03:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
which is why you see in the column
 
03:11:24.269 --> 03:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
beside we don't have the $4.5 million
 
03:11:26.910 --> 03:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
there those four changes the three above
 
03:11:28.830 --> 03:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
and then that is really the only
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
difference in any of the um
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation and uses lines for all
 
03:11:37.950 --> 03:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
three years between the governor and
 
03:11:39.389 --> 03:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
division two because that's we're
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
starting at the governor's that's why
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's no other differences right um
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
but you can see when you put in the
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
house ways and means Revenue estimates
 
03:11:50.349 --> 03:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
compared to the governor's the bottom
 
03:11:53.550 --> 03:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
lines are very different each year so
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
looking ahead at the very bottom of
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal 27 the governor had about $14
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
million 13.9 83 million of an education
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.110 --> 03:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
anticipated the house division two with
 
03:12:09.630 --> 03:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
where we're at with the revenue
 
03:12:14.349 --> 03:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
estimates baked in on lines on line 53
 
03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 26 requires a 26.1 .44 million
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
general fund transfer to balance and
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
then another
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
79577 million so essentially over the
 
03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
bayum $105 million the education trust
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
fund is deficit and the that would
 
03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:35.510 align:start position:0%
fund is deficit and the that would
require

03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:39.389 --> 03:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
so um so yeah um a little bit of a
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
deficit obviously for division two to
 
03:12:43.950 --> 03:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
start its work um with with those
 
03:12:53.950 --> 03:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.229 --> 03:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
does this make sense is there any
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
questions with with this I know it's
 
03:12:58.429 --> 03:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
kind of a busy document to just throw
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
throw at you here
 
03:13:04.830 --> 03:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
but muray yeah thank you um the times
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
I've been here um we've never had a
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
deficit as I can recall in the education
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund so for me this is the first
 
03:13:13.389 --> 03:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
time that I'm seeing a deficit I mean
 
03:13:15.550 --> 03:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
this is draining the education trust
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
fund can you speak to uh what's happened
 
03:13:22.030 --> 03:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
before at other times when um we've when
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been enough money in the
 
03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to cover the costs
 
03:13:27.950 --> 03:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
um does that come off first from the
 
03:13:30.990 --> 03:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
general fund or where are we listed in
 
03:13:33.630 --> 03:13:33.640 align:start position:0%
that I don't I don't think there's a
 
03:13:35.590 --> 03:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
like a waterfall or anything like a
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
ranking but by law the general fund
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
would transfer in any deficit um to the
 
03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so when we're
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
building these Surplus statements if you
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
end up passing a budget that the
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
education Trust fund does need a draw
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're accounting for that on the general
 
03:13:53.469 --> 03:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
fund side so we we will take that into
 
03:13:57.389 --> 03:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
consideration um but yeah in in reality
 
03:14:00.510 --> 03:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
if if we needed to balance the education
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
trust fund with more than what was
 
03:14:03.550 --> 03:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
available in the general fund that
 
03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be great obviously but I think
 
03:14:06.510 --> 03:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
it could potentially bring the general
 
03:14:08.349 --> 03:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
fund into a negative and then you'd look
 
03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
at Randy day fund perhaps I think that's
 
03:14:13.630 --> 03:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
you know my follow-up question pertains
 
03:14:18.269 --> 03:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
to that um what if Finance as a whole
 
03:14:21.429 --> 03:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
decides that um can they cut the budget
 
03:14:22.990 --> 03:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
that we've con that we've constructed
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
for Education because it's too much you
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
has that ever happened that they've cut
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
the education budget at that it's come
 
03:14:31.110 --> 03:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
from Divi division
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
two who who's cut it the full committee
 
03:14:39.150 --> 03:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um it's it's not typical that the
 
03:14:41.389 --> 03:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
full committee will will deviate from
 
03:14:43.110 --> 03:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
what the divisions recommend because our
 
03:14:44.830 --> 03:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully our division recommendations
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
kind of all work with each other um but
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing you know
 
03:14:51.150 --> 03:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
procedurally that would prevent the full
 
03:14:55.990 --> 03:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:58.830 --> 03:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
changes yeah I mean it looks like um
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
we've got potentially a $700 million gap
 
03:15:05.950 --> 03:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
and um we're going to work really hard
 
03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
or we will all work really
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
hard to support you know the education
 
03:15:13.469 --> 03:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
and what needs to be done for education
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
but there's a potential that the finance
 
03:15:17.630 --> 03:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
full committee could decide that that's
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
too much for education and end up
 
03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
cutting what we've put together and um
 
03:15:23.790 --> 03:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
this I've not seen that but I'm you know
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert here but I'm you know
 
03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned
 
03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
about having the responsibility of
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
Education a little bit taken away from
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
us when the larger committee will say
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're no you need we're going to cut a
 
03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
couple hundred million out of education
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
and what I hear you saying is that yes
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
possibility I would say it's a a
 
03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
feasibility like it's it's like it's
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing stopping a member from
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
introducing an amendment at any time you
 
03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
know for this well even a floor
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment at some point but typically
 
03:15:52.830 --> 03:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
division recommendations on the budget
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
tend to hold up as the finance
 
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
committee's full recommendation it's
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
usually not amended but it's not
 
03:15:58.239 --> 03:15:59.670 align:start position:0%
usually not amended but it's not
unprecedented

03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
either thank you um Mickey I'm now that
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're having this conversation I'm
 
03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
having flashbacks to Mary Heath sitting
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the room saying
 
03:16:11.710 --> 03:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a precedent in the past
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
where the education trust fund was not
 
03:16:16.590 --> 03:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
enough and that General funds were
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
supped supposed to backfill the educ
 
03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for things like you
 
03:16:23.710 --> 03:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
know catastrophic Aid at the time I
 
03:16:26.110 --> 03:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
think was the example she was giving uh
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
for special education but because of the
 
03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:30.670 align:start position:0%
for special education but because of the
overall

03:16:30.670 --> 03:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:16:33.950 --> 03:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget uh challenges the general fund
 
03:16:36.429 --> 03:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
didn't fully replenish what came back
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
into educ education trust fund and so
 
03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
many of those uh like reimbursements
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
were not paid in full even though we had
 
03:16:48.269 --> 03:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
a statutory requirement to do so
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm just having a little bit of a
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
panic moment here is that
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
right do you remember something like
 
03:16:58.030 --> 03:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
that happening in the past no I I can't
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
recall the programs that have that open
 
03:17:03.150 --> 03:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
warrant of not having money available to
 
03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
it um in the case of like cat a like
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
special education a that is bound to the
 
03:17:09.510 --> 03:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation and there is no mechanism
 
03:17:11.950 --> 03:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
to draw more money through the year so
 
03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's a that's different than how
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy it would be treated for
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
instance so yeah I can't think of a time
 
03:17:22.070 --> 03:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.910 --> 03:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
happened no problem get all these things
 
03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
happened no problem get all these things
out

03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
now I should say that I misremembered
 
03:17:31.110 --> 03:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
Mickey so I will point out one last
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
thing on this education trust fund
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement up on lines 15 through
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh 19 these are the revenue adjustments
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
so the the first section of revenues
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's what the revenue estimates are
 
03:17:46.830 --> 03:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
based on current law okay uh
 
03:17:48.429 --> 03:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
representative uh hack and Phillips will
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
remember that from Ways and Means um
 
03:17:51.670 --> 03:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
that that those are current law
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
estimates the revenue adjustments are
 
03:17:55.229 --> 03:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
anything that's in house bill to that
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
would change those so the governor has a
 
03:17:59.950 --> 03:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
few things one being the the video
 
03:18:02.710 --> 03:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
Lottery terminal uh Revenue we see that
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
5 million in the first year 58.5 in the
 
03:18:06.030 --> 03:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
second year because remember this is
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
just education trust fund the other half
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
is in the general fund but then the
 
03:18:12.429 --> 03:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
governor's budget also uh changes the
 
03:18:16.189 --> 03:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
splits of revenues for business taxes uh
 
03:18:18.510 --> 03:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco and real estate transfer so this
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
was probably an effort in in the
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
governor's uh phase to see that in in
 
03:18:25.550 --> 03:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's plan there would have
 
03:18:26.790 --> 03:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
been a lot of extra money in the
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
education trust fund you can see these
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue split changes for business tax
 
03:18:34.870 --> 03:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
alone is like $85 million a year that's
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
turning education trust fund Revenue
 
03:18:39.229 --> 03:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
into general fund Revenue so that'll be
 
03:18:40.910 --> 03:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
in House Bill too we'll have to figure
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
out uh if Dr if division one or division
 
03:18:45.870 --> 03:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
two or if it's going to be a kind of a
 
03:18:47.550 --> 03:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
higher level committee decision of what
 
03:18:48.910 --> 03:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
to do with splits because there has been
 
03:18:50.830 --> 03:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
talks about moving other programs to the
 
03:18:53.110 --> 03:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
general fund again or so that's
 
03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
something division 2 can deal with um as
 
03:18:55.359 --> 03:19:00.309 align:start position:0%
something division 2 can deal with um as
we

03:19:00.309 --> 03:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:02.189 --> 03:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
progress if we're good with that one we
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
can move to the highway fund Surplus
 
03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:17.469 align:start position:0%
can move to the highway fund Surplus
statement

03:19:17.469 --> 03:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.189 --> 03:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
landscape so similarly the the big
 
03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
difference between the uh governor in
 
03:19:35.790 --> 03:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
the division 2 column is the revenues uh
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
as well as if you look on page 15 excuse
 
03:19:42.510 --> 03:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
me line 15 uh the transfers from Surplus
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
I think there was a 2 uh or 1.9 million
 
03:19:50.189 --> 03:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
dollar whatever it was uh transfer that
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
the governor didn't pick up in in their
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
budget that we picked up here um other
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
than that it's pretty which line were
 
03:19:59.150 --> 03:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
you just on line 15 the one that says
 
03:20:01.870 --> 03:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
9.2 and 10.5 so there was like a
 
03:20:04.750 --> 03:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
1.29 million doll Surplus transfer that
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't included in the governor's
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
numbers but I've included it in the
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
division 2 transfer that's already
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
occurred um2
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
million2 oh you're doing the math in
 
03:20:16.349 --> 03:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
your head yeah okay um I was looking for
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
1 too sorry uh and I will point out we
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
talked about cost of collections so on
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
lines 8 n is where you'll see 8 n and 10
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
is where you'll see how cost of
 
03:20:26.510 --> 03:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
collections is recognized on the highway
 
03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
fund Surplus statement so you see the
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
gross revenues on line seven and then we
 
03:20:34.030 --> 03:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
minus out how much you've allowed
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to spend in their
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
cost of collections budget and then that
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
next line is we assume they're not going
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
to spend every nickel that you've
 
03:20:43.229 --> 03:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
authorized them to there's a lapse there
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
too so that's that's how the cost of
 
03:20:48.030 --> 03:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
collections plays into into the overall
 
03:20:51.429 --> 03:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
Highway fund picture as it impacts
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh long story short the governor
 
03:20:58.349 --> 03:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
had the um Highway fund balance right to
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
a penny you can see there's zero dollars
 
03:21:01.469 --> 03:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
left over at the end of the bayum after
 
03:21:02.510 --> 03:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
a gap
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment um putting in the house
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
revenues and that one other adjustment
 
03:21:09.630 --> 03:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
um we about six almost $6.5 million do
 
03:21:13.150 --> 03:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
in a deficit when you hear from dot um
 
03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
they'll have to explain some impacts to
 
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
potential services that their budget
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
level could could result in uh as well
 
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
as the lapse estimate is on the higher
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
side for each year and they can speak to
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
if that would impact their ability to
 
03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
fill funded positions or if they would
 
03:21:32.590 --> 03:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
have to keep them open to meet a laps
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
estimate or anything so so when dot
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
comes in I believe next uh not next
 
03:21:39.269 --> 03:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the Wednesday after um they'll
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
this yeah so on fiscal 27 the Shaded
 
03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
column all the way to the bottom you'll
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
see the ending balance is
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
0 oh right next to it
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah Mickey will you remind us of those
 
03:22:00.349 --> 03:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
two questions if we forget to ask do
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
when they're here yeah when we're I'm
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
going to try to stay kind of in my Lane
 
03:22:07.389 --> 03:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit during meetings over there
 
03:22:09.229 --> 03:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
but if it helps the committee when we
 
03:22:11.150 --> 03:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
get to certain things I'll I'll try to
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
just remind the agency to hey can you
 
03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
speak to this while you're here just so
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
so you know we don't forget about it so
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's one for sure uh the other
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
thing too to to note when not to
 
03:22:23.950 --> 03:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but just to follow what
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
you said so what you're saying that the
 
03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
governor's zero lapse is a very low
 
03:22:31.030 --> 03:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
lapse for unusually low lapse for the
 
03:22:36.189 --> 03:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
22 a $39 million lapse and that's low or
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
high that's a high that's a higher than
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
usual estimate they've they hit that
 
03:22:45.389 --> 03:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
lapse in 25 it looks like they're going
 
03:22:47.910 --> 03:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
to hit there in 24 was kind of big but I
 
03:22:49.389 --> 03:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
think they're getting to that number by
 
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
not filling certain positions and so we
 
03:22:53.550 --> 03:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
just need to talk about continuing that
 
03:22:55.950 --> 03:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
lapse expectation how that impacts their
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
operations so if she misses that lapse
 
03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
then the deficit is going to be a lot
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
larger correct yeah so if you laps 34
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
million instead of 39 that's a $5
 
03:23:07.469 --> 03:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
million impact to your bottom line
 
03:23:07.479 --> 03:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
million impact to your bottom line
correct

03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
um the other thing too is you you
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
probably have all noticed that dot will
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal and draw from uh Highway
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
Surplus for winter maintenance typically
 
03:23:21.429 --> 03:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
the winter maintenance budget is set at
 
03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
a certain level and then uh busier than
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
usual winter could result in them
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
needing to come to fiscal to draw from
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
Surplus Highway funds well if the
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
budget's built on no Surplus they could
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
they could raise the question of uh well
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
where are we drawing from if there's
 
03:23:39.630 --> 03:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
plan of no money in there you know
 
03:23:42.750 --> 03:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
so can I ask I'm trying I can't recall
 
03:23:44.229 --> 03:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
when they go to fiscal for additional
 
03:23:46.750 --> 03:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
money you know for as you you were
 
03:23:46.760 --> 03:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
money you know for as you you were
saying

03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
um does does that money lap go over from
 
03:23:53.349 --> 03:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
year to year because I always think
 
03:23:55.309 --> 03:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
about those years where we don't have a
 
03:23:56.910 --> 03:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
lot of snow and we're making up for it
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
this year but I can't remember if does
 
03:24:01.030 --> 03:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
those funds roll over or is it starting
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
over again every year uh it it typically
 
03:24:06.429 --> 03:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
will go no longer than the bium so it
 
03:24:08.189 --> 03:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
elapse at the end of the bium sometimes
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
it lapse at the end of the fiscal year
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
depending on how they made their request
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
to fiscal sometimes they say just for
 
03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year we ask for this and
 
03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
back so that's the highway
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
fund and then probably the easiest one
 
03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
here at this point to as far as uh how
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
busy it is is the fishing game fund
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement the next the next page
 
03:24:36.510 --> 03:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
um the governor gave fishing game no
 
03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:37.469 align:start position:0%
um the governor gave fishing game no
General

03:24:37.469 --> 03:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
General
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
funds like nothing in um enforcement
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit which we've budgeted the
 
03:24:45.269 --> 03:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
last couple terms and then no additional
 
03:24:47.150 --> 03:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
like transfer into the game fund or
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
anything so when you notice what's going
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
on here in the top left cell under
 
03:24:57.150 --> 03:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 uh $13.2 million is how much
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh going into fiscal 25 fishing game
 
03:25:01.189 --> 03:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
fund had and then you go all the way to
 
03:25:03.630 --> 03:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
the bottom right corner they're down to
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know a million bucks and that's
 
03:25:07.189 --> 03:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
because this budget is built on them
 
03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
using their Surplus essentially to get
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
through uh I would I would say it would
 
03:25:15.309 --> 03:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
create an issue for the next bium if if
 
03:25:16.630 --> 03:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's funded in this way and there's no
 
03:25:19.150 --> 03:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
change to uh sources of fund for the
 
03:25:21.229 --> 03:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund or uses or anything
 
03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
like that but
 
03:25:25.750 --> 03:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah the way it's built now there's
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
no General funds they appear they can
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
balance and get through this by Anum um
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
it representative Dy what effectively
 
03:25:41.389 --> 03:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
does that Doe to
 
03:25:41.399 --> 03:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
does that Doe to
them

03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
um they've been this low before it has
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
um so yeah and then we've helped them
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
for many years with General funds
 
03:25:55.269 --> 03:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
um I think it just probably just creates
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit of uncertainty for them
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
building their next budget you know
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
obviously any self-funded agency with a
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund would like to have a big
 
03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
reserve on hand um they've built one
 
03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
here in the last few years I think the
 
03:26:10.670 --> 03:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic helped that um but this budget
 
03:26:12.070 --> 03:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
the way the governor recommends it is
 
03:26:13.870 --> 03:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
built on basically spending all that
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
Surplus to get through instead of using
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
general funds or increasing fees or
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
03:26:21.550 --> 03:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
that yeah go
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
ahead do they anticipate on hiring any
 
03:26:26.189 --> 03:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
more individuals I understand that they
 
03:26:30.670 --> 03:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
are low on officers uh for fishing gain
 
03:26:33.030 --> 03:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
so this budget is built on a pretty
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
significant increase so if you look on
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
line seven you know their budget from
 
03:26:41.429 --> 03:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
two years ago was 17.4 million and this
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
goes up to 20 so they've got full
 
03:26:46.830 --> 03:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
Authority here to spend up to their full
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
request um so there's no limit on that
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
their only limit would be is if they
 
03:26:52.510 --> 03:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend as much as their
 
03:26:54.630 --> 03:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
Surplus as the governor is built the
 
03:26:54.640 --> 03:26:55.429 align:start position:0%
Surplus as the governor is built the
budget

03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
on but there's authority to spend and
 
03:26:59.469 --> 03:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
there seems to be money to spend it's
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
just they would probably rather not
 
03:27:03.189 --> 03:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
spend their savings account yeah and
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just point out that a lot of Bud a
 
03:27:07.229 --> 03:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
lot of the Departments of the state
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
including DHHS and everywhere else we
 
03:27:11.070 --> 03:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
looking they have a bud a whole big
 
03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
budget it's you know out of General
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
funds and they all make it work so the
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
notion that that fisher game might be
 
03:27:19.030 --> 03:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
General budget general fund budget is
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
not a crisis there are a lot of many
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that I was trying to
 
03:27:25.630 --> 03:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
study and I couldn't even begin to get
 
03:27:27.950 --> 03:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
through them um and it's not clear to me
 
03:27:29.349 --> 03:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
that that's the most efficient way to
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
allocate funds because you've got funds
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
going from like MV into something that
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the dep Motor
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
Vehicles is like you know why kind of
 
03:27:40.990 --> 03:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
thing so um it's not the end of the
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
world if uh if if General funds get
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
transferred in there by by need and and
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
fishing gamees not unique here so just
 
03:27:49.870 --> 03:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
flipping back to the highway fund
 
03:27:51.950 --> 03:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement you see we start
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 with almost 124 million and
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
end with in the governor's budget with
 
03:27:59.189 --> 03:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
nothing so it's the same idea there it's
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
using Surplus to balance these two years
 
03:28:04.229 --> 03:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the same thing so
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's you've got that um Reliance on the
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
Surplus to start this bu anym to get
 
03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.389 --> 03:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
documents do you want to go through the
 
03:28:41.950 --> 03:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
trailer bill I can point us to the
 
03:28:43.469 --> 03:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
sections I think we'll ultim I would say
 
03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
yes unless somebody here is averse to it
 
03:28:45.399 --> 03:28:48.110 align:start position:0%
yes unless somebody here is averse to it
NOP

03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
and and we will so for those new to the
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
process this is the first year that the
 
03:28:58.110 --> 03:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
governor was required by law to produce
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
a draft of the trailer bill by February
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
15th so typically we wouldn't even see a
 
03:29:05.070 --> 03:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
draft for a couple weeks and then get a
 
03:29:07.309 --> 03:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
actual introduce house bill to maybe
 
03:29:09.189 --> 03:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
three weeks after the 15th but this year
 
03:29:11.710 --> 03:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
we at least have something OS is working
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
on uh getting this into a bill form and
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get that sooner than later
 
03:29:20.429 --> 03:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
um and we that will become our trailer
 
03:29:22.110 --> 03:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
Bill working document but for now we can
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
at least see some of the the things the
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
governor is proposing
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
so the first thing was the on page 14
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
the cell phone use policy so for school
 
03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
districts um to establish a policy in
 
03:29:41.309 --> 03:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
which uh cell phones are limited if not
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
prohibited for the school day um the
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
budget impact of this is there is a
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars in house bill one for
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
this um when the department comes in I
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
think if you're on page 14 of the
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill document that second
 
03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph that paragraph b um you know
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
establish a grant program administered
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
by the department and they can establish
 
03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
rules uh it's it seems
 
03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
pretty to me it seems pretty silent on
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
some of the rules of this like how much
 
03:30:12.269 --> 03:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
could a grant be what would happen if
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money what are
 
03:30:15.070 --> 03:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursable like a lot of questions so
 
03:30:16.309 --> 03:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
I would think when the department dep of
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
Education comes in you could ask them
 
03:30:20.429 --> 03:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
about that yeah I noticed there was like
 
03:30:23.950 --> 03:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
no um description of how to rank like
 
03:30:25.469 --> 03:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
because I assume there'll be you know
 
03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
how many how many districts are in the
 
03:30:28.469 --> 03:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
state how many schools can apply for
 
03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
this grant like how do you know who's
 
03:30:33.429 --> 03:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
get more meritorious and yeah anyway
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
there's lots of questions and you can't
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
just send it to Jael car like that
 
03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
without a little bit more direction
 
03:30:40.830 --> 03:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
right I would agree it's it's pretty uh
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
a generic of an instruction for a
 
03:30:43.870 --> 03:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
program like that I would think so we'll
 
03:30:47.790 --> 03:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
see what the department says about that
 
03:30:49.469 --> 03:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
yes go
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm probably pretty naive here why
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
would it cost a million dollars for a
 
03:30:58.110 --> 03:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
law to go out that says okay at the door
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
all the cell phones have to stay outside
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
I don't understand
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
it um I'm not I'm not an expert on this
 
03:31:07.349 --> 03:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
but I've heard that there could be some
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
cost to districts in in Rel relative to
 
03:31:12.590 --> 03:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
security of the cell phon so if they're
 
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining possession of all the
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
student cell phones they may need to set
 
03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
up some sort sort of infrastructure to
 
03:31:20.910 --> 03:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
keep those phones private and secure um
 
03:31:23.469 --> 03:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's the most notable uh cost
 
03:31:26.229 --> 03:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
that I've heard relative to this um I
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
can tell you there there are two bills
 
03:31:29.590 --> 03:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
out there a Senate bill and a house bill
 
03:31:32.349 --> 03:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
relative to this the Senate bill has no
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
money attached to it the house bill I
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
think has a quarter of a million dollars
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
attached to it so it's it's less than
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
the million um the department doesn't
 
03:31:42.830 --> 03:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
have obviously when you get into
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
estimating costs at a local school
 
03:31:47.150 --> 03:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
district level it's difficult with the
 
03:31:48.830 --> 03:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
the wide range of different districts
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
and some districts may already have
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
something set up and there's no impact
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
to them um so that's where it gets
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
tricky to to kind of cost us out yeah I
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
guess some school districts have already
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
made progress in this regard and you can
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
buy little packets that you put your
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
cell phone in which is protected from
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
people trying to you know break into
 
03:32:08.150 --> 03:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
your cell phone uh still begs the
 
03:32:10.110 --> 03:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
question of where those cell phones are
 
03:32:12.389 --> 03:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
in the school with kids and then how you
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
know how you pick them up how the kids
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
can you imagine a school of 500 students
 
03:32:17.309 --> 03:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
is trying to all get their cell phones
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and so but but I
 
03:32:22.830 --> 03:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
think the cost primarily that I
 
03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
associate with this is buying those
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
little packets and you can ask is that
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
our job to do that or is that the
 
03:32:30.910 --> 03:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
school's job or then you start people
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
start saying unended mandate or mandate
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
so it'll be a conversation absolutely
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
and I just point out my understanding is
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's a grant program so this local
 
03:32:42.030 --> 03:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
school districts are able to apply for
 
03:32:43.389 --> 03:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
up to a certain amount or something of
 
03:32:47.189 --> 03:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
next if we're if we're good with that
 
03:32:53.550 --> 03:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
one the next one I think is on page 24
 
03:33:01.309 --> 03:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
accounts so I think we heard the
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
governor say her her plan here but
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
essentially there's no change to
 
03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility in fiscal 26 and then fiscal
 
03:33:12.830 --> 03:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
27 would essentially have no income
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for EFA applicants if they
 
03:33:17.630 --> 03:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
coming from a public school they had to
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
they would have had to have been in the
 
03:33:22.070 --> 03:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
public school for all of the 2025 26
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
school year essentially and then they'd
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
be eligible Universal eligibility for an
 
03:33:28.550 --> 03:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
EFA so it would only be for I think
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
they've been referred to as jumpers in
 
03:33:30.160 --> 03:33:36.550 align:start position:0%
they've been referred to as jumpers in
the

03:33:36.550 --> 03:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
past and we had talked about having the
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
children scholarship fund come to
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
division 2 is that something that we we
 
03:33:46.510 --> 03:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
want to schedule on a certain day
 
03:33:47.950 --> 03:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know about a certain day but yes
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:33:54.309 --> 03:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
oh so that's another one that we were
 
03:34:03.870 --> 03:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
talking about having somebody come in so
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
right now I think uh Friday March 7th is
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
an open day so maybe that could be a day
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
I schedule some some uh visitors I guess
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
say some guests to come in and talk
 
03:34:17.070 --> 03:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
about a couple issues with us
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
um as sort of a heads up we may well ask
 
03:34:24.990 --> 03:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
for some um amendments with regards to
 
03:34:26.189 --> 03:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
this I know a lot of us are very
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about accountability that you
 
03:34:31.870 --> 03:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
only have to apply once in 12 years um I
 
03:34:33.309 --> 03:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
don't think if there's any other program
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
where you only apply once with regards
 
03:34:37.150 --> 03:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
like food Security Programs this is the
 
03:34:39.189 --> 03:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
only one that you have to do it once and
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're done and so Democrats may be
 
03:34:44.110 --> 03:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
putting in amendments around you can
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
guess what they are I'm there will be
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.990 --> 03:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
here surprise you'll be an expert with
 
03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:57.870 align:start position:0%
here surprise you'll be an expert with
no

03:34:57.870 --> 03:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
time did you say March probably March
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
7th I think is an open day that we have
 
03:35:06.670 --> 03:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
um that'll probably end up being a day
 
03:35:09.389 --> 03:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
with some of these guests as well as I
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
think we're going to get some more bills
 
03:35:12.990 --> 03:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
off the floor tomorrow so maybe we'll do
 
03:35:15.750 --> 03:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
March 7th can be all that
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
so I'll just let everybody else know
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
that in case you've forgotten as well
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
they'll know too um I won it's okay it
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
runs in in the afternoon we do the bills
 
03:35:24.189 --> 03:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
in the morning um but I do have my
 
03:35:26.349 --> 03:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
daughter getting married that weekend so

Mississippi for no no no no no no I
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to uh I definitely keep this
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
process going I'm already in trouble for
 
03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
next week congratulations that's a big
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
deal thank you yeah yes it is in our
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
four no no no no well in the morning

03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
things run but no I'm not too worried
 
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
about it it's I just want to let you all
 
03:35:51.070 --> 03:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
know so
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
Friday so with EFA just reminder there
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
is a line in the budget for efas and the
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
governor did appropriate additional
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
money in fiscal 20 7 to reflect um the
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
expansion I guess we'll say in the
 
03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
second year uh when the department comes
 
03:36:24.990 --> 03:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
in you can ask them about those levels
 
03:36:27.429 --> 03:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
if they think they're could you remind
 
03:36:33.150 --> 03:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
us what the yep $ 14.7 million oh in
 
03:36:36.189 --> 03:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
addition in addition so recall that when
 
03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking the the brilliant part in
 
03:36:40.750 --> 03:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
my my opinion of the governor doing it
 
03:36:43.349 --> 03:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
the way she's doing it is that it really
 
03:36:47.070 --> 03:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
it reduces the hit to are costs because
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
you're basically taking a public school
 
03:36:50.429 --> 03:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
student who's already getting public
 
03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
school funding and transferring it to um
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
the EFA as opposed to the private school
 
03:36:58.750 --> 03:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
situation where there is no Current
 
03:37:01.229 --> 03:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
public money going to that so that full
 
03:37:02.750 --> 03:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
hit that goes with the public school
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
child is much higher so that's I I and
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
homeo exactly homeschooling too
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure so in 26 there's 29.5 million
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:20.469 --> 03:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
4 uh
 
03:37:24.830 --> 03:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
29.5 in 26 fiscal 26 and then
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
44.1 uh so the question about 26 I think
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
you could ask as well since is is 29.5
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient when fiscal 25 was over 30
 
03:37:36.389 --> 03:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
million okay so I think that's a good
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
question for the department when they
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
come in this is one of the programs that
 
03:37:41.990 --> 03:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
is attached to an open warrant but you'd
 
03:37:42.990 --> 03:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
still probably want to know when you're
 
03:37:45.150 --> 03:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
crafting the budget where that where
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
that lines up with with
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
estimates since it's been so popular
 
03:37:52.830 --> 03:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
right it's grown every year so if we're
 
03:37:54.189 --> 03:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
further expanding it we should at least
 
03:37:56.349 --> 03:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
be covering what it cost last time I
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:03.790 --> 03:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
responsible uh the next section on the
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
next page page 25 is relative to the
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes Headwaters uh is this
 
03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
our SEC
 
03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
division so it's tell me I think fishing
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
game kind of oversees it
 
03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
resources is your Trails Bureau but I
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
think this is in a statute
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
that yeah no it's I mean it's
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is another bill that um a
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
very similar piece of legislation is in
 
03:38:34.590 --> 03:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
the works of House Bill 127 there's no
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to this I think we have an
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
under 10k fiscal note on it just because
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
they thought there might be an extra
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
week of enforcement costs um but
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's a no impact provision
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
this could be something depending on
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
what happens with House Bill 127
 
03:38:47.910 --> 03:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need to you can just delete it
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
from House Bill 2 if it's passing in a
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
separate piece of
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislation so we'll I'll monitor House
 
03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:57.670 align:start position:0%
legislation so we'll I'll monitor House
Bill

03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:57.680 --> 03:39:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
127

03:39:02.710 --> 03:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
then h on the
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
HRV I'm trying to remember the testimony
 
03:39:12.269 --> 03:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
that there um it's potential it's one of
 
03:39:15.389 --> 03:39:15.399 align:start position:0%
those things that has local impact even
 
03:39:16.349 --> 03:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
know it's something that's not covered
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
to the state but in terms of Maintenance
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
and keeping trails open that there could
 
03:39:22.750 --> 03:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
be an impact locally or am I
 
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
misremembering that or just totally
 
03:39:26.670 --> 03:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
making it up you know you remember that
 
03:39:26.680 --> 03:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
making it up you know you remember that
too

03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:33.070 align:start position:0%
too
yeah

03:39:33.070 --> 03:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll try you're talking about this
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
this piece but I thought it was a
 
03:39:39.389 --> 03:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
positive local impact because all the
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
other Trails were open and these are the
 
03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
trails that like tied them together kind
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
of thing potentially positive in that
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
regard but um the continued damage to
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
the trail becomes more expensive to
 
03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
maintain and then there's the impact on
 
03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
local inforcement um in terms of
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it is they do when they run
 
03:39:58.710 --> 03:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
into okay themselves I thought there was
 
03:40:00.510 --> 03:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
some conflict with like hunting seasons
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
or something and that's a conflict with
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
hun hunting so maybe fees or permits or
 
03:40:05.469 --> 03:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
but there AR a lot of other trails that
 
03:40:08.189 --> 03:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
are that Vermont is open for that length
 
03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
of time so I think Crossing back and
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
fourth has become an issue where they
 
03:40:13.950 --> 03:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
can't cross into ver they Vermont is
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
open but main is open and New
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
think so so for what it's worth that
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill 127 extending the
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
closing date for the Connecticut River
 
03:40:34.030 --> 03:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
Headwaters to Columbus Day passed last
 
03:40:37.189 --> 03:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
week on the 13th it passed the house and
 
03:40:38.670 --> 03:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a second committee bill so it's
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
crossing over so the way I look at it is
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
this could be her first delete like you
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't excuse me you wouldn't need
 
03:40:46.030 --> 03:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
this I don't think you need it in House
 
03:40:47.229 --> 03:40:47.239 align:start position:0%
Bill too since you already have it
 
03:40:48.990 --> 03:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
passed somewhere else unless it's an
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
important enough thing to the house that
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
you want to also have it in your budget
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh the next big impact here for
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
division 2 is the video Lottery
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
Terminals and that's on page
 
03:41:07.279 --> 03:41:09.309 align:start position:0%
Terminals and that's on page
39

03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
39
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
um it also renames the Lottery
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
Commission to the lottery and gaming
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
commission which is interesting so we'll
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
have uh Lottery um walk through this
 
03:41:22.990 --> 03:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
with us I didn't see any significant
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
change to their budget like as far so we
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have to talk to them as far as
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
like their costs associated with this
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
and um how this could also impact other
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
games if that was considered for their
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
other traditional lottery games Revenue
 
03:41:37.710 --> 03:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
if there's this much coming is that
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
going to you know impact other games uh
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
so those would be good questions for
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
lottery when they come in Friday thank
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
you um does it happen because this is so
 
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
ways and means I'm uncomfortable with
 
03:41:52.349 --> 03:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
this can we refer this section can we
 
03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know I don't I don't know
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
delete the S can we get this to Ways and
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
Means instead of us because this really
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
is a ways means issue and not really I'm
 
03:42:03.229 --> 03:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with with division two
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
deciding and that is a past practice of
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
house finance is policy issues to send
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
them to the policy committees um so that
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for this and and
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
like we said earlier was it House Bill 7
 
03:42:17.149 --> 03:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
28 whatever it is that that could
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately end up being your house
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
position on this so whatever that
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
happens with that Bill maybe you copy
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
that language and just stick that in
 
03:42:26.229 --> 03:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill too as well that that could
 
03:42:27.910 --> 03:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
be ultimately where you end up so I know
 
03:42:29.910 --> 03:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
that is Chairman wier's goal with these
 
03:42:31.149 --> 03:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but maybe you could just
 
03:42:33.790 --> 03:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
remind me to talk to him to make sure
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
that he's aware this is one of those
 
03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
pieces that we like to in in our office
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
will when host Bill 2 the official House
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 is done we'll put together an
 
03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
index we'll be a little bit more
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
methodical with our division assignments
 
03:42:47.469 --> 03:42:47.479 align:start position:0%
and then we'll also recommend a policy
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee so if chairman Wier wants to
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
distribute you know for their review and
 
03:42:58.229 --> 03:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
past uh the next item is on page 42 the
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
northern Shield we heard the governor
 
03:43:06.349 --> 03:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
and her address speak speak to this this
 
03:43:08.349 --> 03:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
is kind of clunky language the way it's
 
03:43:11.469 --> 03:43:11.479 align:start position:0%
presented here that it says um the sums
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
of x amount of dollars are here you know
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
which have been appropriate in house
 
03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill one it's weird to have House Bill 2
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
referred to a house bill one but it's
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
fine I think this um account is on page
 
03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
366 of the the big budget book and
 
03:43:28.349 --> 03:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
3077 when the department of safety comes
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
in it's flipping pages and then we talk
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
about house bill to they'll clarify for
 
03:43:37.510 --> 03:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
us exactly what's going on here and um
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
where it is in the budget but I'm pretty
 
03:43:41.469 --> 03:43:41.479 align:start position:0%
sure that's where that that's located um
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the source of funds for this is
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh the opioid abatement trust fund right
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
yeah and you see that as agency income I
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
think in the budget yeah we've run into
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
I guess this concept before with the um
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol you know the the fund that's
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to help people who have a
 
03:44:05.830 --> 03:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
problem with alcohol and we've as far as
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
I recall we've never put as much money
 
03:44:10.389 --> 03:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
into that as we're supposed to this
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
seems similar to this is this language
 
03:44:14.670 --> 03:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
the same so that we're kind of you know
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
I suppose You could argue that it's a
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
baitman because we're going to have less
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
drugs in the state which is pretty you
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
know a silly argument um but do we run
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
into problems by taking and money from a
 
03:44:26.149 --> 03:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
fund that's supposed to be helping
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
people that have a substance abuse
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:34.030 --> 03:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
Shield just put up you could ask that
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
question to the department um it may be
 
03:44:39.309 --> 03:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
a better question for division three to
 
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
figure out with HHS um I'm not sure who
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
oversees that fund I think is probably
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
HHS s um but I I did look at the
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund report I think there was
 
03:44:52.189 --> 03:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
like at the end of fiscal 24 like over
 
03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
60 million in that fund so it must have
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
been looked at as a a source that they
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
could use and
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so am I correct that this is less
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
than the last bium didn't we spend 1.4
 
03:45:09.309 --> 03:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
Million last time this this is something
 
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
new I think that Granite Shield like
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
that old other program is still in there
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
too so when you get to those accounting
 
03:45:18.510 --> 03:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
units more flipping Pages we'll have to
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
have the department clarify what's
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
associated with which initiative thank
 
03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
you I was thinking I don't think this is
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah can you share with me what Granite
 
03:45:30.960 --> 03:45:32.229 align:start position:0%
yeah can you share with me what Granite
Shield

03:45:32.229 --> 03:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
Shield
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
is uh it's essentially a program that
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
was set up to have enhanced um drug
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Drug interdiction uh
 
03:45:44.550 --> 03:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
through the through overtime of existing
 
03:45:44.560 --> 03:45:45.469 align:start position:0%
through the through overtime of existing
Troop

03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
Troop
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
as well as the forensic lab I think has
 
03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
overtime that money that program has
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
money going to them too so was enhanced
 
03:45:55.469 --> 03:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
uh drug interdiction patrols and
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement that's a terrible
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
explanation from probably what the
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner will be able to explain
 
03:46:02.149 --> 03:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
much better so so but that's that's the
 
03:46:04.630 --> 03:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
gist of it and we've been doing that
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
Granite Shield's been in existence for
 
03:46:08.349 --> 03:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
several budgets now I think three three
 
03:46:16.149 --> 03:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.630 --> 03:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh the next is on page
 
03:46:22.229 --> 03:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
46 this is relative to the Dual and
 
03:46:22.239 --> 03:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
46 this is relative to the Dual and
concurrent

03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
concurrent
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment that adds that uh the courses
 
03:46:28.110 --> 03:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
would be up to four credits per course
 
03:46:29.910 --> 03:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
so there's also another bill it's a
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that also does something
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
quite similar to this I'm sorry House
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill one 190 193 yeah it's
 
03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
the lab bill I think yeah yeah so
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's that's another one we'll Monitor
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
and if a piece of legislation passes um
 
03:46:45.070 --> 03:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
especially one that I don't think has a
 
03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
whole lot of controversy you might be
 
03:46:49.229 --> 03:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
able to just have it especially since it
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a tie to the budget you
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
know so but yeah you could end up
 
03:46:54.990 --> 03:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
deleting this if that if you just want
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
to support that bill
 
03:46:57.840 --> 03:47:00.189 align:start position:0%
to support that bill
separately

03:47:00.189 --> 03:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
separately
 
03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:07.389 --> 03:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
54 so these are um department of
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
education related
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
sections um the first is the education
 
03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund law so so this is where um
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
statutorily um it's allowed to use
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
education trust funds for which
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
programs and what the governor's budget
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
did is um added the Dual and concurrent
 
03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment program as an allowable use
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund so in the
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
budget document house one you'll see
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
under community college system there's
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
$3 million a year appropriated for um
 
03:47:40.149 --> 03:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund it's not
 
03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
explicitly for that but I assume that's
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
the intent Shannon can verify that so
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's what that's for
 
03:47:47.550 --> 03:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is the statutory language
 
03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:48.750 align:start position:0%
um so this is the statutory language
enabling

03:47:48.750 --> 03:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
03:47:50.750 --> 03:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
that and just let you all know there's a
 
03:47:53.309 --> 03:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
bill coming out of Education funding as
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
well that does the same
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
thing um but there are more subsections
 
03:47:57.920 --> 03:47:59.429 align:start position:0%
thing um but there are more subsections
on

03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:48:03.630 --> 03:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
that uh section 18 page 54 it's that's
 
03:48:05.149 --> 03:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
not related to the community college
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
system but they're new bold text so I'm
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
wondering so the next the next one so Q
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
would be the cell phone grant that we
 
03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
talked about so that appropriation is
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
out of the education trust fund and then
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
there's uh something here added for
 
03:48:19.389 --> 03:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education operating costs
 
03:48:22.149 --> 03:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
in the budget we started this last year
 
03:48:24.149 --> 03:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
that there is an accounting unit for ETF
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
Administration which is I think
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
essentially relative to the data systems
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
associated with like adequacy and
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
everything so that's we'll have the
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
department explain that but I didn't see
 
03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
anything uh new as far as using the
 
03:48:36.990 --> 03:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for department
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
administration than what they're
 
03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
currently doing I think this is
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
a just a making it clear that they're
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to use the educ trust fund for
 
03:48:47.229 --> 03:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
administrative costs as budgeted they
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't have an open warrant for anything
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
like that it would only be what's
 
03:48:52.910 --> 03:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
budget um didn't we move special ed in
 
03:48:59.309 --> 03:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
already I think I will have to ask them
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
what's going on here this is it looks
 
03:49:03.149 --> 03:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
like they just cleaned up the language
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
around episod of treatments so and and
 
03:49:08.429 --> 03:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
corrected a reference perhaps so we had
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
Corder placement separate from episod of
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
treatments and it looks like they just
 
03:49:17.149 --> 03:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
um clarified those two stat statutes
 
03:49:20.189 --> 03:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't look like anything new
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
was done it looks like a cleanup of what
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
we did last
 
03:49:27.389 --> 03:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
year the next couple sections um we can
 
03:49:29.309 --> 03:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
have the department explain the
 
03:49:32.349 --> 03:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
specifics but my understanding is they
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
are somewhat housekeeping relative to
 
03:49:36.630 --> 03:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools VX and then uh
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
something relative to um adequacy with
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
19841 that third uh paragraph here um
 
03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't change any grants going
 
03:49:47.149 --> 03:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
out doesn't change any budgets these are
 
03:49:50.550 --> 03:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
just um things that uh the Department of
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
Education said they just needed to clean
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
up some existing statutes to align with
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:03.229 --> 03:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
grants so moving right along the next
 
03:50:07.189 --> 03:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.990 --> 03:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
62 relative to police standards and
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
training and this is also in a separate
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill uh House Bill 778 does something
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
quite similar to this which is to allow
 
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
for the police standards and training uh
 
03:50:24.670 --> 03:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Specialists employed to
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
take detail coverages if they were
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
available so there'd be no cost here I
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
don't think to the state in that I think
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
we we have a billable rate to whoever is
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
requesting the detailed service but this
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
would essentially enable police
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council certain
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
employees to serve those detail shifts
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
if they are available and like I said
 
03:50:46.189 --> 03:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 778 does the same thing uh I
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
don't see a budget impact here so that's
 
03:50:49.950 --> 03:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
another bill will track and you may not
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
tube uh we can ask them I think we have
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
police standards in next Monday I think
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
in uh Department of Safety um they've
 
03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
got a few things going on here not all
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
of which I'm quite clear with what
 
03:51:12.070 --> 03:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing but we'll get those
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
explanations uh the first thing you
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
remember the fire fund has been uh an
 
03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
unhealthy dedicated fund here for a
 
03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
couple of budgets uh they projected a $4
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
million deficit for this next upcoming
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
two years the governor actually
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated $4 million in general funds
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
in that account to get them through for
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
two years um what this section here does
 
03:51:36.149 --> 03:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
this first paragraph says any unspent
 
03:51:37.870 --> 03:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
general funds at the end of the year
 
03:51:39.389 --> 03:51:39.399 align:start position:0%
would just lapse to the fire fund
 
03:51:40.830 --> 03:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
instead of lapsing back to the general
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
fund so it's a way to make sure that
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
fund gets the benefit of that whole for
 
03:51:46.189 --> 03:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
million even if they don't spend it all
 
03:51:48.269 --> 03:51:48.279 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
03:51:48.279 --> 03:51:49.870 align:start position:0%
in the first
year

03:51:49.870 --> 03:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
okay the next couple of items we we
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
actually had director morasco from DMV
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
here today he probably could have
 
03:51:57.469 --> 03:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
answered the questions but we'll we'll
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
ask him when they come in they relative
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
to uh um driver's licenses and history
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh record checks so we'll ask the
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
department the necessity for those and
 
03:52:08.349 --> 03:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
what impact they
 
03:52:11.349 --> 03:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
have um at the bottom of that page um
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
emergency services and Communications it
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
looks like this here is intended to
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
expand the use of the e911 fund to cover
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
State Radio communication systems so
 
03:52:22.349 --> 03:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
we'll have to ask the
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
department um how the budget reflects
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
this change here and what the purpose of
 
03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:30.950 align:start position:0%
this change here and what the purpose of
this

03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
is um and that that comes from the e911
 
03:52:33.520 --> 03:52:39.189 align:start position:0%
is um and that that comes from the e911
search

03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
charge the next section relative to this
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
says division of fire safety so this
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
this paragraph and then the last
 
03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph on the next page before it
 
03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
gets into State Treasury it looks like
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
they've identified two positions in the
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety that are not group
 
03:52:58.149 --> 03:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
one that they're trying to reclassify as
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
group two depending on the member who's
 
03:53:03.309 --> 03:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
taken that position so we'll let the
 
03:53:06.110 --> 03:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
department uh speak to the necessity for
 
03:53:06.120 --> 03:53:10.269 align:start position:0%
department uh speak to the necessity for
those

03:53:10.269 --> 03:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
and then that paragraph in between we'll
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
have to ask the department also it's
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
relative to um div division of what's
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
that yeah wheelchair is a division of
 
03:53:27.389 --> 03:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
fire reading wondering what that was
 
03:53:29.229 --> 03:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
about so we'll get more yeah I don't
 
03:53:30.750 --> 03:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a budget impact here it's got
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be something that they're just trying
 
03:53:33.910 --> 03:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
to clean up a statute so we'll we'll get
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
a better explanation from the Department
 
03:53:35.399 --> 03:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
a better explanation from the Department
on

03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:41.950 --> 03:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
that so the
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
last thing I have and it's an easy one
 
03:53:45.670 --> 03:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
69 Lottery
 
03:53:47.760 --> 03:53:49.469 align:start position:0%
69 Lottery
Commission

03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
so there's been boilerplate language in
 
03:53:54.670 --> 03:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
the back of house bill 2 that has this
 
03:53:56.910 --> 03:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
same language for years that's relative
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
to um new games or expansion of games
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
and um getting fiscal committee approval
 
03:54:05.670 --> 03:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
for transfers associated with that this
 
03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
kind of continues on to the next page uh
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
says that the such transfer shall not
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
exceed $15 million uh under current law
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
that exists but it's only $6 million
 
03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
so it really increases that threshold
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
what the what the governor is proposing
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
here my sense is it's VT related but
 
03:54:24.349 --> 03:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
we'll ask Lottery about that and then
 
03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
furthermore um this should be in house
 
03:54:28.510 --> 03:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill one in the back of house bill one
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll probably delete it from House
 
03:54:32.189 --> 03:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
Bill two whatever you decide to do with
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
the language and then we'll put in the
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
back of house bill one can you speak of
 
03:54:40.149 --> 03:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
what this achieves I was I was trying to
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
come up with some the 15 million yeah
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
you shall not exceed um I just was
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
completely lost as to I don't know what
 
03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
it does yeah we'll have to ask the
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
department when they've really utilized
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
this over the last few years and for
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
what reasons but my understanding is
 
03:54:58.030 --> 03:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
when they during a a year or after a
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
budget's passed if they're expanding or
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
adding a game or doing anything there's
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
a special revenue account that they
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
could draw from that um through the year
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
for that purpose with fiscal approval um
 
03:55:12.070 --> 03:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
but like I said I I can't really recall
 
03:55:13.830 --> 03:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
how frequent it's been or the last time
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
so um but like I said the big change
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
here is going from 6 million to 15
 
03:55:18.990 --> 03:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
million so there's got to be a reason
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
for that or expectation of what's coming
 
03:55:23.229 --> 03:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what my that's my must be
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
expensive to get it started yeah so when
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
when the Lottery Commission comes in we
 
03:55:29.070 --> 03:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
can ask them about that but like I said
 
03:55:30.670 --> 03:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
I would recommend not having this in
 
03:55:32.149 --> 03:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill two and we'll put it in the
 
03:55:33.429 --> 03:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
back of house bill one whatever you
 
03:55:35.229 --> 03:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
decide on with the language and I can
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
imagine it could be a cash flow thing as
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
well just in terms of sure Lottery and
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
somebody wins big that kind of thing I'm
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
sure they need startup funds like this
 
03:55:45.309 --> 03:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
is what was the discussion if you
 
03:55:48.429 --> 03:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
remember during the Cannabis uh
 
03:55:50.110 --> 03:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
discussions uh when it was coming
 
03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
through the house that they needed cash
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
to get the program running and it so you
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
know you have to invest a bit to get the
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.269 --> 03:56:04.279 align:start position:0%
guess so that's all I've got with the
 
03:56:07.269 --> 03:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
trailer bill um but at least to give you
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
a little sense of what's in there and
 
03:56:10.349 --> 03:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully a little bit more prepared
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
when the agencies do come in um to
 
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on there they'll
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
they will all be instructed to be
 
03:56:18.910 --> 03:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
prepared to go through this with us with
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
their related sections
 
03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:26.630 align:start position:0%
their related sections
so

03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
um I didn't really have anything else
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond I mean I could have pointed out
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
some things in house bill one like what
 
03:56:35.710 --> 03:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's decision was on certain
 
03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
funding certain programs we're going to
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
get to those with the agencies I don't
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
know how much you really want to do
 
03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
today um but other than that I can
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure the people coming
 
03:56:55.590 --> 03:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
in can answer the question um I was
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
taken aack uh with the basically the $10
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
million cut to the university system I'm
 
03:57:01.950 --> 03:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
really happy for the community colleges
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
who want to hang on to that as best we
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
can but I don't think the university is
 
03:57:09.070 --> 03:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
going to have a good idea about why she
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
chose to cut that much and we saw that
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
there are a few capital projects to me
 
03:57:15.149 --> 03:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
that does not offset the $10 million cut
 
03:57:17.309 --> 03:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
to the university um do you have any
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
insight into the thinking around
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
that well I can tell you that that was
 
03:57:26.149 --> 03:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the agency budget yeah well that was
 
03:57:28.149 --> 03:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
that they came was that much yeah
 
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
because basically the as I understand
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
the former Governor asked for a
 
03:57:36.870 --> 03:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
4% cut and I think that is that 4% cut
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's what that represents I believe
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
and we also have somebody here who might
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
be able to even though she's not with
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
una she might be able to speak to that
 
03:57:44.510 --> 03:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
particular question do you have to know
 
03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:46.750 align:start position:0%
particular question do you have to know
what

03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:46.760 --> 03:57:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay it's only un yeah and I'm pretty
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
sure that's what the university system
 
03:57:59.910 --> 03:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
the system and and what's the other one
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
great but I'm pretty sure that's what
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
the chancellor told us when we met with
 
03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
her that that's what it was represented
 
03:58:10.349 --> 03:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:17.630 --> 03:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
think hacks is really think we I've got
 
03:58:22.439 --> 03:58:23.710 align:start position:0%
think hacks is really think we I've got
one

03:58:23.710 --> 03:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
Mickey um when I was flipping through
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
the book it looks like building Aid he
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
only paying on The Debt Service and the
 
03:58:34.510 --> 03:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
governor did
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
not um include any additional monies
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
outside Debt Service so that you know
 
03:58:39.880 --> 03:58:41.229 align:start position:0%
outside Debt Service so that you know
was

03:58:41.229 --> 03:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
about 31 or 30 the first fiscal year and
 
03:58:50.189 --> 03:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
32 the second fiscal year of million
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
that was not put towards building Aid is
 
03:58:55.229 --> 03:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
that right uh yeah so the governor's
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
position on school building Aid is
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
essentially no new projects for two
 
03:59:01.349 --> 03:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
years so it would be um just paying the
 
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
tail and paying The Debt Service on the
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
bonds that we issued that's in
 
03:59:06.269 --> 03:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
treasury's budget so it's just paying
 
03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
those uh payments on the past approve
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
projects there is $5 million a year for
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund um
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
in here but the Traditional School
 
03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
building aid program it appears would be
 
03:59:23.110 --> 03:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh no new projects for two years yep yep
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
and uh special education Aid you you
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
heard her talk about that uh so we had a
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate approximately what 34
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
million uh this budget is like around
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
$49 a. half million per year so that is
 
03:59:36.720 --> 03:59:37.870 align:start position:0%
$49 a. half million per year so that is
essentially

03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
where um fiscal 25's estimate was was
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
around $50 million so it's essentially
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
carrying that number for 26 and 27
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's no changes to House Bill 2
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
relative to the pration or um an open
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
warrant or anything like that but House
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
Bill one does have a higher than
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
traditional level of funding at least
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
for cat Aid special education Aid yeah
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
so it was it's like the old catastrophic
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
Aid whatever they call it special ed Aid
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:09.600 --> 04:00:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay there was no like uh um you know I
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
remember last by him there was a
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
discussion of like the
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
tiered uh reimbursement rates that
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not here because it's
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
not current law and um is there
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
currently a bill still going through or
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
did it add funding did
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
that did that get um okay top my yeah
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of bills yes many so I'm
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
trying to remember which ones are left
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we're still considering but yes
 
04:00:44.830 --> 04:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
we're definitely probably gonna have one
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
in each of the different
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
categories there's a bill I think with
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
an open warrant for cat Aid one that
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
changes the pration to be no less than
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
85% I think was another one right
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of them and then we're
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
try to whittle it down I think to to
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
four is what representative lad said in
 
04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
terms of sort of covering each of the
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
topics but we have not gotten to the
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.510 --> 04:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh blanket thing you want
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
every agency to come in with like is
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
there something you want me to have them
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
all prepared to talk about or
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
present no but leave that question on
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
the table um one thing that um Mickey
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
had advised me was as a newbie um would
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
be helpful to do in preparation is to
 
04:01:43.229 --> 04:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
look through have the the handouts they
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
gave us when they were here and tie
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
those into you're looking at the budget
 
04:01:48.990 --> 04:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
things that'll give us some insight into
 
04:01:50.950 --> 04:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on if that makes sense I
 
04:01:52.910 --> 04:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good suggestion so
 
04:01:54.630 --> 04:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
I'll let other people answer your your
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
your question you just asked if you want
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
again well you know this is a different
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
climate right now but they used to come
 
04:02:06.990 --> 04:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
in with um priorities things that they
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
really need and I don't even know if
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's would that be insulting to even
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
ask them to come into priorities when
 
04:02:15.149 --> 04:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
basically what we're looking at is a
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
starvation budget so I don't
 
04:02:20.349 --> 04:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
know but just be aware you you can see
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
those the agency budget requests um have
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
them in there if you want to go through
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
there which i' I've looked at that as
 
04:02:25.520 --> 04:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
there which i' I've looked at that as
well

04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah part part of our general thing that
 
04:02:31.469 --> 04:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
we usually that I usually ask them to
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
come in with is any significant changes
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
one way or another with the budget from
 
04:02:38.429 --> 04:02:38.439 align:start position:0%
previous year as well as any changes you
 
04:02:40.110 --> 04:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
would like division two to consider so
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
if there are any prioritize needs or
 
04:02:44.830 --> 04:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
things they you know after their
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
discussions with the governor are still
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
wanting to pursue they they should
 
04:02:50.349 --> 04:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully know to you know put those as
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
part of their presentation but I was
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
just thinking a line on the lines of any
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
sort of information you wanted everyone
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
to come in with to be ready with like
 
04:02:59.149 --> 04:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
but if if you think of something just
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
shoot it in an email and well one thing
 
04:03:04.389 --> 04:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
would would be um dedicated funds that
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
might be applicable to their accounts
 
04:03:08.070 --> 04:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
and I think we did get some of that
 
04:03:10.149 --> 04:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up information and I posted it to
 
04:03:12.030 --> 04:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
the division 2 website so I think
 
04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're I think they're all planning on
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
when they come in especially when you
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
start flipping Pages you'll you'll
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
revisit those
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
um the one I was thinking of is uh
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
because we talked about even earlier
 
04:03:26.349 --> 04:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
today is positions as far as funded
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
versus unfunded for instance just to at
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah oh sorry yeah I was just gonna
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
agree I just pushed my button in the
 
04:03:37.120 --> 04:03:38.429 align:start position:0%
agree I just pushed my button in the
wrong

04:03:38.429 --> 04:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:03:41.309 --> 04:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
direction so I think I think that is a
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
worthy discussion for the Departments
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
when they come in since a fair amount of
 
04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
them of you know how many um vacancies
 
04:03:51.910 --> 04:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
are now being like cut or whatever uh
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
not just un you know unfilled is that
 
04:03:57.070 --> 04:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
what they call it unfilled unfunded uned
 
04:03:59.229 --> 04:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so I mean it might be worth
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
having them each describe like what was
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
the before number and where are we at
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.710 --> 04:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
happened just to follow up on that um
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that separate from the high rank
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
freeze that's going on
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
now you those empty
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
positions so I I would say if they've
 
04:04:28.590 --> 04:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
got empty positions today they're
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
subject to the executive order for the
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
hiring free there was certain carbots
 
04:04:35.070 --> 04:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
and and waiver but but yeah that that is
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
another layer to this is you know if the
 
04:04:39.550 --> 04:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
governor is got a directive relative to
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
filling positions one does this budget
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
the big book already account for a lot
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
of that unfunded them or is there an
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
expectation that hiring freeze or or
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
that that Freez is only through this
 
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
year and then starting in 26 it's you
 
04:04:55.830 --> 04:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't know so but good
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
questions for the agency if they've been
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.309 --> 04:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
not yeah I mean I have to go back I
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
guess just some of the discussions this
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
morning of where you know we're looking
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
at a very meager budget I think it's
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
considered you know a starvation budget
 
04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
and then we saw this morning of bills
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
which would be a heavier lift would
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
increase the work load on somebody
 
04:05:20.830 --> 04:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
potentially someone that they're not
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
going to be able to hire and I would
 
04:05:23.950 --> 04:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
hope that we would keep some of those
 
04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
considerations in mind when we're
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
considering these bills because on the
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
one hand yes it'd be great to do this on
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
the other hand we're not going to allow
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
good idea so thank you Mr landrian and
 
04:06:42.510 --> 04:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.520 --> 04:07:12.510 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.520 --> 04:07:42.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
