00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure who's in camera
 
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
land right
 
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
now on this but I'm not I'm not going to
 
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
hold this up because of a because of of
 
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 align:start position:0%
a remote camera that's a remote camera
 
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
well because of the cameras yeah so all
 
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
right so I'm G to get creative here I'm
 
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.110 align:start position:0%
going to
open

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing on House Bill 2712
 
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
71 is a it deals with the licensing
 
00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensed Social Work
 
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
Associates now the to remind everybody
 
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
the crusp of this was to remove exam
 
00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
lure we learned in testimony that
 
00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
the exam requirement was instituted just
 
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
back in 20
 
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
21 uh it's it's still in its infancy
 
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
really and um we had you know testimony
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
um both in favor of removing
 
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
removing one of the concerns that I have
 
00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
I'll open I'll just open up the
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
is we just in 2021 created the
 
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 align:start position:0%
this it's really not had much of an
 
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get off the ground yet so
 
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
um when you have when you're when you're
 
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.869 align:start position:0%
um when you have when you're when you're
granting

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
granting
 
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.630 align:start position:0%
granting
lure

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
lure
 
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
to someone that comes with some
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
connotations some
 
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
expectations of of certain
 
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
things and
 
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
typically when you're license to do
 
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
something you've met some sort of
 
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.589 align:start position:0%
something you've met some sort of
criteria

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
so I have
 
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
reservations in
 
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation because of that factor
 
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm curious as to what my
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues are thinking as well so I'll
 
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
open it up
 
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
groda thank you uh Mr chair so I agree
 
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
that when you have lure or you're
 
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
licensed to do something you should have
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
some way of measuring your um your
 
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
capability so that it meets
 
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
lure there
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
was I found that the testimony in
 
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
support of the bill was not
 
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.149 align:start position:0%
support of the bill was not
strong

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
because I got
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
conflicting it was it I am flicted as to
 
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is
 
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
supervision or a clerical
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
position and
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
regardless we typically don't support
 
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.149 align:start position:0%
regardless we typically don't support
lenser

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
lenser
 
00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 align:start position:0%
without a measuring
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
insurance

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
coverage so I I need
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
some information and there's only is if
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
I if I remember correctly is there one
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
this does anybody have an IDE idea as to
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
why the bill that was passed a year ago
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
was oh I know why it was passed because
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have what I remember that
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
this was if my memory is correct this
 
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 align:start position:0%
bill was passed because we wanted
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
individuals to be licensed so that they
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
could these positions to be licensed so
 
00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
they could
 
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
have um uh reimbursement capabilities
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
from the insurance company and when they
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
put them in put this Licensing in they
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
gave it a
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
hurdle and the concern is that the
 
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
unachievable

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
unachievable
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
and is there data that that that I is
 
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
there data that shows
 
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe you can come up and talk and
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
but also introduce yourself
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
and we should probably have feel free to
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
come up um that's
 
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.870 align:start position:0%
come up um that's
okay

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
data uh one of the things that the
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the association of soci
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
social worker boards mentioned was that
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
due to the process of creating an exam
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
and going through all of that and
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
getting that all off the ground that's
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
only been in effect for six
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
months really so um and then that their
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
internal audit or their internal uh
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
question to their membership 78%
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
approved of of retaining the exam so
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's like I said was we're I
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't know the if we have enough data
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
here it's such it's such in its infancy
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
but but please provide what you
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
know is this on okay thank you chairman
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee my
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
name is Karina Bonia I work for caror
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
blue Strat IES um and John dejoy
 
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
representing the nasw New Hampshire who
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
brought this bill
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
forward so as mentioned there's only one
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
person in New Hampshire at the moment
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
who has an
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
lswa um so we don't have much data on
 
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.029 align:start position:0%
lswa um so we don't have much data on
what

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
the the pass or fail rate is for the
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
exam at this moment but what we do know
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
is that right now what it calls for is
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are getting their Li
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
Social Work associate to take the exam
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
that's for the licensed social workers
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
and so the difference between those two
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
levels is that individuals who are
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
getting their licens their lssw who are
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
licensed as an license social work those
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
individuals have a bachelor's of social
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
work from an accredited institution
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who are getting their
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
licensed Social Work associate have a
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
bachelors's in some other fields other
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
than social work or an associates degree
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
in some human resources related field so
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
for an LSW someone with no formal Social
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
Work education from an accredited
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
institution to take that LSW licensure
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
exam that's where we expect um and
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will be
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
some some difficulty in passing that
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
exam we even know that with the LSW exam
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of individuals who
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
have a bachelor of social work from an
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
accredited institution who are still not
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
passing that exam and so we anticipate
 
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
that someone with no formal Social Work
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
education from an accredited University
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
will also find that to be a significant
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
lswa

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
lswa
 
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative long go for it uh so
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
I guess since they're different jobs
 
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
how relevant is the material on the
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
licensed social work exam to what LSW
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
are actually doing dayto day yeah so as
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative long as something with
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
the lswa and the exam is that you'll see
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
in the requirements for an lswa it's not
 
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
just the lure exam there's also 30 hours
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
of required training as well as a
 
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
significant number of of train um
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
supervised hours with your
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
supervisor and the reason for that the
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
reason of those 30 hours of required
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
training is because if you have if
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
you're called a licensed Social Work
 
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
associate yet you don't have a formal
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
Social Work education it's important
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
that you understand the social work
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
field and what it means to have that
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
title and so in that 30 hours of
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
training those LS swas are getting
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
critical education into Social Work
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
competencies in the social work
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
education the roles of these individuals
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
are really in roles case
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
managers and so when you think about
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
social work as a field and the positions
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
of these individuals any person who's
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing direct service and um human
 
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.470 align:start position:0%
doing direct service and um human
engagement

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
is you know essentially overlapping with
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
what the social work profession stands
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
for and what our what our values
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
are you know like working with people
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
engaging with community members if
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
you're a case manager and you're working
 
00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:07.959 align:start position:0%
in a department that provides
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
Clin um that provides essential
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
resources to someone you're working with
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
a Community member it's important you
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
know the social work values of community
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
engagement working with Community those
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
values are essentially there but no CL
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
you don't have any Social Work education
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
hi hi
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
so we need to talk in more concrete
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
terms because this kind of yeah you're
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're saying that a a license
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
associate expectation to pass this Lo
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
the social
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
worker uh professional test okay
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker test is too high
 
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.629 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker test is too high
a

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
bar do you have data that shows that or
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have any do you have anybody
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
who applied for that licensed social
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
worker associate and where they were
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
unable to pass the test I do not have
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
that data right now okay so I think that
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have y and then if
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
we have don't you think I think that
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have and if you
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that or for some reason that
 
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.509 align:start position:0%
don't have that or for some reason that
doesn't

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
exist um there has to be
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
something other
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
than just checking off a bunch of boxes
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
and saying okay you're certified to be
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
an lswa you want so I would I'm willing
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
to um entertain a
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
discussion and some feedback from the
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker group that would
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
say okay this this doesn't work but this
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
would we just can't have a
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
certification I don't believe without
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
something that shows that you're capable
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
certification to mean that doesn't
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of a
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
certification or a license she says that
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
you were able to do this thing does that
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
make sense to you yes that makes sense
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that the intent is the 30
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
hours of training as well as the
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
significant numbers of supervision and
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
individuals with an lswa would never be
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
working unsupervised they would always
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
be working supervised by a licens
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker or
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
another supervisor who's able to oversee
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
their work they would never be working
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
independently without
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
supervision and where is that
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
written let me confirm for you I will
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
confirm where that is written while
 
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that I'm uh I spent a
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
lot of time in Academia I have an
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
engineering degree I did graduate work
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
at Oklahoma State University I have a
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
master's degree I so what I I try
 
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.310 align:start position:0%
master's degree I so what I I try
to

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
balance different types
 
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.670 align:start position:0%
balance different types
of

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
educational Adventures okay 30 hours is
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
a 4-day
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
balancing that and I appreciate the
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
Apprentice part of part of what you're
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
saying I maybe it's an old term we're
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
not using anymore but that's kind of
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
um as far as working
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
the watchful eye of of someone
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
else um that is
 
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
else um that is
um

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
very agency
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
dependent right I mean the watchful eye
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
is varies okay
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
and the the concept of lure does bring
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
on certain public expect ations whether
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
they are real or not right now as a as a
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
wonderful example we all have a dri most
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
of us have a driver's license right well
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean we're all
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
very good at driving so um so so
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes that can go a little bit of
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
skew but when it comes to Professional
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
Licensing I think we do have a little
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
so I think that you might have a point
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
here in five
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
years when you actually have some data
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
and you're not trying to repeal
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
something that has been in effect for
 
00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:12.829 align:start position:0%
something that has been in effect for
six

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
months I think that's that's the hangup
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
right now so
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
um I mean that that's that's where I'm
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
leaning with this and and I can see why
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
the association of social worker boards
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
opposes this I I get what they're saying
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
um now if if this type of work
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
was was modified out of the word license
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
into something else then I think a
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
discussion could be had there
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
but that that term puts you at a certain
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
level now with that we talked about the
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
compact right because
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
compacts oh yeah there is there is a
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
compact so we've we''ve
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
had compacts in New Hampshire that have
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
worked out okay we've had a couple that
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
have been Absolute Total disasters for
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so every time that we get
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
into the weeds sideb barring compact
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
which I know there was some discussions
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
I asked the question about the
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
compact we now it appears there's not
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
consistency between states in this
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
compact as far as those things that
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
really gets my blood pressure up on on
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
the concept of a compact that does not
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
have uniformity across its
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
membership because now we are allowing
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
in theory someone to come in or we're
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
exporting someone right because
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're doing hopefully New
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's contributing right where the
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
the playing field is not as questionable
 
00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
the playing field is not as questionable
here

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's just too early it's
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
just that simple it's just too early to
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
to pull the plug on this um until we we
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
can have something tangible to show
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
not and I'd love to hear what Glenn
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
so in reference to competency which I
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
think is what you're getting at right I
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
mean showing competency without
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
education versus showing Education
 
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.750 align:start position:0%
education versus showing Education
Without

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
Without
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
competency I think the default is to
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
lean towards competency regardless of
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
how you get it people learn differently
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
here and again requirements of
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
educational the bachelor's degree
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
requirement is a is a broad one right
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's because you can be in the field or
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
outside the field right you can have a
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in another practice to
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
get an lswa yep yep okay so it means
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a bachelor's degree
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
in social work and you obviously don't
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
have a masters in social work clearly
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
ybody did not the UC I'd say you would
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
not be as good because you fa because
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
the other person failed it I mean we
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
don't write the exam the legislature
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't dictate the contents of that
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
board yeah
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely representative gr thank
 
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.789 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely representative gr thank
you

00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
so it is not
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
unusual that in our
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
licensing levels we have associate
 
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.070 align:start position:0%
licensing levels we have associate
levels

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
and uh the level above whatever that is
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
associate the I'm remembering also the
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
level is not one
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
that as that often people leave that
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
level to go to the next level because in
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
order is that right yes you cannot I
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
remember this did come up um in our
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
initial public hearing about if this is
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
a stepping stone and it's really not you
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
cannot become you cannot go from being
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
an lswa to an lssw or from an lswa to an
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
LCSW without the education so to go from
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
an lswa to an LCSW you would need to
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
have a m you need to have a bachelor's
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
degree at least and then you would need
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
to get your masters in social work um so
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
this is a step Stone in the way of when
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
you have a license it's empowering and
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
you might go on to receive a formal
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
Social Work education and then aim for
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
other lur teers but there is no way to
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
go from being an LSW to then get a
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
promotion and now you've moved
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
up sure and that that representative
 
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.950 align:start position:0%
up sure and that that representative
long

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
so as have two questions first is there
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
some other exam that might be a better
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
fit for this position that could be
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
required instead or some practical
 
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.789 align:start position:0%
required instead or some practical
skills

00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
skills
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
that might need to be
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrated uh and then I guess you
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
know I'm interested in the idea of doing
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
something other than a license if that
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
would help but I guess what is what do
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies actually
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
require um in order to get reimbursed is
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
there some alternative available that
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
would actually fit that fill that need
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
so the original creation I'm I'm not
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
sure what the insurance companies need
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
the actual original bringing in of the
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
LSW and lswa tiers was done without the
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
nasw's um buyin uh we didn't find out
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
about it until after the amendment was
 
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.950 align:start position:0%
about it until after the amendment was
passed

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
so those tiers were sort of created with
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
new Futures with the intention of
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
billing first services to these
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who are doing this essential
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
work that's mirroring Social Work type
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
of Engagement um and giving it that like
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
adding those additional lured tiers but
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
that was not done with the N
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
nasw's um buyin so I'm not sure what the
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
requirements are necessarily
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
for to for the insurance companies and
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be reimbursed and build um and then
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
you can you remind me of your other
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
question representative long
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
so my other question was whether there's
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
some other test that might be a better
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
fit for the position whether it's an
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
academic test or practical skills test
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh that would actually just be more
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
relevant to what people in this position
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
are doing um and maybe less of a barrier
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
to people who are actually qualified for
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
it yeah I think um that would be a
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
really great road to go down and
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to consider I'm not sure what
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
that would look like exactly or what
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
that might exactly be I think um part of
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
that proving that you're able to do the
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
work is before you're licensed you're
 
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
doing the work always in supervision
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
even after you're licensed but before
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
you become licensed if you have a
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
bachelor's you have to do I'm looking at
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
the facts so that I'm telling you
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
exactly the truth if you have a
 
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor's you would do 4,000 hours
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
supervised before even being licensed as
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
an lswa and if you have your Associates
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
that would be 6,000 supervised hours
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
before ever even being licensed and I
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
think that what we talked about earlier
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
is to really ensure that you are
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
competent in the work and able to do
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
this prior to lure and then once
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
licensed you would continue to be
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
work okay
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
so so there's nobody here from oplc that
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
I thought I thought it was you I said I
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
think that's that's so could we ask you
 
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.549 align:start position:0%
think that's that's so could we ask you
a

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
you so where is this these hours
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
documented the the hours that she
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
mentions as far as hours of supervision
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
or the hours of apparently there are
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
other other than this test in order to
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
become a licensed social worker
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
associate yep you need hours of
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
something yes that it would that's in
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements for lure so I don't I
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the mechanics I could get
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
back to you on is that tracked directly
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
is it just an attestation I did it is it
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
a form that fills out the required hours
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
there um I I don't have the mechanics in
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
front of me but I could get that for you
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you yeah
 
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.789 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you yeah
totally

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
totally
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
is there any any other contexts that you
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
need from
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
me no I mean other than you know again
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
meddling in a profession that has a
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
compact and I am
 
00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.430 align:start position:0%
compact and I am
always

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
always
hesitant

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
hesitant
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
to you got to be careful right because
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to join a compact which has
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
conditions and requirements and
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
expectations and
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
and you know that's that's one of the
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
reason there are people that do not like
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
entering into compacts because you have
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
to now tiptoe a little bit and you know
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
the the consistency issue with this exam
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward during the
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing was problematic to me
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
right from the get-go in the fact that a
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
compact's been created that that has a
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that is not NE
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily in well it's not even that
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
it's not enforced it's that it's it may
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
or may not be required depending on the
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
state that's in the compact so and I'm
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
not here to to litigate the Compact and
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
this deficiency that I think exists
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
within the compact right because with
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
other compacts you have you know Bam Bam
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
Bam Bam Bam this is what we require all
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
the way across the board and so when
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
we're getting someone from another state
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
we have a minimum level of expectation
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
and vice versa this exam seems to fall
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
those requirements where some states
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
want it some states don't so in the
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
interest of keeping a
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
bar for New
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at at a better
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
level in the infancy of this I I'm very
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
very hesitant to start changing what
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
we've what we've done what we've agreed
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
to God bless you at the beginning so you
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
oplc has to run you guys have got to
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
manage this compact you have to manage
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
the all of this
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of why you have to
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
show up to these yeah I can I can take a
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of a step back and just kind
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
of talk through so I think I think the
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
origin of this particular piece of
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
legislation you're considering is
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
because um and I think you alluded a
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
little bit to the the fact that the some
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the movement legislatively when it
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
was passed was um it was not as robust a
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement as it might have
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
been and so I think there were some
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who would have liked to be
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
included and to say hey do we do we want
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
the same Examination for this level of
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
lure as for the next one up so if you
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
have like a master's level social worker
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
and then you have a bachelor's level and
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
then you have this which is an associate
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
or some kind of alternate
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
piece should there not
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
be the the rigor and the level of
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
examination or competency would be
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
different for those three and I think
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
what they're saying is that having it be
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the same for the bachelor's level as for
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
this other one is um I think that's the
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
concern now I again I don't have metrics
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
I can't weigh in on that but I think
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's the piece of it and I think um
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's possible that discussion would have
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
been had before this bill was passed in
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
that time to say is this the mo most
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to measure that
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
competency um and then I was going to
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
address your compact piece just a a
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
little bit to say um generally the way
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
that compacts are are working is you if
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire enters the social work
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
compact you can get a compact license
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
but you don't have to right so you you
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
can have a compact license with
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
standards but you you don't have to get
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
a compact license so the standards for
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for an regular New
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license can stay so I don't I
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
I understand that well in my ideal World
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be two different criteria
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
right just in terms of administration
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
but but there could be and and that
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
would be okay so um just a few things to
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
chew on so
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
board it sounds like the if the Board
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
needs to create an exam for that level
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
right if if they have an exam that's
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's far above that's kind of outside
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
their world then it sounds to me like
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
the Board needs to address that and
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
right because we don't dictate the
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
contents of the exam that's that's not
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
what we do here what we're discussing is
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
whether an exam exists or exists or not
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank God we don't write them right we
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do that holy crap
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
right we don't know what we're doing
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
with that but
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's the idea it's the go no go
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
idea do do we have a license or do we
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
not so you know I I think it's clear
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
that there seems to be a need for it but
 
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
if the if the exam to get to that is
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
just not appropriate let's address that
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
that is outside the scope of of us that
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's a the board that's involved with
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
that will need to do that and if and if
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
they can come come up with something
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
that and bring people together and say
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is more in tune to
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
what we do then when you've done it come
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature and make
 
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.990 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature and make
whatever

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
tweaks need to be made if if at all then
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
that might be more
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh I the board is not going to
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
develop an exam without the legislative
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
authority to develop exam and give it so
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
unless you say there needs to be this
 
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
level exam developed that it's not going
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
to happen so we could but it might be in
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
a I don't we're not the boards do write
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
questions for some exams but many of
 
00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
them are National exams so it might be
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
more of a national piece to say we we
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
need an assessment that's appropriate
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
that is standard across the board I
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if that exists at that level
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to share the table with my
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
colleague here if if we'd like to have
 
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
that discussion but um so I have a
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion yeah what we could do is we
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
can write legislation that gives the
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
authority to the board to write the
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
making which we we could do that and
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
then they would have to bring those
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
rules to they'd have a hearing and that
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
input and then it could be whatever they
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
decide is the right criteria for so it
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
gives the board the authority to do that
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
in rule making so it could just say an
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
ex the perhaps a statutory change could
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
just be a little bit more generic about
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
an exam and not name the specific exam
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
and then create the ru making authority
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
to develop or even have to be an exam
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
we're just giving you the CR the
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
authority to write the criteria in rule
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
making you can be whatever you want it
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be I it can't be you know just just
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
know that there has to be something M
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
right I and uh maybe it would be helpful
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee if I um if I Just
 
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
sh I mean I I could go back to my
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
computer and probably pull it up and
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
share the criteria that already is in
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
rule for this to take a look there I
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if when you're
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
planning to make a decision or um the
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
bring it back to full committee but I I
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
could get you some information about
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
what's already in rule for for
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately this this the subcommittee
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
will bring forward things to the full
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee to discuss within the
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
executive session okay so that there's
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
but I
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
would the way I would write enabling Le
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
legislation in the event that it is
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to create or
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
adopt right because again we're not
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
asking anybody to reinvent the wheel
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
if the wheel already exists right and
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
that I mean the compact references
 
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.990 align:start position:0%
that I mean the compact references
already

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
references an exam so that's that's why
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
compacts get messy right so if the
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
compact already has an exam and you have
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
to take that exam to have a compact
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
license as we've as we know there's two
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
levels are we are we now forcing the
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
board to create something simply just to
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
when we don't necessarily need to and
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's okay so yeah and presently in the
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
in the law there's it does still have
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
meet other criteria as established by
 
00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:16.870 align:start position:0%
meet other criteria as established by
the

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
the
board

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
board
so

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that kind of gives that rule making
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
piece so what I'd like to do is pull and
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
see what we have listed in the rule
 
00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:28.070 align:start position:0%
see what we have listed in the rule
already

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
to to let you know what there is already
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
in place what those standards are um I
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
guess ASE
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
presently it does say pass pass a
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
national Proctor proctored examination
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
approved by the board and I think the
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
challenge is that there's there is no I
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
think the issue actually is that there
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
is no National exam for this level of
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
lure I I think that's the Crux of the
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
issue yeah uh also representative groda
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
it is chapter 330a a8c is the license
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
Social Work associate and at the bottom
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
it says a licensed Social Work associate
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
May engage in practice only under
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
clinical supervision of a licensed
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker a licensed mental
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
health counselor um and so that's where
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
it says concrete that even after
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
obtaining your lswa with your 3,000
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
hours you still may only practice under
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
the supervision of somebody who is
 
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:35.349 align:start position:0%
the supervision of somebody who is
licensed

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
and that's again looking can you use the
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
microphone because nobody out there can
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
hear you so
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
um so it s if they have meet other
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
criterias established by the board I I
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
think that gives them a green light on
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
that one um the but the requirement of
 
00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.349 align:start position:0%
that one um the but the requirement of
meeting

00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
this is what we run into in O you and I
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
talked about this before with other
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
boards having requirements listed for
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
things that either don't
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
exist right or have been modified so
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
much now they don't apply right so it
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're this is another one
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
where we're
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
just where if if that's the gig if
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's the requirement now that that's a
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
compact requirement though
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
not not not a New Hampshire requirement
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
I think what I would say is um it we're
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
not about Reinventing the wheel around
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
here I think literally when the
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
associate license was created it was a
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
copy and paste from the licensed
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker put it here same
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
thing so the I think the if I'm
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
adequately representing the position is
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
to say we we needed to do a little more
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
thinking than copying and pasting from
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
that same level because maybe this exam
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist maybe that level of
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
testing is not required for this type of
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
work because it is under supervision at
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
all times so uh I can Implement whatever
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
you give me but presently I can issue a
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
license without an exam for this level
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
with the statute as it currently stands
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like that the direction is
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
clear here that coming come up with what
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
needs to exist and then come to us and
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
we'll change it okay we're not going to
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
dump it and then hope that something
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
gets enacted I'll leave that to my
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
lobbyist Nationals a friends I don't you
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
don't want me in the business of doing
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
that but yes I I as a director you don't
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
do that no no no yes but you see what
 
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I see what you're saying yes
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
is before before we eliminate the exam
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's measures in place
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that individuals getting an
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
lswa have a process in place
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
to confirm their competency and make
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they're able to do the job
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
before we eliminate something violating
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
the compact
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
y I mean this is and you got to convince
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
the board to do this right this is this
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
is why oplc exists this is why we have
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
57 boards the
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
boards the boards have to regulate their
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
Industries right you don't want the
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislature regulating your industry and
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
taking over the a Board responsibility
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
because we're we're not you're not going
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
to like what happens the the other piece
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'll just add is um I I do my director
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
of Licensing Bethany catell is is
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
regularly engaged on the social work
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
compact because they're they're working
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
on that language now she's going to
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
meetings regularly and what I can do is
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
have her reach out to the other states
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
that are engaged in that conversation
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
and see what the criteria and what other
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
states are doing if we're looking at
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
kind of that National piece because it
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
sounds like if New Hampshire's having
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
that problem fitting the job with the
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
exam are the is are other states having
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
the exact same questions that we're
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
having y yep and and I would be shocked
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
if they're not
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like we have a pathway to
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
fix this
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
yep just so just for the
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
timing might it be possible that we'll
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
get an amendment from you or a
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion for Amendment from you in the
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
next week or so or a couple of
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
weeks I think you're looking at a
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of board work and
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
discussion I in that I'm just asking
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
because then then if we don't do that
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
then I think we make we want to retain
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
the bill because we certainly don't want
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
to kill it and then we would work on it
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
we would give them the opportunity to
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
come back next year that's what I'm yeah
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
I mean we'll talk with the chair uh as
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
to whether just if retention is is the
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do this or if it's
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
just a matter of refiling right in the
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
in the fall with something else I'll
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
I'll talk with her about it but um but
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's how we see this so
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
so so House Bill 271 is not not the way
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
to get that done but but I think we I
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
think we can get to where we need to be
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just going to take a
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of finagling so yeah I think
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
the only VAR variable would be when if I
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
say here's the rules of the criteria
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they've established and you got you
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
as the subcommittee and the committee
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable that that's enough to
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
strike it then you wouldn't need an
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
amendment you could rely on those
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
criteria so I I think there is a
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
possibility that you could take that to
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
a full committee and I can provide that
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
to I I could provide that to you in the
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
next 15 minutes so you can gauge your
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
comfort level there sure and and I think
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
as a committee right when we get into
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
executive session we can discuss what
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
what this board is allowed to do yeah
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
right right now and then if and if
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's enough to to get us down that
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
road then the board's got some work
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
ahead of it right well the the board
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
right now per the statute can only can
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
approve a national exam
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
if a national exam does if a lower
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
National exam does not exist the board
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
the board is just approving its option
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
in in front of it if that makes sense so
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
meet other criterias established by the
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
board is not
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
enough well so the the one that the the
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
bill is my understanding is proposing to
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
strike the you know to successfully
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
complete the exam that's approved by the
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
board so the board has the authority to
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
approve a national appro to approve a
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
national exam so they could pick from
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
the array but they probably have picked
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
the one that's available to them and the
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
the policy decision is is that
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate the board wouldn't be able
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
to invent a new National
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
exam sure yeah so th this is where this
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
is where we get grumpy with OSS right
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
because you you provided OS if you're
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
watching you provided us a bill that
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
strikes out two pieces of legislation
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
right it would have probably been nice
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
it probably would have been smart to put
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
what that is yeah right because it's
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not here so the whole
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph would have probably been a
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
better choice with strikethroughs rather
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
than just just that so um but cool all
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
right so I think we're I think we've got
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
it we've got some things figured out
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
here and and uh and we'll go from there
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
so when when this does come to the exact
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
session d i we're going to need your
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
Clarity on on we will be there on their
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
Authority awesome thank you
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else have
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
anything they want to add to this okay
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful what's our
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation our
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation right now is I think that
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is we're going to
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
have an INF full executive committee
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
discuss what we just discussed here with
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
with the input from oplc as to whether
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
or what Authority that board
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
has to make changes because if if they
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
if they don't
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
and they're stuck by either compact
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirements or or their only
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
requirement is that they can pick an
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
exam then we're kind of handcuffed
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
either we're we're removing the exam or
 
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.470 align:start position:0%
either we're we're removing the exam or
we're

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
okay and we'll go from there right I
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
mean that's the legislation in it of
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
itself only stri is attempting to strike
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
out something so either we agree to
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
strike it out or we don't but we're kind
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
of doing them a solid here in the sense
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
that if we have the ability to amend
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
this and the committee's agreeable to
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
that then it's a discussion to have at
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
the with the entire executive board or
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
not the executive board the entire uh
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
board and or committee and executive
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
session okay well my understanding of a
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is the one is that we do
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
the work and then we make the
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the board so I'd like
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
to see what the amendment would be like
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
so that we could prepare the amendment
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and bring it to the subcommittee to the
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
executive session are you saying that
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that if we're going to
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
do that then we'll we would have to
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
probably do this one more time unless we
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
can we'll go into recess and then NFD
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
can come up with that while we're
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
sitting here I think representative
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
scitec has a
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative they're on the other the
 
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.230 align:start position:0%
representative they're on the other the
other

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
one sure can you come up here so that
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to like scream and we
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't we can listen I know but come on
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
up our friend our representative friend
 
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.630 align:start position:0%
up our friend our representative friend
from

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
Salem I'm not a big fan of compacts
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
they're necessary evils so at the
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
considerable risk of uh agreeing with
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
the chair the thing that occurred to me
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
is if this is only the narrow issue of
 
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.950 align:start position:0%
is if this is only the narrow issue of
the

00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
exam I'm not a fan of exams that shows
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
you that you've done a good job with the
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
exam more than any profession I can
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
think of there should be an oral
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
component I don't know if there is one
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
where a skilled Board of
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
examiners asks puts people asks
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions and puts them as as much as an
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
oral can do into a real life situation
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
with the sufficient skill to irritate
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
the qu person being questioned to see
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
how they react this is in you're dealing
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
with this is People to People contact
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
you want you want warm
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
fuzzy heart and a hard
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
brain you want somebody that's engaging
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's warm that encourages trust but
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
the the person's watching the audience
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
is watching the person that they're in
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
ch in charge of so that can steer a
 
00:44:58.559 --> 00:44:59.950 align:start position:0%
ch in charge of so that can steer a
Direction

00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
Direction
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
so my pitch is so the as you know
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
represent scitech the criteria is is
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
more than just the exam there'ss
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's a component I'm going to
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
throw into the mix that I think there
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
should be an AAL component retention is
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
a great idea but before you do any
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
amendments I'm not clear that you guys
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a real policy agreement or sense
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
yet no we're no we're it's going to
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
we're still chugging along and and
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
hoping to get some clarity from oplc on
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can even do that
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely so what I'm going to do is
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put 271 in recess we'll get
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
into 145 that way we're not we don't
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
just wait because there's other folks
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
here to to um get into house bill 145
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
so let me open the hearing on house the
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing on House Bill
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
145 house bill for the reminder
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the millions around the world that
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
watch us on uh
 
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.950 align:start position:0%
watch us on uh
YouTube

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
145 is relative to the background checks
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
of the licensed
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
dieticians and adopting a dietician lure
 
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.950 align:start position:0%
dieticians and adopting a dietician lure
compact

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
um we we had several folks coming in on
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
both sides of this
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
um and there was the phrase privilege to
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
practice model that was stated several
 
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.030 align:start position:0%
practice model that was stated several
times

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
is again all these compacts are
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
different I wish you know you kind of
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
wish there was like a c a cookie cutter
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
way of doing these so you could just sit
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
there and go okay compact this compact
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
that but since they're all different um
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
my notes is I'm refreshing myself 10
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
states have filed four states have
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
agreed which is not we're not there yet
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
on a compact but that's how all compact
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
start um
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
reciprocity we do have reciprocity
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
now but you would have to meet the
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
second State's requirement which is how
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
in the old days of reciprocity that's
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
um that's that's where we are here and
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
there was some concern because this is
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
the compact right that we've got the 20
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
plus Pages or um you know the right out
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
of the gate the use of the word office
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
some some issue with that and then of
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
course the big discussion really seemed
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
to center around paragraph three which
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
involved FBI's background
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
checks and the FBI reluctance or concern
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
about releasing their findings
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
nonspecific person on the receiving end
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
now I think that that can be handled
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
fairly easily the HR Director the
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's I think we can name somebody
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
right I don't I don't but there seemed
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
to be some hang up with when it came to
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
time um involving that and then we did
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
have some discussion of the necessity of
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
background checks even existing here so
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
I am going to open this up
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
to anyone who wants to render an opinion
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
on what
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
happened and if how they saw things
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative groa thank you so
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
typically compact discussion are quite
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
dull but I have to tell you that at this
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
particular hearing we had many
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
dieticians come and testify in favor of
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
the compact this is something that they
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
want they they ask me to it is my bill
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
so do I have to I get to speak right
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
I and I out of um support out of the
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
dietician um profession entered the bill
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
I also told them that this was their
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
lift they needed to do it and they have
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
done it I think that there is confusion
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
in the industry as to what a dietician
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
is as opposed to somebody that you talk
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
to if you want to go on a diet that is
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
not the same
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing right they are not Nutri they are
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
not nutritionists these people people
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
work in hospitals they work in medical
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
areas they are not people that you talk
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
to if you want to go on a low carb diet
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
or gluten-free diet or anything like
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
that so I and they are here to testify
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
and to talk with us so I would invite
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
them Mr chair at your
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
discretion yeah absolutely I you know
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not like I said I'm always very
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
hesitant with compacts but I'm not
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
anti-c compact I think compacts serve a
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
purpose purp and and um if they're
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw all right thank you
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative tiek um you know I did
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
ask that question during the hearing
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
where in this compact does New Hampshire
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
have the right to exit that is found on
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
page 20 we it is there so so that's
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
really you know my my general concern
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
some compacts when you get into them
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
incentives for being early if you will
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you you see that some compacts have
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
it where you know if you're the first
 
00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
eight states you're you get to sit at
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
the big boy table sort of and and direct
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
um you know compact creation policies
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
and things like that we didn't really
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
have any discussion of that as far as
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
this goes and and you're more than
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
welcome to come up if you're familiar
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
with this if if that if there's I didn't
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
see that in here it may not exist in
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
this compact but
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
um button yep and just remind me who you
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
are okay I am Kate fifel I am a
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
dietician I do work at conquered
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
hospital but I'm not here representing
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
the hospital I'm here representing the
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter of the Academy of
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
nutrition and dietetics um yes there is
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
an incentive to be one of the first
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
seven states to pass the compact lure it
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
gets you a seat at the commission to
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
form the commission and be part of the
 
00:51:52.789 --> 00:51:52.799 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process so that would be um
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
something that we are definitely sure
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
highly interested in since we were here
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
for the public hearing um just to note
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
in New England both Maine and Rhode
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
Island have made it into session which
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
are neighbors um there are currently 14
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
States in session now since that hearing
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
total and there are four that have
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
passed and I've heard through the gra
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
fine one more is about to be signed um
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
and another just passed a subcommittee
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
so they're moving rapidly we' like to be
 
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
one of the first seven to get a seat at
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
that table um and I'm sorry if that
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't relayed
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
previously yeah I think we we got we got
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
kind of focused on on a couple of of
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
issues that seem
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
to Garner discussion at the when we were
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing um of course the
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
question that is always asked and it's
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's a we're at the point now where we
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
should open with what this does to
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
military folks that that every single
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
compact we enter into that question is
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
asked um that is addressed in section
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
six that's correct rate that's gets that
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
whole problem out of the way so I mean
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
the whoever drafted the the initial
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
compact proposal here um I can tell by
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
looking at it that they were not a
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
novice at this whoever did it right
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
because the things that we've seen that
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
were problematic in other compacts that
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
are addressed in
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
here the only one like I said that we
 
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.309 align:start position:0%
here the only one like I said that we
really

00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
got stuck on was when it came to the
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you when it came to the
 
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
um the criminal history part I I am not
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
a fan of dumping that I I think the
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
background checks have a a very
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
important place here we've had some
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
we've had some problems in New Hampshire
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
yes with not related to this field in
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form but in other
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
fields of people border hopping in their
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
jobs and escaping their path
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
by jumping around New England in a
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
circle yes right no we're not making
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
that mistake again so
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
the the that is addressed with this
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
compact it is and yes and the the
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
criminal history part of this also helps
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the sense that you're you're bringing
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
forward you're not hiding convictions or
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
problems that that
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
happened but again you know when the
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
officer um stated that they routinely
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
see issues with the FBI coming back and
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
bringing things because of a nondescript
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
they don't want to just randomly give
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
these out so it sounds like that's very
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
fixable we would need to
 
00:54:40.359 --> 00:54:42.710 align:start position:0%
fixable we would need to
amend

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
amend
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
this if we're able to and the reason I
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
say if is because sometimes with these
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
compacts if they're if they are what's
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
being drawn up universally amongst the
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
states it is a go or no go agreement
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
right it I'm I'm I've been counseled
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
through our Nationals they are working
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
on this it can be amended and they
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
actually are having conversations along
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
with other entities such as the Council
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
of state government they're working with
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
Congress they're trying to get some of
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
these issues resolved on a national
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
level not just related to dieticians in
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
our compact so it sounds to me and if I
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
remember correctly if we can address the
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
the paragraph three really um and not
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
use the term the office and we get a
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
specific release of this and we'll work
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
with the oplc director to get who that
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the title is of the person
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether a human resources or compliance
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
officer security officer whatever
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
whatever the term is but if we can
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
narrow that down to something specific I
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
think that solves the problems that
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're addressed in the public hearing
 
00:55:51.839 --> 00:55:53.630 align:start position:0%
we're addressed in the public hearing
with

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
delaying this process because if the FBI
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
takes forever with this and they're not
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
even comfortable releasing it all this
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
stops because you got to paragraph 3 and
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
it's over so
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
um that that's what I see representative
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
groda did you guys see any other
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
concerns other than that part of that
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you think needs to be tweaked no I
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't think so and if if a if um
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
director jurus has a solution to that
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
looks like she
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
might yeah I was actually I was going to
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
make a note to say so it it appears to
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
me that
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
the the first section about the criminal
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
history record
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
checks is unrelated to the compact so
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
what I what I was suggesting if the
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
committee might be amendable the
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is we we're going to have
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
to look at some language per the
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
department of safety for a number of the
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
the language there's quite a bit of
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
language in the other bills that you had
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
heard so what I what I was thinking was
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps that section of about background
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
checks could actually be part of an
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
amendment with the language we're
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
working on for all of those other pieces
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
on another bill the committee is
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
currently considering that we're doing
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
cleanup language in and then you could
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
keep the the compact clean and just
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
leave it
 
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
separate a humble suggestion okay on
 
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
process let me just for clarity just so
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding what you're saying
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
um what what I'm hearing you're saying
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
is that you want a un
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
uniform the background check
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
language amongst many of
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
these because we have problems not just
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
this one yes okay that's I like that and
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's another bill before the
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee that you'd had you've had a
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it's currently in
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee that has because we use the
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
identical language everywhere in statute
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
for these and we're still not confident
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the FBI is going to approve but
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
based on the best guidance we have we
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
have language that we're preparing for
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
those other sections in the other bills
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
so what I if the committee was open to
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
it we could amend this one to repeal
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
that section in this bill leave the
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
compact all alone and then tie that
 
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
piece in as part of a further Amendment
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
where I'm making those other adjustments
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
in the cleanup language so then then you
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
could skip all the controversy and then
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
own yep can you is that the is is that
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Maguire in my bill
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
could you know what that that bill
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
number is I think that's it's either 82
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
or 85 yes one of the two and I think
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
that one is come is is both of those
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
okay they're both here so what we could
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
do is if we have an amendment for when
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
when we have that subcommittee hearing
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you might bring that
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then we could okay yeah we
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
can shoot we can solve all that solve
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
all of those problems in one shot so we
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
could just continue this bill to that
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing we could
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey you just trying to
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
remember it seems to me we've
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
Consolidated a lot of things over the
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
last few years and some of them said
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
office and some of them said director
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
and some of them said this one and that
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
one and that that we were trying to I
 
00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
think the one they settled on was to say
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
director and then that assumes everybody
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
under the director too as the Director
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
is responsible the problem that it
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
appears is that that is too broad for
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
what the FBI is looking for um but what
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
I what I do think part of the reason
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
oplc was created was for uniformity and
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
consistency across things so if if we
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
can come up or they can come up with an
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
acceptable way of of writing this part
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
of it and apply it across the board I
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
think that's helpful that's helpful for
 
00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
everybody and then and then also on top
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
of that right you go to the FBI with
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
whoever the guinea pig is whichever one
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
ends up going first if you get the green
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
light on that I would like to think that
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
that would speed things up for everybody
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
else because they've already approved
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
that language it's uniform across the
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
board yeah it it's very much a moving T
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
Target uh right now and representative
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
Bailey I was just to your point is very
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
well taken I think it is interesting to
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
say when you say the office of the
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
executive director you're right it it
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
means anybody who's doing the work so
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
the FBI taking issue with the word
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
office when in reality it's the same
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
function I I don't know the statutory
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
construction I think is pretty clear but
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh we're going with the best guidance we
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
have right now so representative long
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
sure so what specifically is the I
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
challenge with getting firmer guidance
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
from the FBI about what they want uh and
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
is there reluctance is it based in a
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
statute a regulation is there some
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
underlying document that you could look
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
at to determine what exactly they need
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
we are asking the same question that you
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
are of the Department of Safety we want
 
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:10.039 align:start position:0%
to work collaboratively we were not
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
aware until the public hearing that that
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
was an issue so we we've been in
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
conversation with them I think the
 
01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
reason we're not getting Clarity is
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
because when we ask for clarity they
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
point us to the rule or um the RSA and
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
it clearly states that it can be a
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
government entity
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
but then when we put a government entity
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
in the statute they say it's too broad
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
so that is the Crux of the challenge so
 
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
we we're trying to do based on safety's
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the review to say what what
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
they think is close or is going to pass
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's the best we can
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
do but we have the same questions I can
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
tell you attorney fry is extremely
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
frustrated So when you say oplc that's
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
too broad but if you said director of
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
oplc would that ding that's the one or
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
that's the guidance that we've been
 
01:02:02.269 --> 01:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
given don't you love
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy it's is classic example yes
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
now now within within your office do you
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
have someone that falls under the title
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
of either HR Director compliance officer
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
someone someone that has something
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
specific that seems to fall in line as
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
to what they're looking for does that
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
oplc there are positions that are title
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
similar to that but those are not the
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
credentialing you know these are I don't
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
have my HR Director reviewing cbc's for
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
every licy that's what licensing clerks
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
do it seems as
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
though what there what they need is they
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
need someone to they're looking for some
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
specific title to deliver these
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
background checks too once you receive
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
those what you do internally with those
 
01:02:55.319 --> 01:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
those what you do internally with those
is

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
you once the FBI releases them to the
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
oplc whoever that is you do what you do
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't there's no there's no
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
chain of custody type stuff here with
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
this so don't don't quote me on this I'm
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
not I'm not an attorney or really an
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
expert in this FBI thing there there is
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a Prohibition on secondary
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
dissemination I mean there's a lot these
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
this is really tightly regulated um and
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot there there's a lot
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
of mixed signals would say but uh if the
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
committee would like we can we can
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
continue this discussion when we're
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with the other language and the
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
other Bill and um I know you guys have
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
had a long day so I think safy would be
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
better to answer these questions than
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
than me quite frankly I I'm just telling
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
you what they've told me I mean safety
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
was that was they don't like this that's
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
what they said okay well what do they
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
like and that's where things kind of
 
01:03:58.349 --> 01:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
fell short y so we have some language to
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
propose to um to you that we think meets
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
what they've asked for and I can include
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
this section with the other ones that
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
we've been working on okay
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey so some people are
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
already in this compact right and so
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
what are they doing no the compact has
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
not taken effect yet because they have
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
not met the minimum threshold for States
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
agreeing that this they're creating the
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
pie right now they just haven't made the
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
slices this is completely separate from
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
the compact this is just additional
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
language that if you read the bill it
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
says information it says background
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
checks and the compact so the compact is
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
a separate Clause it has nothing to do
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the compact okay thank you
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah in the legislation the compact
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
begins uh paragraph four right this is
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
over and above but I was just thinking
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
hello guys what are you doing as as it
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
is as it is as this legislation is
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
written we do have to address it one way
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
or the other to right I I I don't think
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
it's a hang up on passing the compact
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
it's just right let's let's just get in
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
it get it straightened out and and we'll
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
have that consistency yep so in the
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
spirit of something that we did last
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
session in oplc in in Edna with when we
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
wrote House Bill 655 was to take out the
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
administrative functions of the boards
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
and put them under the direction of the
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
office and this and as a result of that
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of cleanup that had to
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
happen and we've been slowly getting
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
through that and this background check
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
information falls in the office
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
baileywick so we should definitely take
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
it out of this bill and put it in the
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
other and add it so that all of the
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
background checks will be handled the
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
same way so if you have that
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
language if you could bring it to the
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
next subcommittee meeting we could um
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
have an amendment for that and we would
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
we would amend this bill by taking that
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
out takeing taking the background check
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
part out okay taking the background
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
check part out may be problematic for
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
some no it's just going to go in a
 
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.789 align:start position:0%
some no it's just going to go in a
different

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
Bell no hold on a second the the D the
 
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
modification of that you're you're
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
talking about putting into a separate
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill if you remove the criminal
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
background checks out of this then
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
you've removed the requirement of
 
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
background checks for this and that's
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
not that's no no no no no we're not
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
doing that oh I see what you're saying
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
we're just going to copy and paste we're
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
just going to C we just amend this cut
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
cut and paste cut out of
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
hb45 and paste in HB 82 yeah that's
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
we're just going to cut and paste all in
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
the committee you're not eliminating the
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
background check you're just modifying
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
the language so that it is consistent
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
across you use like a computer sense is
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
where you use a go-to like you have a
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
piece of Statute says this is the
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
background check and then all these
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
other things point to that RSA piece or
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
and in a perfect world that's exactly
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
how you would do it because then if you
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
have to make changes to it you make
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
changes to one part of Statute and then
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's all referenced so how do we do that
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
we had too much Frankenstein going on
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
for that I got 60 different practice
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
acts but I hear you I would love that
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
someday that's that would be a dream
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
that can that's one of those bills that
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
comes in on a second year that's this
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
thick which we which we've done before
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
right correct but you would that but
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
again you're 57 boards that's 57 Boards
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
that sure yep so I agree with the
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
director that that's that is a fight
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's coming it's not today they're not
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
ready for that yet
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
so so that would I so I guess then the
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this subcommittee then
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph section one paragraphs 1 2 and
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I don't like the way
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
they wrote this just the way they
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
chopped out the paragraphs because the
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
section one should just be
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
the the criminal background part of it
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
and then it then the compact should
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
begin at section two and they just
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
didn't write it that way would yeah they
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
just they just didn't write it that way
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
would the subcommittee like attorney fry
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
to take a stab at the two different
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
amendments and hand them both at the
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
same time so you look at them next to
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
each other i' I'd be happy to ask him to
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
do that sure that'd be great yep yep you
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
feel confident I know what you want okay
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well again it's not necessarily
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
what we want we want this to work we
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
want this to not be an incumbrance upon
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
the process right if because if you if
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to require background
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
checks the process has to function so um
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
but I do agree I do agree with
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey very much in the
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
sense that if if we're going to have the
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to have the language
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
the language has to be the same across
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
the board and the ability to change it
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
if if there are problems that come up
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
later needs to be not a 275 page bill it
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be one bill that says this is
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
how we're going to dress background
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
checks and everybody else just refer
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's all referral so this
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
congratulations to your dietician
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
compact you are plowing the field first
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
on this and um if we'll we'll go from
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
there so okay thank you chair and
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee sponsor G thank you very much
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
so there we go so perfect all right so
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
our so as a committee then our
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation on 145 is
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
to amend the background check part
 
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.669 align:start position:0%
to amend the background check part
for

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
um or this one it is 80 it is 82 82 okay
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay marvelous so that I mean we don't
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily we can go get all formal and
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
make motions on that um but that's I
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
just think we should make a motion to
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
continue with this to the next meeting
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
because we still have a subcommittee
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
meeting on the other bill
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
in fact we might have a subcommittee
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
meeting on 82 and 85 next that that is
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
where going that would definitely clean
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
everything up the only thing is though
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
just so you know when I do that because
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have to talk
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
about this when we when we schedule that
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
I have to include this on the list just
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
so just so you know it's gonna we can't
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can't start discussing H Bill 145 in
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee hearing on House Bill 82
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
right that's just not appropriate we
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
have to provide notices that so and
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine but just just for your
 
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
scheduling and and um you know paying
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
attention to things Point that's that's
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
why that will pop up do you have
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
something first director I uh I was just
 
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
I got a um Return to Sender email I sent
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
an email to the four of you with the
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
rules for the social work but
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative long your email came back
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
that it was unable to send to you but
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's your general court email so that's
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%

to send it to you but I'm not I'm not
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
sure if that's a clerk or an IT thing
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
but they changed my email because the it
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
system was confused by there being two
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
Patrick Longs in the system okay so it
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
is now Patrick n. long and not patrick.
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
n. long it's Pat yeah oh I see okay so
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's only one period yeah
 
01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.590 align:start position:0%
there's there's only one period yeah
okay

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
I um so they um you may want to the link
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
when I click on your representative
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
profile has still has the the second dot
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
so it it is coming back returned to
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%

for bringing that up in public but I
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%

adjourn and I will I will second that in
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
the in the sense that we have um we seem
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
to have a path forward on both of these
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
as to what we're thinking and uh and
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
we'll uh and we'll go from there we'll
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
add We'll add 145 to the 8285
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
um meeting that will probably happen
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen in the next two
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
weeks so I just have to go through and
