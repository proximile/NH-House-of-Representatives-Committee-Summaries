00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah all right um it's good to see
 
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
yeah all right um it's good to see
everybody

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
i had a few quick slides that i thought
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
i could go over and share
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
um just showing where we're at with
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
claim volume and what the trust fund is
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
currently doing
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
and then i can talk briefly about
 
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.350 align:start position:0%
and then i can talk briefly about
overpayments

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
overpayments
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
and appeals and then do my best to
 
00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
and appeals and then do my best to
answer

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
all of the questions uh from any of the
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
members so
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
i'll quickly uh share my screen with a
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
couple of slides
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
there we go is it mr commissioner we've
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
allotted an hour and a half we don't
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
have to use the entire hour and a half
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
but i don't want you to feel you're
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
rushed either so
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
all right this shouldn't take too long
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is from or similar to a
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
presentation that
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh brian gottlob and i had done earlier
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
this week for
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
senate uh ways and means um this is just
 
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
senate uh ways and means um this is just
the

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
portion of the presentation that looks
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
at claim volume
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
and trust fund so this first slide that
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
folks are seeing is uh shows you monthly
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
initial claim numbers just giving some
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
perspective on
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
what we have experienced during
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and comparing that back to
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
the great recession and i say comparing
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
that back to the great recession you
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
really can't
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
compare them neither with the speed with
 
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
compare them neither with the speed with
which

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh the claims increased during the
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic and
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
the heights that they reached during the
 
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
the heights that they reached during the
pandemic

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're really uh the they're really um
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges um when you look at
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
them um and
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
and what we've been tasked uh with doing
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh you see on that right hand side of
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
your screen with that
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
dramatic spike in those monthly numbers
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
back during the great recession when we
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
look at the weekly claims
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
um so on this slide these are the weekly
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
claim filers so people that
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
file a weekly claim in order to trigger
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
a payment of unemployment benefits
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
you see on the left-hand side of your
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
screen where we were
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
the week prior to the
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
emergency order from governor sununu
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
expanding eligibility
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
in a few weeks prior to the federal
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
government expanding eligibility with
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
the cares act so march 14th 2020 we were
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
just under 4 000 weekly claims
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was where we had been for quite
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
some time uh with
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh with you know having experienced um
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
the longest period of recovery um
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
in our history uh with the growth from
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
the great recession
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and then quickly um things uh took a
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
different turn
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
um we saw our claim volume spiking
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
through march and april and then we
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
peaked um with the week ending may 2nd
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
you see where we were just under 100
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
000 weekly filers so that is the single
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
largest week ever in the history of new
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire's unemployment program
 
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
um those numbers um uh then fell
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
through last summer and um
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
the fall then started to go up again
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
with a spike and covet cases uh with
 
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
with a spike and covet cases uh with
late

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
fall and into the winter and then we
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
started 2021
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
um with just over 45 000
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
weekly filers um so a far cry
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
from where we were at the height of the
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic but
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
as you can see um you know
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
about 10 times where we were prior to
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
um looking uh to as current as we can
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
get with our numbers
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we have from the bureau of labor
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
statistics we are at 36 thousand
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
four twenty nine uh with the week of
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
april 17th
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
um something important to be said here
 
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.389 align:start position:0%
um something important to be said here
um

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh is the inside the numbers um and all
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
of the different
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
programs that are part of each of these
 
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.430 align:start position:0%
programs that are part of each of these
so

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
obviously with the um the pre-pandemic
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
number of 3909 that was all state ui
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
right because that was our only program
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
that we had available to individuals
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
for accessing unemployment benefits then
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
as we get into the pandemic numbers
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
these are a blend
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
of programs so it's both state ui for
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
those people
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
that qualify for regular state
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits meaning they had
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient earnings in their four
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
quarter base period and they had a
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation that was
 
00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:16.550 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation that was
determined

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
not to be the fault of the individual so
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
the most common situation there is
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
some type of layoff but also we have the
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
federal cares act programs for
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
you have the pandemic unemployment
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
that's the program that's created
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
benefits for self-employed
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
for gig workers and for individuals that
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
need to remove themselves
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
from the labor force due to a pandemic
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
reason for which eligibility was created
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
under the cares act
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
so those are folks that could be dealing
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
with covet themselves could be caring
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
for someone in the household
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
that has coveted prior to schools
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
being required to be back offering
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
in-person learning that could have been
 
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
in-person learning that could have been
apparent

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
with a remote learner and they are
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
unable to work as a result of the school
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
being closed could be someone that is
 
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.389 align:start position:0%
being closed could be someone that is
self-quarantined

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
self-quarantined
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the advice of their health care
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
provider so that would be someone with
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
an underlying medical condition that
 
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
an underlying medical condition that
their

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
their medical professional has said um
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
should not
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
be going into a work environment um and
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
um the self-employed and gig workers
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
like i had mentioned
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the federal extension as
 
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the federal extension as
well

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
so people that have exhausted their
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
state ui
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
they transition into the pandemic
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
emergency unemployment compensation
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
program or peuc
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
and so when we look at a week of april
 
00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
and so when we look at a week of april
17th

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
17th
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
2021 that 36 425
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
429 includes all of those programs
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
um that breakdown is about uh
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
19 000 people out of that 36 000
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
are in state ui and the balance
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
of them are in either pua which is right
 
00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
of them are in either pua which is right
around

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
9 000 so those are the people that are
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
either self were self-employed
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
a gig worker or remove themselves from
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
the labor force
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and then the balance of that is
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
people who have exhausted state ui
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
and are in the federal extension now um
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
as we'll see in the next slide with the
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown of dollars
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
everyone or two slides later so
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
um not to get ahead of myself but
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
everyone that's in
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
any of those programs also gets the
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
extra 300 a week
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
in that federal enhancement as well and
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'll show you a breakdown of those
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in a minute
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
this slide gives you a comparison
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
of how new hampshire stacks up against
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
i mean we've called out our new england
 
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.350 align:start position:0%
i mean we've called out our new england
neighbors

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
so you can see where everyone currently
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
sits um but what we try to do here
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
is give people a real good
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
sense of the current state
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
of the number of people filing
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
for unemployment in either state or
 
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.150 align:start position:0%
for unemployment in either state or
federal

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
programs as a percentage of our
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic labor force
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of unexplained
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in labor force numbers as
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
published by bls during the pandemic
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
they have admitted that their numbers
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
are less than reliable
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
so what we have been doing is we've been
 
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.230 align:start position:0%
so what we have been doing is we've been
comparing

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
comparing
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
our numbers against our pre-pandemic
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
labor force number
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
in order to remove uh some of that
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
unexplainable fluctuation
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
from bls and as you can see here new
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire in the red
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
we have the lowest percentage of people
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment benefits
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
in any of the programs either state or
 
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.310 align:start position:0%
in any of the programs either state or
federal

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a lowest in the northeast as a
 
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
as a lowest in the northeast as a
percentage

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
of our pre-pandemic labor force just
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
under five percent
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
maine you can see is the closest to us
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
here in new england
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is the furthest away from
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
us here in new england
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
um at just over 15 percent
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh kind of grouped in uh uh other states
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
that are having a
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
much more difficult time on getting
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go back to that prior
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
slide but i wanted to talk about this
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
as it makes more sense to talk about
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
this first this is the dollar breakdown
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the money that has been paid out of
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
the unemployment system during the
 
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.069 align:start position:0%
the unemployment system during the
pandemic

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
so we've paid out just over 1.82
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in benefits that's more
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
than we paid out in the prior decade
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
this chart gives you a sense of where
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
those dollars have been sourced from
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
so that top line of f-puc that's the
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
federal enhancement program so that was
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
the six hundred dollar enhancement
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 that lasted until july
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
and is currently set at three hundred
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
dollars a week
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
that gets added to everyone that
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
qualifies for a weekly benefit amount in
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
either ui
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
pua or peuc they get that 300
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
that goes until september 4th under the
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've paid out just over a billion
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in just that enhancement
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
the red bar you see is from our state
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund we have paid out just over
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
324 million dollars in benefits
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
uh we started and i have a slide that
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
will show you where we currently are
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
but just to not build up suspense we are
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
currently at
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
104 million in our trust fund we started
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
at 300 million uh pua we've paid out
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
just over 321 million dollars in pua
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
um importantly all of the the blue lines
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
here are all federally sourced
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the only state trust fund source of
 
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
and the only state trust fund source of
payments

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
is that red line i'm in ui payments um
 
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.070 align:start position:0%
is that red line i'm in ui payments um
lwa

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
lwa
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
we paid out 88 million dollars that was
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
the lost wages assistance program that
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
added 300
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
a week to people's benefits for six
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
weeks back in
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
august and september of 2020 that was
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
done by presidential
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
memorandum at the time and then lastly
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
the peuc so that's the federal extension
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 58.5 million dollars
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
that has been paid out of that which is
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh federal as well
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
now going back to the slide that i
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
skipped over
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
um with regard to trust fund solvency
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
right now we have 22 states that have
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
depleted their trust funds
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
there they have borrowed a total of 55
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
or just over 55 billion
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
dollars including 2.2 billion borrowed
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
by massachusetts
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is borrowing done in order for them
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
to pay weekly benefits
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
um our trust fund remains solvent like i
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
said we are
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently at 104 million dollars
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we are forecasted to stay
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
solvent through 2021 in large measure
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
due to the 50 million dollars that was
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
provided to the trust fund from federal
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
cares act money
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the decision made earlier by governor
 
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
in the decision made earlier by governor
sununu

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
so the impact on employer tax rates that
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
employers have experienced so far during
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
the first impact that caused their rates
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
to go up was the loss of the fund
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
balance reductions
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
so that that's our statutory solvency
 
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.990 align:start position:0%
so that that's our statutory solvency
control

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
on the trust fund where when the fund
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
reaches 250 million
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
employers get a reduction in their rate
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
of a half
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
point and then at 275 million they get a
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
full point reduction
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
and at 300 million they get a point and
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
a half reduction
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
as the claim
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
roles increased as quickly and as
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
significantly as they did
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
and and the balance in the trust fund
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
fell as quickly as it did those
 
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:22.230 align:start position:0%
fell as quickly as it did those
reductions

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh were quickly removed because the fund
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
was below that 250 million dollar mark
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and as a result in the third and
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
fourth quarters of 2020 we had a half
 
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
fourth quarters of 2020 we had a half
point

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
statutory surcharge on employer tax
 
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.270 align:start position:0%
statutory surcharge on employer tax
rates

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
we were able to remove that effective
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
with the first
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2021 we don't
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
expect there to be any surcharges for
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
the remaining quarters of 2021
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
and importantly we never
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
implemented the second half point
 
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
implemented the second half point
surcharge

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
surcharge
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
in statute uh so although employer tax
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.230 align:start position:0%
in statute uh so although employer tax
rates

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
have gone up as a as a result of the
 
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
have gone up as a as a result of the
loss

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
loss
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the fund balance reductions um they
 
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:10.549 align:start position:0%
of the fund balance reductions um they
are

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently um at at uh what i refer to as
 
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.710 align:start position:0%
currently um at at uh what i refer to as
neutral

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and they're paying at the rate that's
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
the result of their experience
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
they are not having an increased rate
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
because of the surcharges
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
those are not in play right now
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
and again uh the the intent of
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh the money from the karzak flex fund
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid those surcharges
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
was so that we weren't creating a
 
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.909 align:start position:0%
was so that we weren't creating a
disincentive

00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
disincentive
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
for employers to hire by creating by
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
making it more expensive
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
for them to bring on each additional
 
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
for them to bring on each additional
employee

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
so employers are at their true
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
experience rate
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
right now however their experience rate
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
is lower
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
right now than it would have been
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
had there not been additional measures
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
taken as a part of the original
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
emergency order that the governor issued
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
back in march of 2020
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
um so all of the benefits that we've
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
paid out that you
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
saw the breakdown by program normally
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
those that are paid out of the state ui
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
those would be charged against tax
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
paying employers
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
so when i refer to their experience
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
their experience is
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
both as a positive and negative
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
um pieces to that the positive being we
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
look at what they've paid in in taxes
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
the negative to the employer is that we
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
apply the benefits paid out to their
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
former employees
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
against their experience that has not
 
00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:40.149 align:start position:0%
against their experience that has not
been

00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
going on during the pandemic so during
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
all benefit charges have been direct
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
charged to the fund
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
rather than to the experience rate of
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
the tax paying employers
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
the result of that is going to be that
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
as employers see their
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
tax rate determinations that get issued
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
those go out every august
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then control your rate for
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
quarters three four one and two um
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
those those determinations will not
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
have an increase in their experience
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
rate based on the benefits that have
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
been paid out
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
that that's important for keeping their
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
rates down
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
and again that's been in place since uh
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
march of 2020. likewise we have not been
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
requiring non-profits to reimburse the
 
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.270 align:start position:0%
requiring non-profits to reimburse the
fund

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar for benefits paid out
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
like they normally would
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
so reimbursing employers like our
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other nonprofits who
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
normally would have to reimburse the
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
fund dollar for dollar that has not been
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
taking place
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
as well so that 50 million from the
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
cares act covered
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh that as well so that no one is
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
getting a free ride
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
on the trust fund which was created by
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
the quarterly tax payments from
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
taxpaying employers but all those are
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
are measures that have had impact on
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
employer rates
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
um and um i think um in large measure
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
what we have seen as rates have stayed
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
much lower than they could have
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
otherwise been
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
certainly and lower than was the
 
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.549 align:start position:0%
certainly and lower than was the
experience

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
from employers following the great
 
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:29.830 align:start position:0%
from employers following the great
recession

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
recession
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
when they were hit with both surcharges
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
when their experience was hit so their
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
experience rating was going up causing
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
an increase in their rates
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
so none of that has happened we continue
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
to stay solvent
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
and continue to forecast that we'll be
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
able to avoid
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and i think this is the last slide
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into overpayments
 
00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
and then we can get into overpayments
and

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh appeals related questions
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh this is our updated forecast um this
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
is from we have uh
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
both uh brian gottlob our director of
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
our economic and labor market
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
information bureau
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
and one of his economists they do
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
dueling forecasts
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so that we can they do different
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
methods in their forecasting and that
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
helps us with uh
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
to control and see how each of them are
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
doing how close they are
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
um our our band for where we expect to
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
be finishing 2021
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh right now is a balance between 65 to
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
84 million
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund and then improvements
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
although not shown here
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
but improvements going into 2022.
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
um so um the the fund stays
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
um relatively healthy compared to
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on um what we
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
experienced during the pandemic and uh
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
the experience of other states and what
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
they have seen
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
so uh fortunate in that regard that
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
we're able to start
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
um with such a healthy trust fund
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll stop sharing right there and
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'll talk a little bit about
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh overpayments and appeals
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
as well um but first i'll i'll address
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
appeals as that's a little bit
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
um uh not quite as complicated as
 
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.390 align:start position:0%
um uh not quite as complicated as
overpayments

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
overpayments
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
um but appeals are a um
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it's an area that is difficult
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to bring on
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
the expertise that you need in a quick
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
fashion i
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
um compare it to
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
a court that's um that receives a
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
decade's worth of
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
cases in a short period of time can't
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
just go out and grab a bunch of judges
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
off the street to come in and hear those
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
um so it requires a certain
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
amount of knowledge and a skill level
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
that you can conduct that type of
 
00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:56.549 align:start position:0%
that you can conduct that type of
hearing

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
so what we've what we've done we have
 
00:26:59.520 --> 00:26:59.990 align:start position:0%
so what we've what we've done we have
brought

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
in we went from 10 hearing off our from
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
four hearing officers rather
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
to 10 hearing officers currently they
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
are all on the docket
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
they are hearing cases we have
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
issued a request for proposals out to
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law firms in order to
 
00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law firms in order to
supplement

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
our hearing officers for new hampshire
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
licensed attorneys
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to conduct hearings and issue
 
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
to be able to conduct hearings and issue
decisions

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
we felt that was a better alternative
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
bringing in or trying to bring in and
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
skill up
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
other hearing officers that we're only
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to need for a short period of time
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
the efforts that we've done in
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
increasing our hearing officers
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
have really started to pay dividends
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic we were hearing
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh just under 200 cases per month
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh right now we have over 500 cases
 
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
uh right now we have over 500 cases
scheduled

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be heard in uh this month in may
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
as well as june and because of the
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
additional resources we've brought on
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
that are going through
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
the uh correspondence that it's received
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
in appeals
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
we have another 2500 appeals
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
that are able are ready to be scheduled
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
and are being added to the may
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
june and july dockets right now
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
so um we're going through our
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
our backlog that built up um i would say
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last month we're
 
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last month we're
going

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
through it much faster than we were
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
because of some additional resources we
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
brought on from
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
the vendor that supports our
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment hotline
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
i took 20 of those people and i put them
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
on correspondence review
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
so we receive a lot of correspondence in
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
our appeals section
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
about 30 of it are actual appeals so now
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
20 additional people going through that
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
they process
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
about 32 300 pieces of correspondence a
 
00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
about 32 300 pieces of correspondence a
week

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so that backlog of correspondence is
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
coming down
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
quickly that results in more cases being
 
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.870 align:start position:0%
quickly that results in more cases being
scheduled

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's the 2500 that are being added to
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
the docket right
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
now um and then
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
um that will also probably result in
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
an increased number of higher level
 
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
an increased number of higher level
administrative

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
appeals as well requests for reopening
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh cases to our appellate board
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll be prepared for that as well
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
so those are our appeals numbers
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
right now where things stand with regard
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
to overpayments
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
overpayments in terms of how they get
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
treated by the department
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
it depends on a host of factors whether
 
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.310 align:start position:0%
it depends on a host of factors whether
or not

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
the individual was determined to be at
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
fault and causing it
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not the dollars for which are
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
overpaid are from a state program or a
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so that all of that plays a role um
 
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
um so that all of that plays a role um
and

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
what is required to happen uh with
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
regard to an overpayment
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
so um what we have for overpayment in
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
terms of number of people
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the dollar amounts um for those that
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
are at fault so people that
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
made an inaccurate statement
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
to the department on their initial claim
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
or their weekly claims
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
um or were not uh truthful
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
um in the information that they provided
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
i can give you some examples of what
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
that looks like
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
we have about 18 million dollars in
 
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.389 align:start position:0%
we have about 18 million dollars in
overpayments

00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
overpayments
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
to that group it's about 12 000 people
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
they have received determinations from
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
if their overpayment is from the state
 
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.830 align:start position:0%
if their overpayment is from the state
ui

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
ui
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
program they are
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
notified in that determination
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
that they are not at fault in the
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
creation of it or they are at fault
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
so these people would have been
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
determined that they were at fault
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
in creating the overpayment and
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
that they are required to pay that back
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
and so they then have the opportunity to
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
file an appeal they have the opportunity
 
00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:19.269 align:start position:0%
file an appeal they have the opportunity
to

00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
seek forgiveness or compromise of that
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a state
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
overpayment and then if it's a federal
 
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.230 align:start position:0%
overpayment and then if it's a federal
overpayment

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
overpayment
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
we actually have to
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
the individuals if they don't go through
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
an appeal they have to go through
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
a the waiver process that's set up by
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
um so with those 12 000 that i just
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
discussed of individuals that are
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
determined to be at fault in the
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
creation of the overpayment about 18
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
so um they would not be eligible
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
for a waiver they can request a waiver
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
but if they're ultimately at fault
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
the waiver uh requirements and the
 
00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:02.710 align:start position:0%
the waiver uh requirements and the
federal

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines do not allow us to waive
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
those overpayments
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
so they need to be repaid and the the
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
examples of that
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
like i said it's based on inaccurate
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
information provided to the department
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
so these are
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
the most common examples are individuals
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
misinformed the department with regards
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
to their separation when they originally
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
to their separation when they originally
filed

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
filed
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
um so there were quite a few people um
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
that weren't working at the time
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh prior to the time when they started
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
filing in fact they stopped working
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
in many instances back towards the end
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
of 19
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
or maybe they stopped working at the
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
very beginning of 2020.
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
when they filed with the department they
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
would have represented to the department
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
that they had a coronavirus related
 
00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:54.470 align:start position:0%
that they had a coronavirus related
separation

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
separation
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
and that it was the pandemic as to why
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
they could not work
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
um and come and find out that once we
 
00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:01.350 align:start position:0%
um and come and find out that once we
would

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
have received information from the
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.470 align:start position:0%
have received information from the
employer

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
which in a lot of cases was not provided
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
timely because the employers were
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
dealing with their own problems right at
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
come to find out the individual would
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
have left employment
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
prior for a personal reason or to seek
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
other employment
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
and was not unemployed because of the
 
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.149 align:start position:0%
and was not unemployed because of the
pandemic

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore would have would have been
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
ineligible for
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
for benefits um similar are those
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh the self-employed individuals that
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
became eligible during the pandemic
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
previously they had no eligibility for
 
00:33:36.399 --> 00:33:37.990 align:start position:0%
previously they had no eligibility for
unemployment

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and initially when we were trying to set
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
them up and get them into the correct
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
benefit amounts
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
we required affidavits from
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
self-employed individuals
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
that uh where they would provide us what
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
their earnings were
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
for the prior calendar year so what they
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
had earned in
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
2019 and that was an affidavit
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then subsequent to that we received
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
federal guidance saying that all
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
individuals needed to provide
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
documentation to substantiate
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
their self-employment and so we then
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
required those individuals in most cases
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
to provide their 2019 schedule c's
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases what came in on their
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
2019 schedule c
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh was much lower than what they had
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
represented to the department in their
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
affidavit as to what their earnings were
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
the impact of that is that they would
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
have been set up at a higher weekly
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
benefit amount as a result of their
 
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.909 align:start position:0%
benefit amount as a result of their
affidavit

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
earnings and then when we get their
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
schedule c
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
showing much lower earnings or maybe no
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
earnings at
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
all then there is a gap
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of what their weekly benefit
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
amount should be
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
and they would be found overpaid uh for
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
that gap
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
so um those are um
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
the the common scenarios in that 18
 
00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
the the common scenarios in that 18
million

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's about one percent of total
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
benefits that have been paid out
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic i've
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
i understand uh where the focus lies on
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
some of
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
on some of this but it
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that the
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
department did get the dollars right
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the payments right in over 97
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
of the cases despite having a decades
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
worth of volume
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
um and a decade's worth of payments i do
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
think the department deserves a lot of
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
credit for getting it right
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
um over 97 of the time um and then with
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
these one percent
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
of people that are now found overpaid
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
that do have an opportunity to appeal
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to get through those as
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
they they are currently
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
required to repay those benefits and if
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
they appeal then that will be
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
delayed until that appeal decision um
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
gets issued now with the other with
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
other folks that are not at fault
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
in creating their overpayment oh of it
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
one important point i forgot to make
 
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.589 align:start position:0%
one important point i forgot to make
their

00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
um the program breakdown for that 18
 
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.190 align:start position:0%
um the program breakdown for that 18
million

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
as the same for the folks that are not
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
at fault
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
about 20 of those dollars are from the
 
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:17.829 align:start position:0%
about 20 of those dollars are from the
state

00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund so about 80 percent
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
of overpayment dollars are from a
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
federal source
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
most of that sixty percent of it is from
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
the federal enhancement
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
um you know when that was six hundred
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
dollars a week and now three hundred
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
dollars a week
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
so eighty percent of the of the
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
overpayment dollars are federal
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
source dollars the other 20 are sourced
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
from the state trust fund
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
um getting to the uh
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not at fault
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
um in the creation of the overpayment so
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's in most
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
cases agency error we're dealing with
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
about 8
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
000 people about 25 million dollars
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
so there are some instances where that
 
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
so there are some instances where that
is

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
attributed to employer error where we
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
could have been provided with inaccurate
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
earnings information but most of that
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to misrepresent that and
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that that's
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
by large measure employer error it's not
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
most of that is
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
agency error and so that's about 25
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars of agency error so that
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
individuals receive money
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
they should not have received that they
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
were not eligible for
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
um but um through agency error
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
they they did get eligibility
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
now with regard to those types of
 
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
now with regard to those types of
overpayments

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
overpayments
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
if it is sourced from state ui the
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
individual is notified right in the
 
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.150 align:start position:0%
individual is notified right in the
determination

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
saying hey you're not at fault in the
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
creation of this overpayment you don't
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
have to pay it back
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay we do that by state statute in
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
and rule on fault federal
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
overpayments states are not allowed to
 
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.470 align:start position:0%
overpayments states are not allowed to
waive

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
waive
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
or forgive the overpayment in that
 
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
or forgive the overpayment in that
initial

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
determination the state is required to
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
follow federal waiver procedures where
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
we actually have to look at each case
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
individually first we have to look to
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
see whether or not they are
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
at fault or not if they are not at fault
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
we can proceed
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
to the second prong of the federal
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
waiver test which requires us to look at
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
their financial circumstances
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
and to determine whether or not
 
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
and to determine whether or not
repayment

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
would create a financial burden on the
 
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
would create a financial burden on the
individual

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
so that is not something that can happen
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
in that initial determination because we
 
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.069 align:start position:0%
in that initial determination because we
don't

00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
have a financial affidavit yet from the
 
00:38:47.359 --> 00:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
have a financial affidavit yet from the
individual

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
so those individuals that are not at
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
fault in the creation of the overpayment
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
they receive instruction
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
on how to go about requesting a waiver
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
that we have a form available to them on
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
our website
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
along with the financial affidavit they
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
are then required to submit both of
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
those to the department
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then we look at that to make sure
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
that they meet that federal standard
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
so um it's a it's a time-intensive
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
process on on those waivers
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to deal with those
 
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to deal with those
waivers

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
in a blanket fashion um but
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
u.s department of labor has come back to
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
states and says wheat and said we
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
cannot do that we have to look at them
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
one by one
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
so we are doing that right now our legal
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
section is processing
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
these waiver requests um and we're
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
moving through them
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
as as quickly as we can right now and
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
individuals as they uh receive those
 
00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:48.390 align:start position:0%
individuals as they uh receive those
notices

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
notices
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
they get the instruction on going to the
 
00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:51.510 align:start position:0%
they get the instruction on going to the
uh

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
the appeal route or going through the
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
waiver route
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll be issuing those decisions as
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
on waivers um so that uh
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
so all in all like i said in over 97
 
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.430 align:start position:0%
so all in all like i said in over 97
percent

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
of payments they were paid correctly
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
to the right people uh to eligible
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
people in the right amount
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
about one percent of payments were paid
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of the department being
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
provided inaccurate misleading
 
00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
provided inaccurate misleading
information

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
in most cases unless it's reversed on
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
appeal those people will have to pay
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
those dollars back
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then in about one and a half percent
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
of those payments
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
um those people were paid they shouldn't
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
have been paid
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's the department's fault and either
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
they are told in the determination that
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay it back if it's
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
state ui
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then if it's a federal source
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
payment they are then given instruction
 
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.150 align:start position:0%
payment they are then given instruction
on

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
how to go about requesting a waiver um i
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
would expect in those cases where the
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
person is not
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
at fault as long as they complete the
 
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.430 align:start position:0%
at fault as long as they complete the
form

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
and they complete the financial
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit i suspect that
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the overwhelming majority of those
 
00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
in the overwhelming majority of those
cases

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
that the waiver is going to be granted
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
but again we have to do those
 
00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:09.750 align:start position:0%
but again we have to do those
individually

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
individually
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
um and i'll i'll stop there i know
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of information
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
um so i'll try not to keep on going
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
on this topic but uh mr chairman if the
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
obviously i'll stick around for as long
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
as you need me to answer questions
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um we do
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
recognize that you got 97
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
of this right you were criticized for
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
not paying quick enough and now you're
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
going to be criticized for if you paid
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
made a mistake that you uh
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
are asking for your money back so um
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
what's the uh expression a good no good
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
deed goes unpunished
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
so we do appreciate that actually this
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
is very complex
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
and um people have a lot of questions
 
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:51.990 align:start position:0%
and um people have a lot of questions
and

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
and don't understand things so i have a
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
number of questions but i want to open
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
it up to
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
the members um first
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
are there any hints or any questions
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
here within the lob
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh first representative seaworth
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
followed by representative sullivan
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i want to
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
follow up on something you said
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
obviously um what you talked about is
 
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.990 align:start position:0%
obviously um what you talked about is
addressing

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
the concern from the state side of it
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
a constituent is going to be their
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
biggest concern
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
is if they were delayed in getting
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
payment or otherwise
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
had a problem on that end
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
do you have kind of an overview
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
the squeaky wheel that's the only thing
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
i heard about but do you have an
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
overview statistically
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
of what happened in terms
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
of delays in the normal processing
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
where people who filed might have seen
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances in the time
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
it took to get payment
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative i would
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'd compare new hampshire's record
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
of timeliness and payment against any
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
other state um
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
as chairman infantine had pointed out
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
the criticism
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
early on was not getting the dollars out
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh fast enough even though we were
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
exceeding our
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
timeliness in terms of how quickly we
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
got dollars out
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
as compared to the great recession even
 
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.630 align:start position:0%
as compared to the great recession even
though

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
our claim loads were um
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
in most instances quadruple quintuple
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
um that which we were seeing in the
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
great recession so i
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
so i think depending on the
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances of someone's claim
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
really dictates how long it takes if
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
they have a complicated claim with a big
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
payout from their employer that needs to
 
00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:50.230 align:start position:0%
payout from their employer that needs to
be

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
factored in by someone looking at their
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
claim and making sure that they don't
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
get paid
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
too much or are too early because of
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
that payout or they have complicated
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances of their separation
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
those types of claims always take a
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
little bit longer
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
but in a lot of in a lot of these cases
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
um with the particular with the agency
 
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.630 align:start position:0%
um with the particular with the agency
error

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
error
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
overpayments and the 25 million that's
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
because we paid too fast
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
um we we you know in hindsight if um i'd
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
held on to those claims for those 8 000
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
claims for
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
a few more weeks for another month and a
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
half or so maybe i would have been
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
had the information i needed from their
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
employer to determine that they weren't
 
00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
employer to determine that they weren't
eligible

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
but you know we were under a lot of
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
pressure to issue payments quickly and
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we did
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the best information we had
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
available at the time
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
knowing what people were dealing with
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
during the early stages of the pandemic
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh right now with the people that are
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
filing like i had pointed out before we
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
have both 34
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
35 000 people that are filing right now
 
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.589 align:start position:0%
35 000 people that are filing right now
um

00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of timing i just had i looked
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
at a
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
claim two weeks ago a very complicated
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
claim someone who had been filing during
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
the early stages of the pandemic went
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh complicated reason for not continuing
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
had a big pay up from that employer had
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
part-time earnings as they came back
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
and when they came back we had them back
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
in pace status within two weeks
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty good um considering
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh that we're still dealing with uh
 
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.190 align:start position:0%
uh that we're still dealing with uh
volume

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
volume
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's you know nine times that which we
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
had prior to the pandemic
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
so um you know we've we've looked at
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
timeliness compared
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
for the early stages of the pandemic
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
compared to the great recession
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
we know we paid faster uh the fact that
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
we had 25 million dollars in agency
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
error overpayments
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
that shows you that we were we were
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
paying a little bit too fast
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
in some cases um i do uh i i do think
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
that when you look at total
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
payments made by states and the
 
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.670 align:start position:0%
payments made by states and the
percentage

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
of improper payments or overpayments
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we got wrong
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
when you compare new hampshire against
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else and we and you can see that
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
we've got 97.6
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh of those dollars correct i think that
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
will stand up well against anybody else
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
i would caution against looking at some
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the reports that are available from
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
us department of labor right now
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
most of those are inaccurate uh and
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
itself you know they'll admit that those
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
are inaccurate because
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the reporting mechanisms that those
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
reports were based off
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
in all states had those shut off
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
intermittently throughout 2020
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
so those are not accurate portrayals of
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
how quickly appeals are being dealt with
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sullivan
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
followed by representative cahill
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
good to see you uh deputy commissioner
 
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.069 align:start position:0%
good to see you uh deputy commissioner
um

00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
the uh could you explain what the
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
financial guidelines are for the federal
 
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
financial guidelines are for the federal
waivers

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
what what determines whether somebody
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
gets the waiver or not
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
so the um there's not a a time deadline
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the waiver itself so when someone
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
receives a determination
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
that includes an overpayment from one of
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
the federal programs they have
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
they have language in there i'm
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
explaining them the waiver process
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
we have it on our website so there's not
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
unlike an appeal
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
an appeal someone has to file that
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
appeal within 14 days of their
 
00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:35.430 align:start position:0%
appeal within 14 days of their
determination

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
with a waiver there's not a time limit
 
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:38.549 align:start position:0%
with a waiver there's not a time limit
the

00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
standard that is in place for
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
considering those waivers
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
and determines whether the state can
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
grant it or reject it
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
first we have to determine whether the
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
individual is at fault
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
in creation of the overpayment um the
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
second prong if the person
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
is not at fault we then look at their
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
financial circumstances
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
and if repayment would create a
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
financial hardship
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
we are allowed to grant it if um
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
the person made
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
payments and decisions based on having
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
received those benefits
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have otherwise done
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
had they not received those benefits
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's another grounds for finding that
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
they meet the financial
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh part of the test and then
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh the last prong of that test is
 
00:48:30.319 --> 00:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
uh the last prong of that test is
whether

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
a repayment would be unconscionable
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
um not really any definition around that
 
00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:37.990 align:start position:0%
um not really any definition around that
um

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
states are left to implement it
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
as they see as they see fit but again
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
i think as long as someone is not at
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
fault um
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'm hard-pressed to think of a scenario
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
that they would not
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
also meet the financial uh burden
 
00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:55.670 align:start position:0%
also meet the financial uh burden
portion

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i understand what the
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.069 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i understand what the
um

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
what you would have to see in someone's
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit to determine that
 
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.069 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit to determine that
they

00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
would not be financially uh harmed by
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
making repayment they have to be
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
here or what what what's the criteria
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
well you know we have to we have to know
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
their financial circumstances
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's been clearly required by the
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
feds and the guidance that they've
 
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:33.510 align:start position:0%
feds and the guidance that they've
issued

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
issued
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
so we accomplished that by obtaining a
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit which
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
is in the world of financial affidavits
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty short one
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
this is a two-page financial affidavit
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
where we look at household revenue
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
and income coming in we look at
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
household assets and then we look at
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
household expenses
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we do is we compare
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
monthly income against monthly expenses
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's our first review to see whether
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
or not we can grant the
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
the waiver then secondarily
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
we look to see whether the person has
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
described any decisions that they've
 
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
described any decisions that they've
made

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
as a result of receiving benefits that
 
00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:15.750 align:start position:0%
as a result of receiving benefits that
um

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have otherwise done if
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
they hadn't received them
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
maybe they paid a large amount of credit
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
card debt
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
maybe they paid off um a
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
they paid a semester of college tuition
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
for one of their children differently
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
than they would have otherwise done um
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
those types of circumstances are looked
 
00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.109 align:start position:0%
those types of circumstances are looked
at

00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
that would be grounds for someone
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
meeting that financial
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
test and then the last provision being
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
repayment would be unconscionable um you
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
know i'm careful in how this gets
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
applied because you know some people
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
just because you're you might be in good
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
financial condition i don't think that
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
should require you to pay back a benefit
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
that was paid to you as a result of the
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
agency screwing up
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so just because you might have more
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
income than someone else i don't think
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
that should be grounds for denial and it
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
won't be in how new hampshire
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
implements it but we look at all um
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
all portions of that spectrum so we look
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
at whether
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to create financial
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
hardship and having to pay it back
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
we look at whether or not you made
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that uh in reliance upon
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
receipt of those dollars that you
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have otherwise made
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
um and then that catch-all at the end
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not repayment would be
 
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.829 align:start position:0%
whether or not repayment would be
unconscionable

00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
unconscionable
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's not our test right it's the it's
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
the federal test
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're required to implement it um prior
 
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
we're required to implement it um prior
to

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
forgiving repayment of those
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
overpayments from federally sourced
 
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.349 align:start position:0%
overpayments from federally sourced
programs

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
i would rather be able to waive it right
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
in that initial determination like we do
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
with state ui
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
but if we do that we've already been
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
told that it would be
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
held to be out of compliance with the
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
feds and we would not be doing those
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
people any favors because we
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
we would then be subject on audit to
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
having to go back
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
and have the people go through the
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
stephen one more question yes but yes i
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
guess based on the third criteria
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest that all that would
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
be unconscionable
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
um representative you and i are on the
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
on the same page
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh there was uh the state of texas tried
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
following one of their because these
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
federal programs are
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
based on federal disaster unemployment
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
texas had
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
several recent disasters that required
 
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.150 align:start position:0%
several recent disasters that required
payments

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
under their under federal disaster
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance programs
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
they tried doing that on on one of the
 
00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:52.630 align:start position:0%
they tried doing that on on one of the
instances

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
and tried saying that by very nature of
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
someone needing unemployment
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
that they are just assumed to have met
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
the financial burden
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
and they granted the waivers to everyone
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
the feds used that as an example of what
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
states are not
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
allowed to do in kind of their shot
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
across the bow
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
when they put out their guidance on
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
one more question of the 25 million um
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
that was not the fault of the
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
recipient how much of that was federal
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
and how much for the state
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a it's a 80 20 split
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
there so 80
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
is from a federal source 20 20 of that
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
is from the state uh so we're looking at
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
about five million dollars
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
from that total that would be
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
that would have come from the state
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cahill thank
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you mr lavers
 
00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:54.069 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you mr lavers
uh

00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
over this period you and i have had many
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
correspondences and
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
conversations and uh i i also want to
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
recognize that the department and you
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the department have done a
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
great job under very difficult
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances and they
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
and to add that those claims that were
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
delayed were paid retroactively in full
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
so those people were made whole although
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit inconvenienced because of
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
the delay
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
quite understandable under the deluge
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
that you've experienced
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
so it appears as though with the state
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
with the state part and perhaps even
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
with the federal as long as you were not
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
at fault if you didn't give improper
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
information inaccurate information
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to be okay is that correct
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think that's an accurate
 
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think that's an accurate
statement

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
um you know what happens next
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
is determined by uh which program from
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
which you were overpaid
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
um easy if you were from state ui we
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
forgive it in that determination
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
if it's from and in most of these cases
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's not just state ui because in most
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
weeks you also had that federal
 
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.109 align:start position:0%
weeks you also had that federal
enhancement

00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
enhancement
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
um in play as well so the federal
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
portion of it is
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
is more complicated because of that
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
waiver process
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it should be
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
the same result
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
an individual overpaid from a state
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
program versus an individual overpaid
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
from a federal program
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
if they are not at fault the end result
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
should be the same
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
and they are not required to make
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
restitution to the state
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
um i think it's just how i go about
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
overseeing this part of the process i
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's inherently
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
unfair to require someone not at fault
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
in um an overpayment uh being created
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
to then be expected to repay that they
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the agency made an error they
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
received dollars to which they felt and
 
00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
received dollars to which they felt and
and

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
thought they were eligible um
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's just it's unfortunate that the
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
process for waiving those
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
for the federal portion um requires
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
additional steps on the part of the
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
individual if there was a way of
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
avoiding that i would jump all over it
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
and there's not so we're doing the best
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
we can with the rules that
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
have been provided to us by the feds
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll move those as quickly as we
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
can and we've been
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
trying to make information available to
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
those individuals so that they know once
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
they submit a waiver request
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we acknowledge receipt of it
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
we tell them we're reviewing it we'll be
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
getting a decision
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
out to them they're not responsible for
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
making payment
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
during that time period so we try to be
 
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.750 align:start position:0%
during that time period so we try to be
clear

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
with that information that we put out to
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
them and we've had that type of
 
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
them and we've had that type of
information

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
out to the public since november of 2020
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
just letting them know that they're
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
that in a waiver situation that it's
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
being taken and that's under
 
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.710 align:start position:0%
being taken and that's under
consideration

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't you don't have to do anything um
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
until you hear back from us
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh in regards to the uh the gig workers
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
self-employed and other you know
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
employers who are kind of
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
closed down or having difficulty
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
responding to your your questions about
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
claims uh
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
is that considered uh faults of the
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
the employee of the claimant if the
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
information didn't come back and then
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
you paid out several thousand dollars
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh and then you know maybe they hadn't
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
really misrepresented anything it's just
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps a misunderstanding or perhaps
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
their vacation pay was paid to them
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
in some cases they didn't understand
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
so if it's a situation where someone is
 
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
so if it's a situation where someone is
um

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
they're they are truthful to the
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
department on their initial filing
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
but because of information we
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
subsequently receive
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
from their employer that they're
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
determined to be overpaid that person
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
would be without fault
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
in creation of that overpayment that
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be a combination of agency and
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
employer error
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
in that type of situation depending on
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
the timing of when the information came
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
in but as long as the
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
as long as the info as long as the
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
person was
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
accurate and truthful with the
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
department they wouldn't have
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
a problem in that type of situation
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%

back in april of 2020

uh while the department was seeing a
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
dramatically increased volume
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
um there was giants that was put out by
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
then attorney general mcdonald
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
regarding um governor snyder's order
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
on uh a freeze of
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
investments in foreclosures uh
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's guidance
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
specified that
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of the state of
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
emergency which we thought was going to
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
be a lot sooner
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh that those rents and mortgages were
 
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
uh that those rents and mortgages were
tactically

00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
tactically
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
full and there was no protection for
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
those folks
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh was there any discussion between
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of uh between the
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and the department
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
of labor
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh surrounding the backlog of claims
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
and how you know something like that
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
a massive financial obligation like that
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
might be unattainable for folks that
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
were still waiting for queens
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
so there um
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
at no point in time have we had a
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
massive backlog
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
of claims we've had a high volume of
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
claims throughout
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
including um uh obviously
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
april of 2020 um but
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
i could go through the payment totals by
 
01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
i could go through the payment totals by
week

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh for that back then um and it would
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
show you that we were paying out a lot
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
real fast um but with regard to your
 
01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
real fast um but with regard to your
question

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
um i did not have uh any conversation
 
01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:02.470 align:start position:0%
um i did not have uh any conversation
with

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh then attorney general mcdonald or uh
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
with the governor with regard to that
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
your question was did you know any
 
01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:12.789 align:start position:0%
your question was did you know any
between

01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
the governor's office attorney general
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
or the department of labor this is
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
department employment security so
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
did you mean to say that yes okay all
 
01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:20.549 align:start position:0%
did you mean to say that yes okay all
right

01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
and you have a follow-up yeah um
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
would there be any obstacles that you
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
could think of
 
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
um regarding permanently accepting
 
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.470 align:start position:0%
um regarding permanently accepting
elderly

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
to gay workers um in the face of
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the question uh just to restate it to
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
make sure i have it correctly
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
so the question would be are there any
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
obstacles to extending
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment eligibility for gig workers
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
i know what a gig worker is it's a guy
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
that maybe worked for uber or something
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
could someone tell me what the acronym
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
really means
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
does gig stand for something actually i
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
think it actually comes from
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
like back when musicians would play out
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
they say
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay it's just one or two nights
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
sorry commissioner i just wanted to
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
figure to figure out what that reading
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know what the heck it meant
 
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know what the heck it meant
so

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
all right um when we talk about gig
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
workers for new hampshire
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about non-covered
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
employment for the most part
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
so self-employed are are part of that
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
so um prior to the pandemic and the
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
changes that were made
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
only those individuals that were in
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
covered employment
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
so most w-2 employment would be
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
people that would be eligible for
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
receipt of unemployment benefits if they
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
had a qualifying separation and had
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
enough earnings
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
so the cares act expanded that
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
to both non-covered employment gig
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
workers and
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
self-employed so right now the program
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
under which self-employed and gig
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
workers are paid benefits is the
 
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.349 align:start position:0%
workers are paid benefits is the
pandemic

01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance program or pua
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
that was the federal cares act program
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
that created it
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as in all other states
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
signed a state agreement with the u.s
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
to participate in that program as we did
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
for the federal extension as we did
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
for the fpuc program the federal
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
enhancement program
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
right now that program is scheduled to
 
01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.710 align:start position:0%
right now that program is scheduled to
continue

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
until september 4th that was the
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
continuation from the american rescue
 
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.150 align:start position:0%
continuation from the american rescue
plan

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire participates in that
 
01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:49.829 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire participates in that
program

01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
by virtue of having signed the state
 
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.750 align:start position:0%
by virtue of having signed the state
agreement

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
and it continues because of the american
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
rescue plan so those people
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
right now continue to receive benefits
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
through the pua program without a pua
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
program they would not be eligible for
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
benefits and state unemployment no other
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions here in the lob
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%

as well so we'll be increasing that
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
monthly output
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
to may
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
june july probably some of those into
 
01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
june july probably some of those into
august

01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
august
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
and then um like the state did with its
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination system as they got more
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
capacity they bumped up appointments
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing the same as more law
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
firms come on um
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be increasing the or we'll be
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
bumping up
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
appeal hearings to be um earlier
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
right now um so in terms of uh
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
appeal requests um those go
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
into for the for the overwhelming
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
majority of cases people
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
email our appeals inbox right when they
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
get their determination they see oh i
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
have 14 days this is how i can do it can
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
be us mail or it can be email
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
here's the email address boom i'm going
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
to submit my
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
appeal right now we are reviewing appeal
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
requests that came
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
in in the first half of march
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so here we are um at the beginning
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
of may
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
um that is uh uh that's the backlog that
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
i had spoken about that we are going
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
through about 3 000 plus
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
pieces of correspondence a week right
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
now with the 20 additional people we
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
brought on from our vendor that supports
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
our hotline
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that's actually um that's going uh
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's ramped up real fast since we've
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
brought those people on so we're
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
will be through march i would say within
 
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.510 align:start position:0%
will be through march i would say within
probably

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
another week to week and a half and
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be moving into april
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
and those hearings are getting um
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're getting back filled into may
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
june july then we'll be into august
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
and then our effort will be to try to
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
move those up that
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
get pushed out initially when we bring
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
on more law firms to supplement hearing
 
01:08:59.679 --> 01:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
on more law firms to supplement hearing
officers

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
then those hearings are going to get
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
moved up as quickly as we can
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
while those people have a pending appeal
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
they are notified
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
by the department both on our website
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
and with
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
information that's sent out to them in
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
the determination
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
that if there's an overpayment that is
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
that's associated with that they're not
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for the overpayment while
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
their appeal is pending
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
we had initially um we had
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
systems in place that were not very
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
easily to shut off or to change with
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
regard to interest accrual
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
things of that nature and so initially
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
what we told people
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
um despite what you might have read in
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
the union leader today
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
what we told people back in november of
 
01:09:45.679 --> 01:09:46.470 align:start position:0%
what we told people back in november of
2020

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
um you know in a real hidden spot right
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
front and center on our website
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
we told them we said hey ignore any
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
determination that you get
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
regarding your overpayment if you have
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
an appeal pending including interest
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want them to think
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
that we were requiring them to repay
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
while their appeal was pending so we put
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
that information out in november of 2020
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
we've since shut that off it took a
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
little while
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
to get the programming changed correctly
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
without screwing other things up
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
but we have that shut off right now so
 
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.070 align:start position:0%
but we have that shut off right now so
that

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
individuals including people that don't
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
even file an appeal
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
right now they're not getting a
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
demand notice they're not getting a
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
monthly billing statement
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
from us because we want to get through
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
the backlog of appeals
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
before we turn that functionality back
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
on so we've tried to be real open
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
and transparent since november of last
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
year with regard to that so people don't
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
think we're pursuing collection or
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
having their debt accrue interest while
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
they have an appeal pending
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
cahill thank you again mr chairman mr
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
lavis uh so
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to refer to uh my
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues earlier question about the
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
gig workers and
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
the issue there is that uh if you're a
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
gig worker
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
either self-employed or for uber or door
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
dash or something like
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
no one's paying in into the system is
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
correct so there they do not have
 
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.669 align:start position:0%
correct so there they do not have
eligibility

01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so they only have eligibility right
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
now under federal pua which is 100
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
paid by the federal government if
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
pua were gone um if that program were to
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
go away
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
those individuals would not have
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility in the state
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh ui system because the trust fund is
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
made up of tax payments
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
from uh covered employers
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
and those the dollars that they pay in
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
in taxes are the dollars that we pay out
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
and self-employed individuals have never
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
been eligible for unemployment benefits
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
until this pandemic and um once the pua
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
program goes away
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
they would lose eligibility under
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
current policy
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
um unless obviously um uh the
 
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.149 align:start position:0%
um unless obviously um uh the
legislature

01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
made a change to that policy in terms of
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
who's eligible and and who
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%

support um
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
for some of the local businesses that we
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
had that were having issues with their
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment their employees so again
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for all that assistance you
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
gave us um during this troubling time
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
um the question i have and i'm sure
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
the chairman will cover some of them
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
that i have as well um is when will the
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund be replenished
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
to the 300 million at the current rates
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so i'll i'll caution uh too much
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
reliance on what i'm going to say about
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
the trust fund forecast because
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
um our experience over the course of the
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
really um makes you question any type of
 
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.070 align:start position:0%
really um makes you question any type of
forecast

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
forecast
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond certainly anything
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
beyond a year
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
is tough in terms of a reliability index
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
so right now we're forecasting as i
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
showed earlier the trust fund to
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
end 2021 in the range of between 65
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
million to 84 million
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
good news is that we remain solvent
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
without borrowing bad news is that we're
 
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.070 align:start position:0%
without borrowing bad news is that we're
only

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
at 65 to 84 million at the end of 2021.
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we are anticipating further growth
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the fund in 2022 based upon
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
the additional hiring that we expect to
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
take place
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
um and less reliance on
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
less reliance by individuals for
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit payments those
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
numbers have been coming down
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
week to week like i said before we have
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
about 19 000 people that are currently
 
01:14:23.199 --> 01:14:24.310 align:start position:0%
about 19 000 people that are currently
filing

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
filing
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the state ui program
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of a longer range forecast in
 
01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:30.709 align:start position:0%
in terms of a longer range forecast in
um

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
the when to expect the fund to
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
next uh to be at that 250 million dollar
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
level which triggers the first
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
rate reduction to employers i think
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
at probably about three years before the
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
fund is able to grow
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
back up to that point and then
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
in order to then achieve the additional
 
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.750 align:start position:0%
in order to then achieve the additional
solvency

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
solvency
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
thresholds of 275 and 300
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
you could be looking at upwards of five
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.550 align:start position:0%
you could be looking at upwards of five
years

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
but again a lot of question marks there
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the type of growth
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we see um following um
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
the dramatic loss of a
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
large segment of our labor force during
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
so it will all be determined by how
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
quickly new hampshire continues to
 
01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.470 align:start position:0%
quickly new hampshire continues to
recover

01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you my recollection the last time
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i was here
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
through this it did take five years
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
understand we're only
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
employers are only paying tax on the
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
first fourteen thousand dollars
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the individual's wage so it takes a
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
while to catch up
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
once that that's why the first quarter
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
of every year
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
is the biggest revenue uh income period
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
for the department after that when
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
people reach that 14
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
000 they're no longer paying the
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax so the second third and
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
fourth quarters
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
money usually goes out more than it
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
the questions i have for you um mr
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner are some things we've
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
already discussed but i think it's
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
important for
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
people who are listening either online
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
or here in the committee
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of the scenarios that occurred you
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
had two individuals not getting along
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
very well
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
in one employer and the employer tried
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with that
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
the one of the employees quit uh their
 
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.430 align:start position:0%
the one of the employees quit uh their
job

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then filed for unemployment received
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
the unemployment the owner
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
was shocked because well i have a job
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
for you and you have to
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
be available to have a job and i have
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
the job
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
why are you paying him unemployment that
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
really had to do with
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
federal money because the individual
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
could claim that they had to stay home
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
to take care of their children and such
 
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
to take care of their children and such
that

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
the employer was not going to be charged
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
for unemployment on their tax rate for
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
that individual
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that an accurate portrayal of that
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
of what goes on in that circumstance yes
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's uh you've what you've said is
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
very much accurate so because of the pua
 
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
very much accurate so because of the pua
program

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
um someone could have been offered
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
suitable employment but
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
they uh qualified for pua because of one
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
of those cares act related reasons in
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
your scenario it was to care for
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
a remote learner that's
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
largely gone right now with the
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
governor's requirement for in-person
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
learning effective back as of april 19th
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
so that population of people that are
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
filing under pua
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
because they are the primary caregiver
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
for a student
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
whose school is closed schools are open
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we've been providing that
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
information to
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that have been certifying to
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
they've been receiving quite a bit of
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
information from us
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
again trying to achieve compliance
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
through education
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
and we've been reminding them the
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
guard rails of that type of eligibility
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
but once you're once the school is open
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
no longer an area of eligibility for
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
someone under pua
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
they could have other eligibility but
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be um
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
some that would not be the reason they
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
would now qualify for pua
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
since that job is still open and i
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
believe it's the 23rd of this month
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving unemployment are
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
now going to be required again to go
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
look for
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
a job and considering we have people
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
begging for workers in many of the
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
service industries
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
um do you expect
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
that as of that 23rd date if i have the
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
correct date
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
may 23rd there will be more people
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
coming in to
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
be available for employment i
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
i hope so um you know it's we
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
we turned off the work search
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
requirement for a year
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
um it feels like a lot longer than that
 
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.470 align:start position:0%
um it feels like a lot longer than that
um

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
what i mean work search is a fundamental
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
pillar of the unemployment program i
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to deal with you
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
for as short a duration as possible i
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
want to get you back to work
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
our re-employment services bureau is a
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
critical uh component of what the
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
department is
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
all about and i'm excited to get back to
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
a point where we can really be
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
helping individuals take advantage of
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of opportunity that is out
 
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.310 align:start position:0%
the amount of opportunity that is out
there

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
with it seems like every business that i
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
drive by is hiring
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
right now we had a job fair three weeks
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
ago virtual job fair for seacoast and
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
southern tier employers
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
100 employers 3 400 openings
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
138 people showed up to look for work
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's not sustainable it's not healthy
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's not good i'm not doing the
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
individual a favor
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
by allowing them to easily continue to
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
connect collect
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment long-term unemployment's
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
not good for the individual
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
or the economy so getting back
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
to having a work search requirement
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
where they're they're not being required
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
to start working they're being required
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
to start
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking and to participate in activities
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
and make contacts with hiring employers
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
so that they can get back
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
into suitable employment we're going to
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
be doing a lot to educate
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
people in the unemployment system over
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the next few weeks
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
every single one of them is going to be
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a virtual and
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
or virtual workshop where we're going to
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
take about a half an hour review
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
work search requirements going to go
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
over the screens that they're going to
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
be seeing again
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
explaining to them what uh
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
employment contacts look like what act
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
what types of activities qualify
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
make sure they understand about all of
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
the 10
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
virtual job fairs that we have over the
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
course of this month that is going to
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
cover every single part
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
of our state with hiring employers being
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
showcase their positions to people that
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
now have a work search requirement
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be showing them and
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
going over all of the tools
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
our offices are going to be back open as
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
of this coming monday
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh where we can people can come in and
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
use our computers and our resource
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
centers to search for work
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's really getting back to
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
that the unemployment program is
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
intended to function
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
states were prior to the pandemic states
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
were measured against one another
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
as to who had the shortest duration of
 
01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.790 align:start position:0%
as to who had the shortest duration of
unemployment

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and that's because we're a
 
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
and and that's because we're a
short-term

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
temporary financial bridge to get
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
someone back to work
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're going to get back
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
to doing and i'm excited to be able to
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
start working with people again and i'll
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
be out in all of our offices
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
starting next week so that we can
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
effectively and safely
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
work with with the public again
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
a few more quick ones you mentioned in
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony or your discussion
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
that you waived the requirement for
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
non-profits to reimburse
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment which they would normally
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
have to do was that the same for
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities or was that just for the
 
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.270 align:start position:0%
municipalities or was that just for the
non-profits

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
it was the same for municipalities as
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you when you talked about the
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
hearings that you're having uh
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of what representative warden
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
talked about if there's 8 000 out there
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
right now you're only doing 500 a month
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know that would take you know 16
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
months to take care of obviously you're
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
hiring more individuals
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
how many of these hearings are for oh
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
just ballpark it overpayment versus
 
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.470 align:start position:0%
just ballpark it overpayment versus
denied

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
currently denied for new um
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
people requesting yeah i would i would
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
say the um
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
um it's an important distinction they
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
make cause some of these are people that
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
just denied and they disagree with the
 
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.470 align:start position:0%
just denied and they disagree with the
denial

01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
denial
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
um rather than give you a figure that
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
positive about let me get back to you on
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
that and give you a rough breakdown
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
of that um one just one quick thing on
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
that mr chairman
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a tremendous increase in the
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
number of people using the unemployment
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:11.830 align:start position:0%
number of people using the unemployment
system

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
and people that receive determinations
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that they don't agree with that they
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
then file an appeal so the number of
 
01:23:16.719 --> 01:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
then file an appeal so the number of
people

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
has caused a spike in the number of
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
appeals being filed
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
but one thing that gets overlooked um
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's also
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
increased the amount of appeals being
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
filed is
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
these federal programs require us to
 
01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:31.510 align:start position:0%
these federal programs require us to
issue

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
more determinations per person
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
so before someone can get put on federal
 
01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:38.550 align:start position:0%
so before someone can get put on federal
pua

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
pua
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have to issue them a determination
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
denying them state ui
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
some people they don't quite understand
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
how that process works we've tried to
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
explain it they file an appeal
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
of that those appeal requests then have
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
to get reviewed
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
they then have to get scheduled might
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
not be intentional the person might
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
have already moved on to pua but it
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
takes time to review all that and it
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
bogs things down
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of extra determinations
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we have to issue
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
um on each of these claims which also
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
increases that claim load and that
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
appeals load
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
my point mr was that hopefully um
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
more deference to those that are denied
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
that are looking for unemployment versus
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
the ones that were
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
trying for the repayments for um which
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know obviously one is more urgent
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
than the other the
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
the next round the next question i have
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
really has to do with this repayment
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's clear from hearing you today that
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
we have the state amount and then we
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
have the federal amount
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
and we have these individuals who um 8
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
000 individuals
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
you feel it is not their fault why they
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
were overpaid
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the situation that has been brought
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
to my attention is an individual
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh had a hearing was determined he was
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
it was not his fault he was overpaid he
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
had to provide
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the federal affidavit individuals like
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
why do i have to fight provide the
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
affidavit you already said i
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
i don't uh it's not my fault so then
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime he is still on
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
um unemployment a certain amount was
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
taken out of his unemployment check this
 
01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.669 align:start position:0%
taken out of his unemployment check this
week

01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
to still pay it off even though it was
 
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
to still pay it off even though it was
waived

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
waived
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
so obviously that's from the federal
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
part and
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
so you have to take care of both the
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
state park
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
and the federal park you make one
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
determination from the state
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
based on your own set of rules then you
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
have to follow the federal set of rules
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to waive that part and while
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
you're waiting for that
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
the state still has the ability to try
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
to collect some of that money back
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
from um so in the in the situation uh mr
 
01:25:50.159 --> 01:25:50.709 align:start position:0%
from um so in the in the situation uh mr
chairman

01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
with someone that i think you describe
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
someone who had
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
had had their appeal hearing and they
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
were determined to be without fault
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
right that person um unless there's
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
another overpayment
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe a pre-existing
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
overpayment from prior to the pandemic
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
or something else going on they
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
their benefits being offset in fact
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
i'm more than happy if you could send
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
that one to me so i can look at it
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
because we've actually shut off
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
our offset capability right now
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
however even if we hadn't shut off the
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
offset capability
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
every individual when they receive the
 
01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.350 align:start position:0%
every individual when they receive the
determination

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
that finds them overpaid in that
 
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
that finds them overpaid in that
determination

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
there are instructions explaining to
 
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.229 align:start position:0%
there are instructions explaining to
them

01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
that if they don't appeal and they
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
continue to file
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
that their future payments could be
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
offset to repay their debt
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
and if they would like to avoid that
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
they're given instruction
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
right there right in that decision
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
saying contact this number
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they will work with you on
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
establishing a payment agreement
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is consistent with your current
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
financial ability to pay
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
so it's always a situation that can be
 
01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
so it's always a situation that can be
avoided

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've currently shut off our offset
 
01:27:08.159 --> 01:27:09.669 align:start position:0%
we've currently shut off our offset
functionality

01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
right now but as long as someone reaches
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
out and follows that instruction on the
 
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.950 align:start position:0%
out and follows that instruction on the
determination

01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
they should not be having um that a
 
01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.070 align:start position:0%
they should not be having um that a
large

01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
portion of their unemployment benefit
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
offset to repay a debt
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
i will get that information over to you
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
the last thing i would request
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you would send along also a copy of
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
your powerpoint presentation that you
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
presented to us so i can get it to the
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of good helpful numbers
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
that we can share with our constituents
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
i want to keep within the noon time here
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
finished with my questions any other
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
questions here in the llb
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none any online and last final
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much um mr
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner we appreciate it uh
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
we uh we all think you're doing a very
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
good job
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that you're you're you're
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
very polite you said 97 was 97.6 some
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
people would
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
some people would round that up to 98.
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
so appreciate your
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your candor um and um
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the fact that you are trying
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
the best you can to get additional
 
01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.790 align:start position:0%
the best you can to get additional
employees

01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
or law firms in to the department to
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
help with these um
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
overpayments one of the only other
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
things um
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
something i would ask you to to work on
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i understand you're doing the best
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
one of the complaints i had is that
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes very difficult to get through
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the telephone
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
and talk to someone that knows what
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
or at least i take that back that was
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
incorrectly stated getting to the right
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
person for their issue
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
um is it easier and
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
more efficient for you folks if they
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
email versus call in
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the call-in is still the best way the
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
way that the hotline currently works
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
is we have it's a tiered structure i'll
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
be i'll be brief with this mr chairman
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
um we have a vendor on tier one that all
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
the calls go into or the
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
or the line share of the calls go into
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
um they've been
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh skilled and trained on how to handle
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
most uh basic unemployment related
 
01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.830 align:start position:0%
most uh basic unemployment related
questions

01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh we give them weekly sometimes daily
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
training on current hot topics and what
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
we see for
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh topics for that are causing a spike
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
in calls if they cannot handle it they
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
then transfer it immediately to tier two
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
tier two or department employees these
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
are all of our staff
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the local offices that are spending
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
their days
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
on the phone answering questions so
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have about ten thousand calls a
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
week right now that we're receiving
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
um four to five thousand of those end up
 
01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
um four to five thousand of those end up
getting

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
transferred in and handled by our local
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
office staff
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
so um that's the best route for getting
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
a question with regard to your
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility answered
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
now what i've found because a few people
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
have my email address
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
um it tends to get plastered all over
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
social media
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
um i can't keep my voicemail
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
down to a number that i you can leave a
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
message um
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
when uh those people that they complain
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
to me about the hotline it's not that
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
they haven't been able to get an answer
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
they don't like the answer that they've
 
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.430 align:start position:0%
they don't like the answer that they've
gotten

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes i'll be the first to
 
01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:31.990 align:start position:0%
and so sometimes i'll be the first to
admit

01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
admit
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
the vendor staff that we have who have
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
been quickly trained up
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes their the answer they provide
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
could have been better
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the person is rightfully um agitated
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
chichester and i
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
would like to introduce senate bill 137
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the minimum hourly rate for
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
tipped employees
 
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
thanks sorry alyssa from a standpoint of
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
representatives is representative
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
timothy horgan representative you're
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay i'm uh i was i'm surprised that i'm
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
speaking but i'm opposed to senate bill
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
137 for the simple reason that it uh
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
lowers the min the wage for tips
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
employees who are often um
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
we found out how valuable they are
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic which is still going
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
on but uh
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're underpaid
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
they're overworked they're
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
underappreciated and this just
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
pays some uh pays them less and then
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
also the whole uh you know because the
 
02:36:17.429 --> 02:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
327 an hour
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
basically um senator bradley is not here
 
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
to explain why he did it but
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is about 45
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
of uh current 725 and certainly
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
i assume this is going to assume this is
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
in anticipation
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the possibility that the federal
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage which is also our statement
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the wage will be uh
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
will be will be increased um so that's
 
02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
will be will be increased um so that's
uh

02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
and also like probably think a lot of
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
the other things in rsa2789 21
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
need to be changed but this bill just
 
02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
affects that one thing so i think that's
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
not a good change if you're going to
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
change it at all the
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh base rate should be higher in fact it
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
probably should just be
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum wage and then the
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
tips are on top of that so i think that
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
with the tips um i think basically the
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
way it works the base ways is what the
 
02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:09.590 align:start position:0%
way it works the base ways is what the
uh

02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
what the owner of the restaurant or the
 
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
other facility
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
pays you to be there even if there's no
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
customers there and then um
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
the tips are on top of that are for
 
02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:19.190 align:start position:0%
the tips are on top of that are for
providing

02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
the service for the employees and it's
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a strange way
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
to compensate people but that's what
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
evolved and um
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
some ways i'm glad to do it because at
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
least i can uh
 
02:37:31.270 --> 02:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
i can make sure they're paid leaves a
 
02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more than the uh
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the absolute minimum so that's uh i mean
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
i do understand the uh
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
tourist industry is a key industry in
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
our country
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
in our especially in our country in our
 
02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
state but actually
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh they're having trouble finding
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
employees one of it may be because the
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
pay rates are are too low given the uh
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
what the labor market is like because
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're having so i
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
i say this bill uh still
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
been it out in the past and um it should
 
02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
be it'll begin so that's uh
 
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's basically all i have to say about
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
it i'd probably probably much more
 
02:38:09.110 --> 02:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
go on more about the technical details
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
than i can but if you want to ask me a
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
question i'll know
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
you can do so thank you representative
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none of any questions for the
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see any thank you representative
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
oregon well thank you thank you
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
there you go sorry about that mr
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and i apologize for being late
 
02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
pleased to be here in support of uh
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 137 which the senate passed
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
um this is a very simple bill and it's
 
02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
also a very important bill um
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
especially with the discussion in
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
washington about raising the minimum
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
wage to 15
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
an hour while it hasn't happened yet
 
02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
certainly it could and there are a lot
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
of people pushing for it
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
what that would mean given our
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
tying of the minimum wage in new
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire to the federal minimum wage
 
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
would um be nearly or actually more than
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
a doubling
 
02:39:31.150 --> 02:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
of the current tipped wage to i believe
 
02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:32.309 align:start position:0%
of the current tipped wage to i believe
6.75

02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
6.75
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
cents an hour by virtue of the fact that
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
we are tied at 45 to the minimum wage
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
i think we all are very very aware
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the duress and the ongoing pressure
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
that um our hospitality industry and
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
particularly restaurants are under
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
and are going to continue to be under
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
many of them have barely survived if
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
they've survived at all the pandemic
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
and the potential of more than doubling
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
the tipped
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
wage is something that could put
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
many restaurants under the
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
just continued duress and and cause them
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
to fold
 
02:40:23.349 --> 02:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of support in the senate
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
amongst the hospitality industry for
 
02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:26.389 align:start position:0%
amongst the hospitality industry for
this

02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
i think you will hear that discussion
 
02:40:29.279 --> 02:40:30.309 align:start position:0%
i think you will hear that discussion
today

02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
from many of the same folks that we
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
heard the discussion
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the one um thing that i would add mr
 
02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:38.309 align:start position:0%
the one um thing that i would add mr
chairman

02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
is the contingency section on line 19
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
and 20 of the bill
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
that um this only takes effect
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
if the minimum wage is raised federally
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
so if nothing changes
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
nothing changes in new hampshire the
 
02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
only other thing that i would add mr
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
chairman is
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that the vast majority
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
of a
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
tipped employee's salary comes from
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
tips not the minimum wage and so by
 
02:41:09.910 --> 02:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
raising the cost
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
as this would do if the federal minimum
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
wage went up in new hampshire's law
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
employers in the hospitality industry to
 
02:41:22.319 --> 02:41:23.110 align:start position:0%
employers in the hospitality industry to
move

02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
move
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
to more tablets replacing people
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
and downshift or reduce hours
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of shifts it would
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
probably lead to
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
job loss and there would not be
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
a corresponding gain for an awful lot of
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
people that could
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
well find themselves out of work if this
 
02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:46.630 align:start position:0%
well find themselves out of work if this
happens

02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
happens
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage as i've always
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
said is well intended but it has
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
that consequence of job loss we want to
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
our hard-working restaurant owners
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
are able to survive this pandemic and
 
02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
are able to survive this pandemic and
survive

02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
survive
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
a doubling of the minimum wage without
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
the tipped wage in new hampshire going
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
up so
 
02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
i support the bill obviously and happy
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley questions in
 
02:42:20.950 --> 02:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
the lob robertson vatican
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
senator bradley i would
 
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
beg your patience as i have a couple
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
questions to go for you
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at line nine
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh in bill tipton
 
02:42:39.030 --> 02:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
line eight tonight tiff's employees were
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
licensed as secondary game operators
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 2017
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
um uh would receive a base rate from the
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
employer not less than 7.5 an hour
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
um could you define
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
um what a secondary game operator
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that rsa
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
is and why uh the senate felt an
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate intimate a special part of
 
02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:05.429 align:start position:0%
appropriate intimate a special part of
that

02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
in this legislation so we
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
made that addition to the legislation
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
the secondary game operators coming to
 
02:43:18.319 --> 02:43:19.110 align:start position:0%
the secondary game operators coming to
us

02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
and saying they had tipped employees
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
that would be subject to the
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
minimum wage increase so we added that
 
02:43:27.359 --> 02:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
minimum wage increase so we added that
in

02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
per their request since they are also
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
tipped wages we did the same with cigar
 
02:43:34.399 --> 02:43:35.269 align:start position:0%
tipped wages we did the same with cigar
bars

02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
bars
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.469 --> 02:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand including them
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like based on the
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
language they would be making
 
02:43:53.429 --> 02:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
more um securely
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh without the compensation tips than
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
they would
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh were they restaurant workers is that
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that somebody representing
 
02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
the secondary game operators and the
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
cigar bars will testify
 
02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and i guess i'd ask you to ask them
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
follow up um you mentioned
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
in your testimony of the potential
 
02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:22.150 align:start position:0%
in your testimony of the potential
downsides

02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
downsides
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
to increasing uh the minimum wage
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
would have on restaurant employment
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
however a study from the economic policy
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
institute suggested that
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
the seven states that don't have a
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
separate tip to minimum wage
 
02:44:38.550 --> 02:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
are all currently experiencing higher
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant growth rates
 
02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
and have the same higher rates of
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
tipping as the states with a sub-minimum
 
02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
tipping as the states with a sub-minimum
wage

02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
do you feel that's accurate or no so i
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
um the senate heard testimony and you
 
02:44:56.309 --> 02:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
certainly can pull up the hearing report
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i suspect you'll hear testimony
 
02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:59.190 align:start position:0%
and i suspect you'll hear testimony
today

02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
from restaurant owners i mean that's um
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know the most accurate summation i
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
think of
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
what they're feeling and what they're
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
facing if the minimum wage increases
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
and so the senate uh wanting to protect
 
02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
and so the senate uh wanting to protect
them

02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
and protect those jobs and to try to
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
keep them viable
 
02:45:21.750 --> 02:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we passed this bill
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up thank you mr chairman
 
02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up thank you mr chairman
um

02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
again looking at the bill uh reading
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
from line
 
02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
15 if an employee shows the satisfaction
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner that the actual amount of
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
wages received at the end of the day
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
period did not equal the minimum wage
 
02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
for all hours work
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
the employer shall pay the employee the
 
02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
difference to guarantee the applicable
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
02:45:46.710 --> 02:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
given that new hampshire doesn't have
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
its own minimum wage
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause the constitution
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
defers that we follow to
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
the 725 minimum wage
 
02:45:59.590 --> 02:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
it is an employer not just making up the
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
the tips and fifteen dollars an hour
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the base minimum
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
wage is set at because it just feels it
 
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
just feels like it's the same
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money and the employee would
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
be making that closer to 15
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
an hour anyways and this just feels like
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:46:21.910 --> 02:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
hat on a hats kind of reach after that
 
02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:22.230 align:start position:0%
hat on a hats kind of reach after that
well

02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
first of all representative lines 15
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
through 18
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
are existing statutes so um
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
understood

02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
i guess that's it okay
 
02:46:49.030 --> 02:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
followed by turcotte
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um senator bradley
 
02:47:00.389 --> 02:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for coming today just have
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
a couple questions
 
02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh just for my own edification uh in
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:47:08.550 --> 02:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned um that
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
if the minimum wage which we follow is
 
02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:12.309 align:start position:0%
if the minimum wage which we follow is
federal

02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
um where it were to go up and double
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
that you know uh
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
potential job loss uh potential uh
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
businesses would be under a hardship
 
02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
hard to maintain costs
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
might even put them out of business my
 
02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:29.750 align:start position:0%
might even put them out of business my
question

02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:33.190 align:start position:0%
question
is

02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
that would occur to all businesses
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill singling out a
 
02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:40.309 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill singling out a
certain

02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
subgroup of people to uh protect
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
well the reason for that representative
 
02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
our statute in new hampshire ties
 
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage for tipped employees to
 
02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:56.630 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage for tipped employees to
45

02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
45
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the applicable minimum wage so
 
02:48:04.710 --> 02:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
federal tipped minimum wage
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
is actually below our 327
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
mark now if the federal if congress
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
also raises the minimum tipped wage
 
02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:20.630 align:start position:0%
also raises the minimum tipped wage
federally

02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
federally
 
02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
then obviously that would supersede new
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
but if it leaves it alone the fact that
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
our 45 percent
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
of whatever the federal minimum wage
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
would more than double it so that's why
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh the carve out obviously you know
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a debate
 
02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
for many years in new hampshire about
 
02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.110 align:start position:0%
for many years in new hampshire about
raising

02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
raising
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage and as i think i
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
indicated before
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
it is well intended some people benefit
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
but then especially entry-level workers
 
02:48:54.399 --> 02:48:55.030 align:start position:0%
but then especially entry-level workers
first-time

02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
first-time
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
job seekers um who
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
need that first job may get priced out
 
02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
need that first job may get priced out
of

02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
that first job with an increase in the
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
but that's a different debate
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's a debate about the overall
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
minimum wage this
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
is just about tipped employees
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
remembering the vast majority of a
 
02:49:18.399 --> 02:49:19.429 align:start position:0%
remembering the vast majority of a
tipped

02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
tipped
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
um employee's salary should be from tips
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
not you know the stipend that they're
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
paid and
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the cost of
 
02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant tours
 
02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
by doubling that is going to lead to
 
02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:34.630 align:start position:0%
by doubling that is going to lead to
price

02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
increases perhaps less tips less jobs
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
and an overall problem i think for the
 
02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
and an overall problem i think for the
restaurant

02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
industry in new hampshire and that's why
 
02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know this is a narrow bill not a
 
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
broad bill on the minimum wage it's
 
02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:54.710 align:start position:0%
broad bill on the minimum wage it's
specific

02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire has that 45
 
02:49:57.439 --> 02:49:58.630 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire has that 45
percent

02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
um you know tying to the federal minimum
 
02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
um you know tying to the federal minimum
wage

02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
wage
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative followed by
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
bradley uh one question
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
on uh beginning on line 11 and going to
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
14 there's a
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph that starts with if such an
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
employee shows the satisfaction
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
on and on and on uh further down in line
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
14 through 18 there seems to be almost
 
02:50:26.399 --> 02:50:27.750 align:start position:0%
14 through 18 there seems to be almost
duplicative

02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh wording can you explain
 
02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
is there a difference there honestly
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
i've read through that about 10 times
 
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to figure out
 
02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
why that both those uh paragraphs are
 
02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:47.910 align:start position:0%
why that both those uh paragraphs are
there

02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i know that in the senate
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
test uh hearing um
 
02:51:03.190 --> 02:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
there was testimony from the department
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
of labor sorry to deflect that question
 
02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
but um it might be better to
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
would you repeat that i i don't follow
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you start on line 11 mr chairman
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
if such an employer shows to the
 
02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:25.030 align:start position:0%
if such an employer shows to the
satisfaction

02:51:25.030 --> 02:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
satisfaction
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
and that continues in bold through line
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
four it does look to be the exact same
 
02:51:29.359 --> 02:51:30.550 align:start position:0%
four it does look to be the exact same
language

02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's a very very very slight
 
02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
difference but
 
02:51:37.349 --> 02:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
to me the intent is the same so i'm
 
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if there was
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
actually an intent or if it's a drafting
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
error or just
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't look right to me going
 
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
further mr chairman on line
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
14 at the very end it starts again
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
if an employee shows to the satisfaction
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
on and on and on
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
and again other than i don't even
 
02:51:58.830 --> 02:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
remember one or two
 
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
minimum one or two word differences it's
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
the exact same
 
02:52:06.550 --> 02:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
intent i believe but i must have the
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
wrong i'm looking at
 
02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh amendment to senate bill 137
 
02:52:14.230 --> 02:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendment 2021-0983s
 
02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
amendment 2021-0983s
correct

02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay i want to make sure we're actually
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think what we should be looking at is
 
02:52:22.319 --> 02:52:24.910 align:start position:0%
i think what we should be looking at is
the

02:52:24.910 --> 02:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear what you said
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay and i think perhaps i'm guessing
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
that when the amendment was incorporated
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
as amended it was done in property
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
as written it doesn't appear correct so
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right we will thank you mr chairman
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh jeb again i think uh the questioner
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be a drafting error but
 
02:53:12.479 --> 02:53:13.429 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be a drafting error but
um

02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.950 --> 02:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
trust thank you yes trust
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative seawork thank you mr
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
um this may be another one of you that's
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
worth deferring uh to someone later
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
my question is also on line
 
02:53:41.269 --> 02:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
11 but the first part of that line
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
where and in some of the testimony we
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
what the different minimum wages would
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
be for tipped employees
 
02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
this seems to introduce a new one
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
at 7 25 an hour that is neither
 
02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
45 of the new one nor
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
is it the old one and it
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
again it seems strange to me for the
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
particular class of
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
secondary game operators to introduce a
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that doesn't match any of
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
the others
 
02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
so from the standpoint of the senate
 
02:54:19.279 --> 02:54:20.389 align:start position:0%
so from the standpoint of the senate
amendment

02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
is there an intent there that we should
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
be aware of or is that something i
 
02:54:26.790 --> 02:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
should bring up with
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh you'd probably be best advised to
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
bring that up with the
 
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
representatives of the tipped employees
 
02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:34.550 align:start position:0%
representatives of the tipped employees
for

02:54:34.550 --> 02:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
secondary game operators because this
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
was the language that they
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
asked us to insert and it may be
 
02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the existing rsas
 
02:54:50.950 --> 02:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right that's all the questions here
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the lob the questions online
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative bouchard you're
 
02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
uh representative bouchard you're
recognized

02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh senator have have you seen
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
the studies that are out there that show
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
that when you increase
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
wages that you increase the productivity
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
of the employees
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
and you lower the turnover rate which is
 
02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:33.269 align:start position:0%
and you lower the turnover rate which is
a

02:55:33.269 --> 02:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
very big cost to an awful lot of
 
02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants to be able to train
 
02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:41.110 align:start position:0%
restaurants to be able to train
employees

02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so i'm
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure that if the
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh restaurant owners thought it was in
 
02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
their best interest
 
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
financially they would
 
02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
raise that tipped wage themselves
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
that being said certainly the testimony
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
in the senate revolved around you know
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
the financial duress that would put many
 
02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners
 
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
under given the vagaries and the
 
02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
pressures that they faced um through the
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the fact that
 
02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
even as you know people are starting to
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated and go back to
 
02:56:22.469 --> 02:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
restaurants now
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's still a diminished diminished
 
02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.070 align:start position:0%
it's still a diminished diminished
capacity

02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
um you know in their business it may
 
02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
um you know in their business it may
change

02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
but i think they feel the duress and
 
02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
they've been under that duress for a
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
long time and so
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
um i think the senate took that
 
02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
um i think the senate took that
testimony

02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
seriously given the pressure that
 
02:56:46.230 --> 02:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:53.429 --> 02:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um any other on our
 
02:56:53.439 --> 02:56:54.070 align:start position:0%
thank you um any other on our
representative

02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
cahill thank you mr chairman
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you senator bradley uh i
 
02:57:01.030 --> 02:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
know you're you've
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
expressed a concern that if the wage the
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
federal wage goes to 15
 
02:57:09.910 --> 02:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:12.309 --> 02:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
it may be unlikely it may only go to 11
 
02:57:14.710 --> 02:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
or 12. do you have a contingency for
 
02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
or 12. do you have a contingency for
that

02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
would would it not be more in line more
 
02:57:18.950 --> 02:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable to have
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
if it went to 12 it would be like and
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
forty cents an hour
 
02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
and again this is only paid it's only
 
02:57:26.710 --> 02:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
making up the difference when the tips
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
were so
 
02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
which we're told the tips are twenty
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour it's only when the tips
 
02:57:32.150 --> 02:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
aren't twenty dollars an hour
 
02:57:33.670 --> 02:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
but the employer has to make up the
 
02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
difference would
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
would that be reasonable to havoc uh
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe i know that there was a bill to
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
lower the percentage uh
 
02:57:43.349 --> 02:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know in the event maybe it could be
 
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
scaled down a bit
 
02:57:49.990 --> 02:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
um there's you know in my
 
02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
view i mean obviously it would have less
 
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
of an impact
 
02:57:57.910 --> 02:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
on a restaurant owner but
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
just reading the tea leaves
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
i think the pressure is on
 
02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
to raise the minimum wage to at least 15
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
02:58:11.990 --> 02:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
and there's as much pressure to raise it
 
02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
higher than 15
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
an hour in washington as there is to be
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 7
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
25 and 15. so what happens who knows
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
regardless tipped employees
 
02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know while this you could argue
 
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
would benefit them
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
even if the minimum wage say went to 12
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
not 15 and their
 
02:58:38.150 --> 02:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
um percentage went to about six dollars
 
02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
675 it still would be a big cost on
 
02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:43.590 align:start position:0%
675 it still would be a big cost on
restaurants

02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
and i think what you'd see is the
 
02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
corresponding move
 
02:58:50.150 --> 02:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
to you know reduce shifts reduce
 
02:58:53.349 --> 02:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
hours and use technology whenever
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
possible to replace
 
02:58:57.910 --> 02:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
um wait staff and and you know we've
 
02:58:57.920 --> 02:58:58.550 align:start position:0%
um wait staff and and you know we've
certainly

02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:59:01.429 --> 02:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
seen that in areas of the country that
 
02:59:01.439 --> 02:59:02.790 align:start position:0%
seen that in areas of the country that
have

02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
raised the minimum wage significantly
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
some people have been helped
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
no question about it if you're somebody
 
02:59:09.840 --> 02:59:10.550 align:start position:0%
no question about it if you're somebody
that

02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know has a job and your wage has
 
02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of the change in law more
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
power to you but if you're somebody who
 
02:59:22.870 --> 02:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
has lost their job because they've been
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
priced out of the market or you're a
 
02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:26.230 align:start position:0%
priced out of the market or you're a
first-time

02:59:26.230 --> 02:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
first-time
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
job seeker that is suddenly priced out
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the market
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're losers too and i think um
 
02:59:35.429 --> 02:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's always been my concern with
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage
 
02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
i mean as as i think we all know right
 
02:59:39.439 --> 02:59:40.830 align:start position:0%
i mean as as i think we all know right
now

02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
um there are thousands of jobs
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
um available in new hampshire and so
 
02:59:48.230 --> 02:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
anybody that wants to work
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
can work but restaurants are under
 
02:59:54.309 --> 02:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
undue pressure because of the pandemic
 
02:59:54.319 --> 02:59:54.950 align:start position:0%
undue pressure because of the pandemic
that

02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be with us i think for quite
 
02:59:58.230 --> 02:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
some time
 
03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
and the potential of this burden on
 
03:00:01.359 --> 03:00:02.389 align:start position:0%
and the potential of this burden on
restaurants

03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
03:00:05.349 --> 03:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
i think when you hear their testimony i
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
hope you feel compelled as we were
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the senate knowing that you know
 
03:00:15.510 --> 03:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
lines 19 and 20 the contingency language
 
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
nothing changes in new hampshire unless
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you senator so this is willing
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
from time
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh i was reading the senate testimony
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
are we the only state in new england
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
that has
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
a tipped wage that has a percentage of
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
the the minimum
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm not certain of that but i believe
 
03:00:42.550 --> 03:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
that to be the case
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative alligent you
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
have another question for the senator
 
03:00:47.910 --> 03:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator for taking the
 
03:00:50.309 --> 03:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
question um as was pointed out
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
correctly by representative richard
 
03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
correctly by representative richard
there

03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh regarding turnover and uh
 
03:00:58.630 --> 03:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
savings from that in the restaurant
 
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
industry in fact one that i
 
03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
want to stop ask a question please
 
03:01:05.429 --> 03:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have a lot of latitude on
 
03:01:06.870 --> 03:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
this representative over the last couple
 
03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:07.910 align:start position:0%
this representative over the last couple
weeks

03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
please ask a question instead of making
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
making your point
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
of what you want to get in there and
 
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
then asking the question off that please
 
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that there are
 
03:01:19.830 --> 03:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
robust studies employment
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
in restaurants regarding minimum wage
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
increases then they suggest that wage
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
increases get absorbed by finer
 
03:01:28.309 --> 03:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
price increases that do not impact point
 
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.670 --> 03:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
this was specifically brought up uh by
 
03:01:34.389 --> 03:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
of the house that the use of
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
would you believes are not appropriate
 
03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:40.469 align:start position:0%
would you believes are not appropriate
in

03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
hearings the purpose of hearings are to
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
receive testimony
 
03:01:47.990 --> 03:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and ask questions of that testimony
 
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
but what do you believe is making a
 
03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
comment made in the statement to the
 
03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.110 align:start position:0%
comment made in the statement to the
individual

03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the individual wants to get out
 
03:01:56.230 --> 03:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
there this is
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
this the the line that uh representative
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
adjutant has taken is not
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this senate understood
 
03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that it was what was presented
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
by the clerk
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
please ask your question but definitely
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
please okay i was not aware of that
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i'll take that into consideration um
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
i want you to ask your question
 
03:02:18.230 --> 03:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative i just want you to do it
 
03:02:20.309 --> 03:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
in a way that's
 
03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
acceptable thank you senator bradley
 
03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
that there might be a difference
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
between what is most beneficial
 
03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of a restaurant
 
03:02:37.359 --> 03:02:38.870 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of a restaurant
worker

03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
worker
 
03:02:42.830 --> 03:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
versus the interest of the restaurant
 
03:02:42.840 --> 03:02:44.550 align:start position:0%
versus the interest of the restaurant
owner

03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
owner
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
well i think as i've tried to answer
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
this question
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage creates winners and
 
03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage creates winners and
losers

03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
losers
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
and if your wage goes up you're clearly
 
03:02:57.429 --> 03:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
a winner
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
but if you've lost your job due to
 
03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:01.590 align:start position:0%
but if you've lost your job due to
technology

03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
or less hours or fewer shifts
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
because the cost to the restaurant owner
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
that creates losers
 
03:03:13.110 --> 03:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
too and so i've always been very
 
03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:14.469 align:start position:0%
too and so i've always been very
concerned

03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
that raising the minimum wage and while
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
this is a subset of it
 
03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
does create winners and losers and in
 
03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:22.710 align:start position:0%
does create winners and losers and in
particular

03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
and restaurants are really good at
 
03:03:25.359 --> 03:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
and restaurants are really good at
hiring

03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
first time job seekers
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
i mean that that is a staple for many
 
03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:34.870 align:start position:0%
i mean that that is a staple for many
restaurants

03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
and they are often at tipped wages
 
03:03:42.150 --> 03:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
and if they're unable to hire as many
 
03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:42.950 align:start position:0%
and if they're unable to hire as many
people

03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
then people lose too and that's my
 
03:03:45.279 --> 03:03:49.269 align:start position:0%
then people lose too and that's my
concern

03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you one more question
 
03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you one more question
representative

03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman uh senator this
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
is just
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
state and federal it's my understanding
 
03:04:07.750 --> 03:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire defers basically to
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
minimum wage as we don't have a statute
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
defining the federal
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
bill there are there is a number
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
proposed as opposed to a percentage
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
which effectively would freeze that
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
my question is is how does that play out
 
03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
can the state of new hampshire supersede
 
03:04:34.319 --> 03:04:35.190 align:start position:0%
can the state of new hampshire supersede
federal

03:04:35.190 --> 03:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
well i think i answered that if the feds
 
03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
raised the tipped minimum wage then
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
this debate is over but in the past
 
03:04:54.870 --> 03:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding representative is
 
03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
congress has raised the minimum wage
 
03:04:59.590 --> 03:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
without raising the tipped wage
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill only applies to that
 
03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance where
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
congress were to raise the minimum wage
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
and leave the tipped wage unadjusted but
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
because of the 45 percent provision
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire law then our minimum
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
wage in that eventuality
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
would more than double if the feds raise
 
03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
the tip minimum wage
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
see no other hands senator bradley thank
 
03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:39.920 align:start position:0%

03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%

no worries uh next up is representative

03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh merrimack district six
 
03:05:56.230 --> 03:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
i do not see him let me know uh by a
 
03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
text if he comes back on please
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
um the next step is henry value uh new
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire lodging and restaurant
 
03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:08.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire lodging and restaurant
association

03:06:08.070 --> 03:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh mr value
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman uh and members
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:06:22.389 --> 03:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is henry value
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm here on behalf of the lodging
 
03:06:28.389 --> 03:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
and restaurant association uh
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
we asked uh senator bradley uh to bring
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
this bill in
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
um and it is it's pretty straightforward
 
03:06:35.920 --> 03:06:37.349 align:start position:0%
um and it is it's pretty straightforward
um

03:06:37.349 --> 03:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
as you can see it uh the big change is
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
how to figure out the employee tip wage
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
from a 45 percent of what the applicable
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is
 
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
and instead replacing it with an
 
03:06:56.150 --> 03:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
absolute number
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
of 327. mr chairman you asked
 
03:07:04.710 --> 03:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire and
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
whether other states have a percentage
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
as we do here in new hampshire uh
 
03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
calling it 45 percent of the applicable
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
minimum wage we are the only state in
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
the country
 
03:07:17.510 --> 03:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at all the other states they
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
have an absolute
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
number in statute um so by moving from
 
03:07:22.560 --> 03:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
number in statute um so by moving from
this

03:07:23.349 --> 03:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
sliding percentage uh
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
to an absolute number will be more in
 
03:07:29.910 --> 03:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
line uh with
 
03:07:34.150 --> 03:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country 45
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the applicable minimum wage today is
 
03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
of the applicable minimum wage today is
327

03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
327
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
so we are proposing to keep it
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
there um you know it's interesting that
 
03:07:45.439 --> 03:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
there um you know it's interesting that
uh

03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
the tipped employees are in the minimum
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
wage statute
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
um because while the minimum from the
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
employer is 327
 
03:08:00.309 --> 03:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
their total wages on average are between
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
20 and 22 dollars an hour so they're
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
actually the highest
 
03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
paid in a restaurant
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you were to go into the back of the
 
03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
house the restaurant
 
03:08:14.630 --> 03:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
and talk with the dishwasher who's maybe
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
making 12
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
an hour and ask whether they'd prefer to
 
03:08:18.880 --> 03:08:19.510 align:start position:0%
an hour and ask whether they'd prefer to
make

03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:08:23.670 --> 03:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
the 327 and then chips on top
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
i think the answer you'd get is they
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
prefer to be a tipped employee in the
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
front of the house
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
because again those are the highest paid
 
03:08:33.670 --> 03:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
employees and they deserve it because
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
they do a great job
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
but when we talk about tipped employees
 
03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
they are not minimum wage employees
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
and um so uh
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
again we are looking to uh freeze it
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill as represented as senator
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
bradley mentioned this
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
only will go into effect if
 
03:08:57.429 --> 03:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum is increased in i
 
03:08:57.439 --> 03:08:57.750 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum is increased in i
think

03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
um you know it's an agenda item of uh
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
this administration in this congress so
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think we expect it to go up
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and but this bill only
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
addresses the tipped employees um
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
there was an effort there was actually a
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill that passed if you google
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh minimum wage tip wage
 
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
main state of maine uh you'll find
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh stories from several years ago where
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
they did away with the tip wage
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh they basically uh
 
03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
required restaurants to pay the tipped
 
03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
required restaurants to pay the tipped
employees

03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum and you'll find in those
 
03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
the minimum and you'll find in those
stories

03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
stories
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
that it was the tipped employees the
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
following year
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
that convinced the legislature to go
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
back to the way it was
 
03:09:50.389 --> 03:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
because they were all worried about
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
again they make the majority of their
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
wages by tips if
 
03:10:01.590 --> 03:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
if it's 20 to 22 an hour that the
 
03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
if it's 20 to 22 an hour that the
average

03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
average
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
taking home obviously it's seven you
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
know to 19
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
17 to 19 dollars that they're making
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
from tips
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
an hour and that is that's that's the
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
bulk of their pay
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
and those are wages uh if you look at
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
279 26 b
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
which addresses tip pooling and sharing
 
03:10:26.229 --> 03:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh the first part of that statute says
 
03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
tips are wages uh and shall be the
 
03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
property of employee
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
so the and and um employers must pay
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh the social security taxes on those
 
03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
uh the social security taxes on those
tips

03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
tips
 
03:10:41.429 --> 03:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
so the employees must report them to the
 
03:10:41.439 --> 03:10:42.309 align:start position:0%
so the employees must report them to the
irs

03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
irs
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
as wages um so while we're
 
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the minimum wage statute
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
um this
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
issue in this bill is not really about
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
minimum wage workers
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
and i'd just like to answer a few other
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
questions i know representative turcotte
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
brought up a
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
very good question um and i would agree
 
03:11:03.510 --> 03:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
was just a drafting area because if you
 
03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:11:09.670 --> 03:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill is amended by
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
03:11:14.070 --> 03:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
that is not in bold that's the current
 
03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:15.830 align:start position:0%
that is not in bold that's the current
statute

03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
when they added in the language in bold
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think the drafter
 
03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
in legislative services must have wanted
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the tipped employees that are
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
secondary game operators
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh were also going to be making
 
03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
the difference between the 327
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the minimum hourly rate so that that
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
sentence that's addressed twice probably
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be there that
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
probably something to check the
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
legislative services on
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
the question that represents seaworth
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
had about
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
um the 725 dollars per hour i'll let the
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
secondary game operators
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question but i believe that
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
they have that in there as 725 right now
 
03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
because that's what secondary game
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
operated tipped employees are paid right
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
now as the minimum
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not uh considered tipped
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
employees right now so they're paid the
 
03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:17.269 align:start position:0%
employees right now so they're paid the
seven

03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
they have to be paid the minimum of 7.25
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i think the goal uh certainly the
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
goal with the restaurant folks is not to
 
03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:27.030 align:start position:0%
goal with the restaurant folks is not to
decrease

03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage from the employer so
 
03:12:32.389 --> 03:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we're proposing 327
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i think in the secondary game
 
03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:35.429 align:start position:0%
and i think in the secondary game
operators

03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
operators
 
03:12:38.950 --> 03:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
instance their currently minimum is 7.25
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
those folks are looking to keep it and
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
not reduce that so
 
03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
this basically would keep the status quo
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh no one's wages would go down uh
 
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
tipped employees actually
 
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
see their wages go up every year uh
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
menu prices increase on average about
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
five percent a year
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
and tipped employees are paid
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh as a percentage of the full price of
 
03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
the menu so if you tip
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
20 um every year
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
that that meal price goes up five
 
03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
that that meal price goes up five
percent

03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
um and so the employees wages uh go up
 
03:13:19.830 --> 03:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
so there's already
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh this uh mechanism
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
in which uh tipped employees wages go up
 
03:13:25.359 --> 03:13:26.070 align:start position:0%
in which uh tipped employees wages go up
annually

03:13:26.070 --> 03:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
annually
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
anyways um so with that
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
um i guess uh oh representative huff
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
asked a good question about
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
the tip wage and the federal wage
 
03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
for tipped employees is two dollars and
 
03:13:45.040 --> 03:13:45.670 align:start position:0%
for tipped employees is two dollars and
thirteen

03:13:45.670 --> 03:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
thirteen
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
cents our new hampshire minimum of 327
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
is higher than the federal but as
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
senator bradley mentioned
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
if in congress uh this year they
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
increase the tip wage
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh above 327 then we would have to
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
um you know comply with the federal law
 
03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:07.429 align:start position:0%
um you know comply with the federal law
so

03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:09.990 --> 03:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're cogniti you know cognizant of that
 
03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:10.550 align:start position:0%
we're cogniti you know cognizant of that
but

03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
there is the same discussion going on uh
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
in dc about
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
the tipped employees and tip wages uh
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
and our
 
03:14:20.469 --> 03:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh two senators uh shaheen and hassan
 
03:14:21.910 --> 03:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
are very much involved in that
 
03:14:21.920 --> 03:14:22.950 align:start position:0%
are very much involved in that
discussion

03:14:22.950 --> 03:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:14:25.349 --> 03:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
i think they recognize the uniqueness of
 
03:14:26.550 --> 03:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
the industry
 
03:14:30.469 --> 03:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
um and i guess with that i'd end
 
03:14:33.269 --> 03:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
my testimony and be happy to answer any
 
03:14:33.279 --> 03:14:34.389 align:start position:0%
my testimony and be happy to answer any
questions

03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
mr v this is willing from time one of
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
the questions that representative
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
edition asks had to do with
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
um the payment of the wages if someone
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
does not make 7.25 an hour
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's a slow cold rainy day and no one
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and if this bill passes they would
 
03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:51.429 align:start position:0%
um and if this bill passes they would
make

03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
327 an hour the employer would have to
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
find out what they need for that period
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
of time
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
and pay them 725 an hour or the
 
03:15:03.269 --> 03:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
difference between what they earned and
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
the 7.25 an hour
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay them the
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
difference to make sure that they made
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
the 725 but i
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
i would ask the department of labor if
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
they've ever
 
03:15:15.750 --> 03:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
come across that circumstance i don't
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
know of any restaurant in which
 
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know a because they staff
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant staff
 
03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
to what they know their um
 
03:15:29.349 --> 03:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
their activities going to be um after a
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
while you get to know that thursday
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
night's a busy night i'm going to need
 
03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
night's a busy night i'm going to need
more

03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
tipton i'm gonna need more weight staff
 
03:15:37.030 --> 03:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know a monday night
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
is slow i probably need a third of the
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
wait staff
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh so it's i'm not aware of instances
 
03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
uh so it's i'm not aware of instances
where

03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh a restaurant has had to make up the
 
03:15:49.910 --> 03:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
difference because a tipped employee
 
03:15:53.349 --> 03:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
has not made at least 7.25 you can ask
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
the department of labor uh that if
 
03:15:55.830 --> 03:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're on
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
they may be aware of it but um but that
 
03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
language is in the statute
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that no one makes less
 
03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
than the minimum wage
 
03:16:07.030 --> 03:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
but as i as i mentioned before tipped
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
employees are not minimum wage employees
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
the highest uh paid uh employees
 
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
no just up so um federal minimum
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
wage for tipped employees is two dollars
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
and seventeen
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
cents we are proposing three dollars and
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
twenty seven cents
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
we are proposing three twenty seven
 
03:16:29.590 --> 03:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
because effectively
 
03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it is today because 45
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
of the federal 725
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
is 327. so we are proposing
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
to keep the tip wage for tipped
 
03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:44.950 align:start position:0%
to keep the tip wage for tipped
employees

03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
at the same amount that it is today
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
if the federal government decides
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill and they decide
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's 10
 
03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is ten dollars an hour
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
they will they also come up do they
 
03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
normally come up with a tipped wage
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
also and that we would have to adhere to
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
they very well could change the way so
 
03:17:12.389 --> 03:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
right as i said
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the federal minimum on the
 
03:17:15.990 --> 03:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
tipped uh
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
wages uh i thought it was 213. you
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned 217.
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
see the 23270 whatever it is um
 
03:17:26.550 --> 03:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
if they don't do anything on that then
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's 327 would be the floor
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
that uh a business would play pay the
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
tipped employee
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
if on the other hand uh the feds
 
03:17:40.309 --> 03:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to increasing the minimum
 
03:17:41.990 --> 03:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
wage to 10
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
12 15 whatever it is they also
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
increase the tip wage from 213
 
03:17:51.910 --> 03:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
to a higher number uh and if it's higher
 
03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
than 327 then new hampshire restaurants
 
03:17:55.520 --> 03:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
than 327 then new hampshire restaurants
would

03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay the higher federal minimum
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
wage this 327
 
03:18:05.190 --> 03:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
would be trumped by the higher federal
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
minimum as representative bradley
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
as senator bradley said he said you know
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
this this
 
03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
this what we're doing here with this
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill could be trumped by what happens in
 
03:18:14.479 --> 03:18:15.349 align:start position:0%
bill could be trumped by what happens in
dc

03:18:15.349 --> 03:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
dc
 
03:18:19.030 --> 03:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
if in fact they changed the tip wage
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
which is currently 2 13.
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh i i asked christine by
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
a text or
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
to come up to some of the chart there
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
are seven states
 
03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the country that um have a
 
03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:34.710 align:start position:0%
uh in the country that um have a
percentage

03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
of their tip wager percentage thank you
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh there might there are some more
 
03:18:39.349 --> 03:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions for you mr babe wherever
 
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
somebody did
 
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank mr chairman and thank you mr
 
03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
pendleton for taking the question
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
um what is the source of the data that
 
03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
um what is the source of the data that
suggests

03:18:48.630 --> 03:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
03:18:51.510 --> 03:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the average wage for tipped workers
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
in hampshire is over 10
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
hours i believe we've gotten it from
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
employment security they keep a lot of
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
rudy ogden from the department of labor
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
so maybe we'll ask him that question
 
03:19:11.190 --> 03:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah do you have any additional
 
03:19:14.229 --> 03:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
questions well i just it's
 
03:19:16.630 --> 03:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
a question i have data from the bureau
 
03:19:21.670 --> 03:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and and i'm talking new hampshire i
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
mean uh
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
as well cooking um
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
any questions here representative
 
03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:19:44.469 --> 03:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr uh villa
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh um i'm not sure if you'll be able to
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
answer this but
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
it's just occurring to me what would be
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
the purpose
 
03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire having a higher tipped
 
03:20:03.670 --> 03:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage than the federal
 
03:20:06.630 --> 03:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
when we don't do that with the
 
03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:07.510 align:start position:0%
when we don't do that with the
non-tipped

03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
non-tipped
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
wage um
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for hourly employees and we
 
03:20:19.279 --> 03:20:19.830 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for hourly employees and we
have

03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
the tip wage i think it was what 2012 or
 
03:20:25.510 --> 03:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
something when
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
our hourly minimum wage
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
um that was repealed and
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
we then fell to the federal statute
 
03:20:38.550 --> 03:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i guess there was uh
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
a recognition then uh
 
03:20:45.190 --> 03:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
that if we also repealed
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
the tip wage at that time
 
03:20:50.790 --> 03:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
then it would have gone down to the 213.
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
we've always been higher than the
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
federal 213
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
and so uh i don't think anybody wanted
 
03:20:58.319 --> 03:20:58.870 align:start position:0%
and so uh i don't think anybody wanted
to

03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
reduce uh anyone's wages
 
03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's why um because when
 
03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
they repealed
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
the hourly uh new hampshire's hourly was
 
03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:11.429 align:start position:0%
the hourly uh new hampshire's hourly was
725

03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
725
 
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the federal was 7.25 so repealing
 
03:21:15.429 --> 03:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
for all intensive purposes really did
 
03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
nothing because we still had to comply
 
03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
with the federal 725.
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
if you repealed the 45
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the applicable minimum at that time
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
you would have done away with our 327
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
have gone down to 213 which is what no
 
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
one wanted to do
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
so i believe that is to answer your
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
question that's
 
03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
why uh we have a higher
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
um tip wage because
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
historically we've always had a higher
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
tip wage than the federal one
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
um so what i'm gathering is
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
is the reason that this and correct me
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
03:22:03.670 --> 03:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
not picking this right um
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
the reason that this bill is coming in
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
is to protect
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
the businesses from paying in theory a
 
03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
higher minimum wage
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
so why would they be against lowering
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
if we were to just go strictly with just
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
the interest in the industry in this
 
03:22:24.800 --> 03:22:25.349 align:start position:0%
the interest in the industry in this
bill

03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:22:29.190 --> 03:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
is to prevent the minimum tip wage from
 
03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
is to prevent the minimum tip wage from
going

03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
up um when the federal
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh minimum increases uh
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
because as as you see the statute it
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
says 45 percent of the applicable
 
03:22:41.910 --> 03:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
minimum wage so
 
03:22:45.269 --> 03:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
if the federal minimum wage increased to
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
15 or 12 dollars
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
the tip wage in new hampshire would
 
03:22:50.479 --> 03:22:51.750 align:start position:0%
the tip wage in new hampshire would
increase

03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:22:55.349 --> 03:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
to 45 of whatever that federal minimum
 
03:22:55.359 --> 03:22:55.830 align:start position:0%
to 45 of whatever that federal minimum
is

03:22:55.830 --> 03:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
03:23:01.110 --> 03:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
we have no interest in reducing anyone's
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
wages we essentially just want to
 
03:23:07.750 --> 03:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
keep the status quo on the minimum from
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
the employer but again
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
tipped employees wages go up annually
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
because menu prices go up
 
03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
five percent on average every year and
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
they're paid as a percentage of the
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
price of the meal so
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you welcome
 
03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
veyu good to uh hear you again i can't
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
see you from here but uh
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
um so we we tip 20
 
03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
generally on the price of the meal
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
so this leaves us with a situation where
 
03:23:51.120 --> 03:23:51.510 align:start position:0%
so this leaves us with a situation where
a

03:23:51.510 --> 03:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
server carrying you know a tray full of
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
pancakes and eggs anyway you like them
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
and coffee
 
03:24:01.349 --> 03:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
is making quite a bit less than the
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
person in the high-end restaurant
 
03:24:07.510 --> 03:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
doing very similar work have any comment
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh certainly high-end uh
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
server servers working in high-end
 
03:24:16.319 --> 03:24:17.349 align:start position:0%
server servers working in high-end
restaurants

03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
are making more wages than
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
those uh at the very low
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
um you know there's the mid-range
 
03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
um you know there's the mid-range
restaurants

03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
03:24:30.309 --> 03:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's the and there's the lower uh
 
03:24:33.190 --> 03:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh range ones and uh certainly there is
 
03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:33.670 align:start position:0%
uh range ones and uh certainly there is
that

03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh you probably don't have
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks that have been serving um
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
in those lower ends that stay there very
 
03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
long unless they're
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
of course in a part of the state where
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is no high end
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh someone that learns the uh
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know at a lower end uh i'll tell you
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants are looking to hire people
 
03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:01.349 align:start position:0%
restaurants are looking to hire people
um

03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
so if you're not happy with the wages
 
03:25:05.429 --> 03:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
you're making some place
 
03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
and you want to go make higher wages
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of employers that will
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
hire you uh
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
both at high end mid-range uh so there
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
are there are options out there
 
03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
currently i mean
 
03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
this labor shortage isn't just for the
 
03:25:21.190 --> 03:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry i think you hear it
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
statewide health care child care i mean
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
there just are not enough workers out
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
there so there currently are plenty of
 
03:25:29.359 --> 03:25:30.070 align:start position:0%
there so there currently are plenty of
options

03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
options
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
um so if you're a tipped employee at a
 
03:25:33.279 --> 03:25:33.990 align:start position:0%
um so if you're a tipped employee at a
restaurant

03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're not satisfied with the wages
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're getting there are
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
a number of options out there uh to move
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh well again
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're in a you're in a nice restaurant
 
03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
you're in a you're in a nice restaurant
and

03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's they expect it to be busy but it's
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
not something else is going on
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
around town and and they send us they
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
might send the staff home and you
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
what happens in that case you get that
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
327 an hour
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
and how do you pay your bills so
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh if it's a slow night you get sent
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
home there is a two hour
 
03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
minimum that you have to pay so the
 
03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
minimum that you have to pay so the
employer

03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:26:18.309 --> 03:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
you show up and 30 minutes in it's like
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
all right we're not going to have you
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
know what's up
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
you go home the employer has to pay the
 
03:26:22.800 --> 03:26:23.590 align:start position:0%
you go home the employer has to pay the
um

03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
at least two hours uh of uh
 
03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
the minimum which is going to be the um
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you didn't make any tips then the
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
employer will have to pay
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
7.25 an hour because they got to make
 
03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:36.309 align:start position:0%
7.25 an hour because they got to make
sure

03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
that you walk out of there with at least
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
7.25 an hour
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
so if you didn't get any tips you're not
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
just going to get 327 you're going to
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
get 7.25 so
 
03:26:48.389 --> 03:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
there's two hours you make 15 dollars
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
if you get no tips at all
 
03:26:57.670 --> 03:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:00.550 --> 03:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i know this i know this is
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
part of the federal law but i i wonder
 
03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
part of the federal law but i i wonder
that

03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:05.190 --> 03:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
what you think about this requirement
 
03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the minimum rather minimum
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirement you make thirty dollars
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
if you're usually and customarily make
 
03:27:14.309 --> 03:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars a month um
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's the threshold for being a
 
03:27:17.910 --> 03:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
tipped employee
 
03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that's out of a date mr
 
03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
do you think that's out of a date mr
value

03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
value
 
03:27:24.309 --> 03:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh it was set a long time ago um
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
could it be higher i suppose um it would
 
03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:28.389 align:start position:0%
could it be higher i suppose um it would
require

03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know where where to set it i don't
 
03:27:33.030 --> 03:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
know it probably requires some work
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
which would basically you probably have
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill
 
03:27:40.550 --> 03:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh and work on it which
 
03:27:43.269 --> 03:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
i would not uh suggest you do that uh i
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
think this this bill is needed sooner
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
than later
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to work with you uh at
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
where that i mean you're correct it's
 
03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
been 30 dollars in stats for a long time
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
um could it be higher yeah um
 
03:27:59.590 --> 03:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
what should it be i don't know uh but be
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
thanks very much thank you are there any
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
for representation for mr value
 
03:28:13.349 --> 03:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a moment here before i
 
03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
call the next um
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
speaker i've always liked to keep things
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
casual in the labor committee
 
03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
um always allow people to ask the kind
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
of questions they'd like to
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't like the the riff that's
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
going on right now
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
we probably shouldn't ask the person how
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
to just
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
is someone who's representing the
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
lodging restaurant association
 
03:28:48.710 --> 03:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're asking them a question of how is
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
someone supposed to pay their bills on
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
that amount i understand what you're
 
03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:51.990 align:start position:0%
that amount i understand what you're
trying

03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
trying
 
03:28:55.190 --> 03:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
to say i understand that sometimes these
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
issues become uh emotional
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
but we want to keep it to the
 
03:29:01.830 --> 03:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate questions
 
03:29:07.590 --> 03:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
for for our speakers that are asking um
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i think everybody knows what i mean
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get into any
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
any any details i i the whole question
 
03:29:16.950 --> 03:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
about would you believe has always been
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a joke
 
03:29:20.469 --> 03:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
that we all use when someone asks a
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
question that really isn't a question
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's making a statement
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
and then we all say would you believe
 
03:29:26.790 --> 03:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
and kind of laugh and chuckle at it we
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
try to move on to the next business
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
um that came from and
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
it was a was a parliamentary
 
03:29:34.800 --> 03:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
it was a was a parliamentary
parliamentary

03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
presentation put on by could i speak
 
03:29:39.359 --> 03:29:40.229 align:start position:0%
presentation put on by could i speak
yeah

03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
well no i swear that comes from this sir
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
this chair is that is used on the house
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
floor during debates and it's
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate there but it is not
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the experience again i
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
i want to give everyone a lot of
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
latitude and ask the questions they want
 
03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i just don't want to cause a riff
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
when you someone asks a question
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's clearly meant to
 
03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
make a point and then try to get someone
 
03:30:09.920 --> 03:30:11.429 align:start position:0%
make a point and then try to get someone
to

03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:13.110 --> 03:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
embarrass someone to ask answer your
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
question that's all we're trying to do
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the goal of the executive session all of
 
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
us is to learn from our our speakers
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
so um but i wanted to get back to
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
to kind of the way we were um
 
03:30:27.429 --> 03:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
since i brought up two people's name
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
this is very odd
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna keep going for a couple
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
minutes before we get back because
 
03:30:32.710 --> 03:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative attitude representative
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
cahill since i did mention some things
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
there i'm going to let you guys just
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
respond okay
 
03:30:38.229 --> 03:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then we'll get back to our hearing
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you for giving me a little bit
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
of attitude here
 
03:30:41.990 --> 03:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative madison thank you mr
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and i want to clarify
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
like the point of the would you believe
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
question is not to embarrass
 
03:30:52.229 --> 03:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
lawmakers like other representatives or
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it is when folks come
 
03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
before this committee
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
and they say
 
03:31:04.870 --> 03:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
things like oh oh increasing the minimum
 
03:31:04.880 --> 03:31:05.429 align:start position:0%
things like oh oh increasing the minimum
wage

03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
will increase technology in the
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
workplace and it will lose jobs and all
 
03:31:09.680 --> 03:31:10.630 align:start position:0%
workplace and it will lose jobs and all
this

03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i have an example of a study from
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
the economic policy institute or cornell
 
03:31:20.790 --> 03:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
um that disagrees with that
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
it would be great in the moment to
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
have sort of present them with that
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
information and give them an opportunity
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
to rebut that
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
if you know uh they disagree with it or
 
03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up information it's the same
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing that representative kuchar did
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
where he referenced you know the exact
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
same study that i was referencing
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
from cornell uh just without the name
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
so you know i i don't like to do the
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
gotcha stuff i ask a lot of rhetorical
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions to occasionally make a point
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
but also
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
draw that distinction and give an
 
03:31:56.710 --> 03:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for clarification
 
03:32:02.469 --> 03:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the charitable gaming folks um
 
03:32:12.309 --> 03:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't like a gotcha it was why are we
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
making an exception for that
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the answer the best we got was
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
because they asked
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with someone saying i have
 
03:32:20.630 --> 03:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
another study that says x
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
y and z um and could you tell me what
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
your study is so i can compare the two
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
um i just don't want to monologue it so
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to put it into a question
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
understood representative thank you mr
 
03:32:36.229 --> 03:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
chair um yeah
 
03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
mr they and i have known each other for
 
03:32:39.429 --> 03:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
a couple of years now and
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
my the question i asked was really no no
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
disrespect to him
 
03:32:45.510 --> 03:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
or the restaurant industry it was merely
 
03:32:46.710 --> 03:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
they they were told that the restaurant
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
the tipped workers
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
make so much the average is this but
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
there are times when they don't
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
and that's really what i was trying to
 
03:32:58.150 --> 03:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
get across no uh
 
03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
no embarrassment or disrespect intended
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
all right excellent
 
03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to deviate for
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
a second i always want to keep things
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
copacetic here even when we disagree
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much oh
 
03:33:14.309 --> 03:33:14.319 align:start position:0%

03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
operators association and i am here in
 
03:33:36.080 --> 03:33:37.349 align:start position:0%
operators association and i am here in
support

03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
of this legislation and i will be brief
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
but i can
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
jump into answering a couple of
 
03:33:45.190 --> 03:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
questions that have been asked regarding
 
03:33:48.070 --> 03:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
secondary game operators first i well
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
secondary secondary game operator
 
03:33:52.800 --> 03:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
secondary secondary game operator
licensees

03:33:53.910 --> 03:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
in the charity gaming business are
 
03:33:57.670 --> 03:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
essentially dealers
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
so these are the people that would be
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
dealing cards at a blackjack table or a
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
poker table or
 
03:34:05.429 --> 03:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
operating a roulette wheel or a crap
 
03:34:05.439 --> 03:34:06.550 align:start position:0%
operating a roulette wheel or a crap
table

03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
those are the positions that come under
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
that title secondary game operator
 
03:34:15.349 --> 03:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
and currently they are subject to the
 
03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage of seven and a
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
quarter however
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
they are a relatively new uh job
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh charity gaming as it exists today
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
under 287 287d was created in this state
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
in 2006.
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
prior to that those jobs did not exist
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
because charity gaming did not exist
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
as we have it today so
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
from the beginning these workers have
 
03:34:44.070 --> 03:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
made most of their money from tips and
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i believe they're legitimately
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
tipped employees and that's why we
 
03:34:49.349 --> 03:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to take
 
03:34:51.269 --> 03:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to be included to have
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
them included
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
as tipped employees as to why
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
have their rate at seven and a quarter
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh weight uh rate uh for weight staff um
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
same as mr value said we had no
 
03:35:06.630 --> 03:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
intention of looking to lower
 
03:35:09.190 --> 03:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
someone's existing minimum wage and
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
since those folks
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
are making seven and a quarter uh we
 
03:35:12.239 --> 03:35:13.429 align:start position:0%
are making seven and a quarter uh we
said

03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
let's establish it uh that that rate for
 
03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
let's establish it uh that that rate for
them

03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
um i will tell you that um it now every
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
room of course is different there are 16
 
03:35:24.150 --> 03:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
charity gaming facilities in new
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire they are small ones ranging
 
03:35:29.110 --> 03:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
from a very small location up in berlin
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh to a very busy uh locations on the
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know in salem new hampshire in
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
manchester nashua
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so the rate does vary but the
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
low end on uh tipped employees or
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
dealers in those
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
rooms range between 12 13
 
03:35:49.990 --> 03:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
an hour in tips up to 35 40
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
an hour uh in some of the other rooms so

03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
toss over a chip or something to the
 
03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:33.670 align:start position:0%
toss over a chip or something to the
dealer

03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
dealer
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
that is how they are tipped correct
 
03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
03:36:38.469 --> 03:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
typically that is exactly what happens
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
particularly in poker if someone wins
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
the pot
 
03:36:43.990 --> 03:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
they throw a tip chip to the dealer so
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
you're proposing to
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
reduce them from 725
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
yeah come tipped employees uh no sir if
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
you look at the legislation
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh it would establish 725 as the minimum
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
wage for secondary game operators they
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
would stay at the seven and a quarter
 
03:37:11.110 --> 03:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
my apologies for uh any other questions
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you mr
 
03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr newman for your
 
03:37:18.880 --> 03:37:20.070 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr newman for your
testimony

03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
um that helps me a lot with my question
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
i was wondering um if
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
you were able to shed any light on the
 
03:37:29.920 --> 03:37:30.710 align:start position:0%
you were able to shed any light on the
question

03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte asked earlier
 
03:37:32.720 --> 03:37:33.750 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte asked earlier
about

03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
the next four lines where with a slight
 
03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
the next four lines where with a slight
variation

03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
variation
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
it it repeats what's already there but
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
applies it to the secondary game
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
operators do you know
 
03:37:49.030 --> 03:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
why that language was chosen
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative i read that and it looks
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
to me like
 
03:37:55.349 --> 03:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
the bull language is referring to
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh the federal minimum wage and the
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
language that's not in bold as current
 
03:38:00.080 --> 03:38:00.950 align:start position:0%
language that's not in bold as current
statute

03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:38:03.190 --> 03:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
which refers to the quote applicable
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm assuming that that's the reason
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's written like that but
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's something you may
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
want to check with legislative services
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
because the federal minimum wage if it
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't change
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't come into play but the
 
03:38:19.110 --> 03:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
applicable minimum wage in the current
 
03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:20.070 align:start position:0%
applicable minimum wage in the current
statute

03:38:20.070 --> 03:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh language would still apply that's
 
03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:26.150 align:start position:0%
uh language would still apply that's
true

03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
true
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
other questions from members online
 
03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative to me followed by
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative tooney you're recognized
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr newman uh is there any
 
03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
place like the labor department to be
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
able to find out
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the the uh gaming employees make
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of tips i i know that there
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
might be numbers
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
in in terms of that in in the case of
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
waiters and waitresses in
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
in restaurants is there any place we can
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
find out what the actual
 
03:39:05.269 --> 03:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
average uh tipped wage that your your
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
people get
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can say representative
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
is just like a restaurant
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
um these businesses would file the
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
necessary uh
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
tax paperwork for instance on regarding
 
03:39:17.199 --> 03:39:17.670 align:start position:0%
tax paperwork for instance on regarding
paying

03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
paying
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax and so i would assume
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
the department of employment security
 
03:39:21.760 --> 03:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
the department of employment security
would

03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
have information on those numbers okay
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you mr
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason that they have to
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
be called tech
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
workers just because they receive tips
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
or can they just
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
receive their normal 725 or whatever
 
03:39:45.030 --> 03:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
and accept their tips uh outside being
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
called a tipped worker
 
03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
well from our perspective it's you know
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
differences among tipped employees how
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're treated
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the statute and these folks are
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
legitimately tipped employees they
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
certainly make
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
more than 30 a month in tips they rely
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
on their tips to make a living
 
03:40:08.550 --> 03:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
just as you know waitresses waiters do
 
03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're certainly in the same category
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe that
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
had the job existed 50 years ago they
 
03:40:15.189 --> 03:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
probably would have been included
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the category of tipped employees when
 
03:40:19.750 --> 03:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
it was created but as i said
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
because the job is relatively new it
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
only was created
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
in 2006 um it just uh you know it's not
 
03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
there in the statute now
 
03:40:32.229 --> 03:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you just follow up quickly
 
03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
it just seems odd that that we'd like to
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
put somebody new into tipped wages
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
when this is a questionable um part in
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
our law a lot of people would like to
 
03:40:44.309 --> 03:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
see tipped wages just disappear
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
that people should be treated as
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
employees period
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
and no special um government
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
intervention as to how much
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
they can be paid is it now i understand
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
that you see them as tipped
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
employees but is there any reason that
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
you want to put them into this statue
 
03:41:01.760 --> 03:41:02.630 align:start position:0%
you want to put them into this statue
besides

03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
besides
 
03:41:05.670 --> 03:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
just that you see this as tipped
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
wages one specific reason would be that
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
unlike every other well i won't say
 
03:41:12.640 --> 03:41:13.189 align:start position:0%
unlike every other well i won't say
every

03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
not certain but certainly unlike
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
virtually all
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
other employees or businesses you
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature have a great deal to do
 
03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
the legislature have a great deal to do
with

03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
the ability of a charity gaming facility
 
03:41:25.439 --> 03:41:25.990 align:start position:0%
the ability of a charity gaming facility
to

03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
have revenue for instance you cap the
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
bet limits at currently at ten dollars
 
03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:31.110 align:start position:0%
bet limits at currently at ten dollars
and

03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's a statutory requirement
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
that charities get 35 percent of the
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
money and the state gets 10
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so we can't real we can't simply
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
raise our wages
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
are or raise our prices the way another
 
03:41:45.510 --> 03:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
business can so if the feds were to come
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
in with a 15 or 20 dollar
 
03:41:49.189 --> 03:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that would have a
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous impact
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
on the owners of these businesses who
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
would have no ability to offset that
 
03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
wage increase um
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
and despite the fact that their
 
03:42:01.349 --> 03:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
employees were making you know pretty
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
good tips but
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh they would not be able to just say
 
03:42:06.150 --> 03:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
well we're going to allow 20 bets now
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's subject to the legislature
 
03:42:08.160 --> 03:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
that's that's subject to the legislature
so

03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate your
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
answer thank you
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative representative thank you
 
03:42:17.349 --> 03:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
following up on what you just said uh
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
i i'm not an expert in charitable gaming
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
i was not aware of the
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
max cap donations
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
but if the language in here
 
03:42:35.189 --> 03:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
is um employees should update the
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
difference to guarantee the federal
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
statutory that are not really great
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
so they're still paying for an increase
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the minimum wage anyways
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
is not the appropriate there is not a
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
better solution
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
to that issue to be to revise the
 
03:42:51.429 --> 03:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
language and statute that you just
 
03:42:52.710 --> 03:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
versus inserting language in here that
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
would then be overridden
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
i i have to tell you representative i
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
apologize but i really don't
 
03:43:09.189 --> 03:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
understand your question go ahead i
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
i i i know where you're getting with
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
just try it again
 
03:43:15.269 --> 03:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
but my point is like if you're talking
 
03:43:15.279 --> 03:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
but my point is like if you're talking
about

03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
the if if you're talking about the
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions placed on
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
institutions that operate charitable
 
03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:25.590 align:start position:0%
institutions that operate charitable
gaming

03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we have to insert this language
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the bill to make it
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
better for those people would not
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
a better solution be to just amend
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
those restrictions and possibly allow
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming folks to make a
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more money
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
versus inserting language in the bill
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
that would then just be overwritten by
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal legislation anyways were it to
 
03:43:57.600 --> 03:43:58.469 align:start position:0%
federal legislation anyways were it to
happen

03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
i i get you i understand your your point
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and i would say to you that uh
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't um we would certainly support
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
increasing the
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
the debt limits at the charitable gaming
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
locations but that's not the bill in
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we we just feel assuming that that's
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to remain in
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
in place as it is today that that this
 
03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:18.389 align:start position:0%
in place as it is today that that this
bill

03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.510 --> 03:44:31.520 align:start position:0%

question i have
 
03:45:06.960 --> 03:45:10.150 align:start position:0%
question i have
to

03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:11.990 --> 03:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
i will ask you a question because i'm
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
sorry to say that i received a text
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
message from
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative from rudy ogden he has
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
had to go to another meeting he will not
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
be able to address us he did
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
give me something to read but uh i just
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to know that so go ahead
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
oh um the um
 
03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the gaming industry i
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if he can answer this
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
question or not but
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
um if your dealers are paid minimum wage
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
um how
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
how or why why or how
 
03:45:39.750 --> 03:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
do they get to claim their tips over and
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
above the minimum wage and is there an
 
03:45:46.150 --> 03:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
claim their tips they would do it
 
03:45:51.510 --> 03:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
just the way any other tipped employee
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
does i mean a dealer
 
03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
reports their tips uh in most cases
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
because the dealers do
 
03:46:00.150 --> 03:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
receive their tips directly they report
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
their tips to the employer the employer
 
03:46:01.920 --> 03:46:02.469 align:start position:0%
their tips to the employer the employer
is

03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
mr value said you know then is subject
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
to pay in the fica tax and
 
03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax on those tipped wages
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
just like they would any other wages so
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's how the
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.150 --> 03:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up mr chairman all
 
03:46:20.160 --> 03:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up mr chairman all
right

03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
um with uh lowering going to a tip wage
 
03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
which um
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
would allow you the employer to withhold
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
those wages through their paycheck
 
03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then pay the applicable taxes
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
because that's how the irs looks at
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
shipped employees is if it's below the
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
03:46:44.309 --> 03:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh as 327 you would at least have to
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
make it to minimum wage
 
03:46:49.990 --> 03:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
do you does your employer employees now
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability to
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
claim their tips even though they paid
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
that 7.25 an hour
 
03:46:56.550 --> 03:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's the original question that just
 
03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
acts differently
 
03:47:01.030 --> 03:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes they uh so the employer currently uh
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
again that's the minimum of
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
some dealers make more than 725 but yes
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
would withhold taxes from 725 and they
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
would also
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
withhold in most cases the 725 would
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
allow them enough
 
03:47:18.150 --> 03:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
so that if an employee let's say it's
 
03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
reported x dollars in tips
 
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
the employer calculates the tax due
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
on that x and also withholds that from
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
the paycheck of the employee and it's
 
03:47:30.150 --> 03:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
paid to the appropriate
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:37.269 --> 03:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman thank
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%

did representative tooney have a
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%

i'm testifying on behalf of a number
 
03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
of voices of faith in new hampshire in
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to senate bill 137
 
03:49:59.349 --> 03:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
and i strongly urge this committee to
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
find this particular bill
 
03:50:03.670 --> 03:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate you've already
 
03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:04.469 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate you've already
heard

03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill was um submitted
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
in reaction to the fear among some
 
03:50:12.870 --> 03:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
that the federal minimum wage would be
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
increased and um the number that's been
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
bandied about
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
for months now and discussing this is 15
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
an hour and many people including
 
03:50:23.590 --> 03:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislators have talked about this is
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
that somehow
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
the wage would go up to fifteen dollars
 
03:50:27.990 --> 03:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
an hour tomorrow or next week and this
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
was imminent and it was going to happen
 
03:50:29.520 --> 03:50:30.550 align:start position:0%
was imminent and it was going to happen
immediately

03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the reality is if this is a reaction
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
to the federal
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh raise the wage act which is the
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
current um
 
03:50:40.950 --> 03:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill which is now before the um the u.s
 
03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:41.910 align:start position:0%
bill which is now before the um the u.s
senate

03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
it talks about a gradual increase in the
 
03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't hit 15 an hour until 2025
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
so this this myth that all of a sudden
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant um owners and and
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
employers of tipped workers are going to
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
see 15 that has the potential to see 15
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
an hour tomorrow is simply a myth and
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
you should
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
not be passing legislation based on
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
based on a myth which is
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
which is not um based in reality at all
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
so please don't be misled but the other
 
03:51:13.120 --> 03:51:13.510 align:start position:0%
so please don't be misled but the other
thing

03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
is that um again if this was introduced
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
in reaction to that 15
 
03:51:20.469 --> 03:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
without it it seems like it was it was
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
introduced without anyone doing any
 
03:51:24.150 --> 03:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
research about what is actually
 
03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:25.590 align:start position:0%
research about what is actually
potentially

03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
possibly happening at the federal level
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
which certainly doesn't seem to be
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
happening anytime soon
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
that is the federal raise the wage act
 
03:51:33.439 --> 03:51:34.710 align:start position:0%
that is the federal raise the wage act
addresses

03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
both on the gradual increase
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the federal minimum wage and a
 
03:51:40.560 --> 03:51:41.349 align:start position:0%
in the federal minimum wage and a
gradual

03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
gradual
 
03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
increase in tipped wages and the reality
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
i think again if you do the legislative
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
research you will know
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
that that only two things will happen
 
03:51:52.150 --> 03:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of federal legislation
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
which will then have an impact on new
 
03:51:53.439 --> 03:51:53.990 align:start position:0%
which will then have an impact on new
hampshire

03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
the first is that there will be that the
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
raise the wage act which is currently
 
03:51:58.479 --> 03:51:59.269 align:start position:0%
raise the wage act which is currently
written

03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
which um talks about an increase uh the
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
same gradual
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
increase on in the tipped wage as the
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh minimum wage for non-tipped workers
 
03:52:09.120 --> 03:52:09.750 align:start position:0%
uh minimum wage for non-tipped workers
that's

03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:52:11.670 --> 03:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
in one package in the bill right now
 
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
that nobody seems to be recognizing
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that it's
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
possible that that
 
03:52:20.309 --> 03:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
legislation will be introduced that does
 
03:52:21.269 --> 03:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
away with a tipped
 
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
wage and then goes to the concept of one
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
fair wage for all workers
 
03:52:28.150 --> 03:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
um and then with without any without
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
addressing tips
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think that the possibility of that
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
happening i personally i'd love to see
 
03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
it happen but
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
i think the possibility of that
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
happening is very minimal
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
and the reality is that the folks will
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
be working at
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
looking at some version of the um the
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
raise the wage act
 
03:52:45.750 --> 03:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
which does address tipped wages so the
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
fact that you're trying to do or you're
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
being asked to do a piece of legislation
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
which is it's going to be null and void
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be overridden
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
if this is a in reaction to something
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's happened federally right now
 
03:53:01.030 --> 03:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a 725 on minimum
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
wage and you're dealing with 327 for
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
tipped workers
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that is the way it's going to be
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
until something passes federally
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
and when something passes federally it
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be something that addresses
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
minimum wages and will override this
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislation anyway
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
so this there's no way that the feds are
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
going to carve out a minimum wage
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
without also addressing tipped wages
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
talk to your federal legislators talk to
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
people in the know about what's
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
happening federally
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
and they will tell you that that's the
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
case so passing this
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
bill which is really not going to mean
 
03:53:32.399 --> 03:53:33.269 align:start position:0%
bill which is really not going to mean
anything

03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
is not in the best interest of new
 
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire at all
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
um just the other thing really quickly
 
03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
to say is
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
um the the restaurant sector which is
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
primarily where this is coming from
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
is um there are so many workers in the
 
03:53:49.990 --> 03:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
work in that sector and we depend on
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
them to be good workers
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
um in order to attract people to come to
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
our state this is an important sector of
 
03:53:59.189 --> 03:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
and to say to them that we are going to
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
freeze your wages no matter what the way
 
03:54:07.269 --> 03:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
they are today
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
no matter what no matter what increases
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
there are and the cost of living or
 
03:54:12.150 --> 03:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
what is saying what is that saying to
 
03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
those workers it just seems it strikes
 
03:54:16.239 --> 03:54:17.189 align:start position:0%
those workers it just seems it strikes
me

03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
as a wage freeze put into statute
 
03:54:23.590 --> 03:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
is telling those workers that you are
 
03:54:23.600 --> 03:54:24.229 align:start position:0%
is telling those workers that you are
losing

03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
losing
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
somebody talked i think senator bradley
 
03:54:27.269 --> 03:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
talked about winners and losers
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think putting this in statute would
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
say we consider you to be losers
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that we are not
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
talking about just
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
first time job seekers or or entry level
 
03:54:38.960 --> 03:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
first time job seekers or or entry level
on

03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
people working you go into any
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant and you will see people of
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
all ages
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
people with families etc that are trying
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
to work to to earn a living wage
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
but are doing a job they love um just
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
i want to also say that a very extensive
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
studies have been done
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
over the years using department of labor
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and u.s equal employment opportunity
 
03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
and u.s equal employment opportunity
commission

03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
on statistics and data and i want to
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
read you the subheading of one of the
 
03:55:06.560 --> 03:55:07.429 align:start position:0%
read you the subheading of one of the
studies

03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
studies
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
the subheading is just the data is
 
03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:11.269 align:start position:0%
the subheading is just the data is
overwhelming

03:55:11.269 --> 03:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
overwhelming
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
tipping encourages racism sexism
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
harassment and exploitation so we
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
already know that chipped workers of
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
color are often chip less
 
03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
female workers must often must put up
 
03:55:24.790 --> 03:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
with sexual harassment
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire in order to make a
 
03:55:28.229 --> 03:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
decent wage
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
wage theft is happens in this particular
 
03:55:31.199 --> 03:55:31.830 align:start position:0%
wage theft is happens in this particular
industry

03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:55:33.750 --> 03:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of employers actually
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately paying out the tips
 
03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's an industry problem on top of that
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
this work is
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
hard work so to freeze
 
03:55:45.750 --> 03:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
the wages in statute of this particular
 
03:55:47.189 --> 03:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
sector of employees
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
is just it's so immoral
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
um based on the people that i am um
 
03:55:53.510 --> 03:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
speaking for
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh and the fact that this this
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
legislation itself
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
is just nonsensical in terms of what's
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
happening at the federal level
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
i encourage you just to put this bill
 
03:56:04.150 --> 03:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
aside and uh
 
03:56:06.630 --> 03:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
and to not spend your your valuable time
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with it anymore
 
03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
i also just want to pose a question am i
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the idea is to pull that particular
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
category of
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
um charitable gaming workers into a
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
definition of what a chipped worker
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
is so um and so that their
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
wages their overall wages will be frozen
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
at 7.25 an hour even if the minimum wage
 
03:56:36.309 --> 03:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
goes up so what the federal
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
raise the wage act says that the next um
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
progression i think is going to be 9.50
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
an hour is what that that particular um
 
03:56:46.150 --> 03:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation talks about
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
so what but with this is what this bill
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
doing then
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
saying that those particular workers
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
will not be eligible
 
03:56:55.269 --> 03:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
for the 9.50 an hour if that becomes the
 
03:56:56.790 --> 03:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage because
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
this legislature has frozen their wages
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
at 7.25
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
their base wage so it's just a question
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
i have because i'm not quite
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're being told
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
but in any event you've heard me say
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary legislation and i implore
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
you to just set it aside and vote in
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
any questions for the presenter
 
03:57:26.150 --> 03:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
is it accurate to say that uh the uh
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
act would increase to the tipped minimum
 
03:57:39.600 --> 03:57:40.229 align:start position:0%
act would increase to the tipped minimum
wage

03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:57:43.349 --> 03:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
to 495 in 2021
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct and so that would
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
supersede anything that you would try to
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
put in statute
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%

here on behalf of the cigar association

of new hampshire which is
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
a coalition of 10 locations retail shops
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
sell premium cigars five of which have a
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
cigar bar license
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
similarly to the charitable gaming
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
operators the cigar bar license
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the statute was put in place in 2009
 
03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
many decades after the creation of this
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
statute which listed
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
um as you see on the bill starting on
 
03:59:25.920 --> 03:59:26.309 align:start position:0%
um as you see on the bill starting on
line

03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
five uh the categories of industries
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for the tipped wage
 
03:59:34.150 --> 03:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
we simply ask uh to be included in that
 
03:59:34.160 --> 03:59:34.550 align:start position:0%
we simply ask uh to be included in that
because

03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
their servers are similarly tipped and
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
and make very good wages
 
03:59:41.670 --> 03:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
and make very good tips there and
 
03:59:41.680 --> 03:59:42.389 align:start position:0%
and make very good tips there and
similarly

03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
like the other industries that you heard
 
03:59:45.510 --> 03:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
from this afternoon
 
03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
are very concerned about an increase at
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
the same effects apply here
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier uh and i don't have
 
03:59:56.239 --> 03:59:56.710 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier uh and i don't have
anything

03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:59:59.750 --> 03:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to say other than
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to be included in that um
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
in that statute
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
other than to say and to remind the
 
04:00:06.080 --> 04:00:06.550 align:start position:0%
other than to say and to remind the
committee

04:00:06.550 --> 04:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:00:09.429 --> 04:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
that line 19 of the bill exists this is
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
a contingency
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
it only applies if the federal law is
 
04:00:13.760 --> 04:00:15.349 align:start position:0%
it only applies if the federal law is
passed

04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%

04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
information subsequent to the hearing
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr barry any questions for him
 
04:00:25.600 --> 04:00:27.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr barry any questions for him
in

04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
are there any online
 
04:00:39.670 --> 04:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
i have one question for you mr berry
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
certainly if this bill were to pass
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to ten dollars in the tip
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
weights of five dollars
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
ours would automatically have to
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
go up to that or would we have to
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
don't they does the federal government
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
usually give the states a time period in
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
which they must ratify
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
that or does that happen automatically
 
04:01:06.399 --> 04:01:07.110 align:start position:0%
that or does that happen automatically
uh

04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair to be honest with you i'm not
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
sure which
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
of those two scenarios would apply um
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to work with you to find
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
out the answer
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much are there
 
04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much christina
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands currently up
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none it is 2
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
28 i'm going to close the hearing on
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
04:01:41.910 --> 04:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
137 i apologize i have to say one thing
 
04:01:41.920 --> 04:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
137 i apologize i have to say one thing
i

04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:01:45.910 --> 04:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'm losing it definitely losing it i
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
would like to read something
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to find whether he
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
mr ogden deputy commissioner of the
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
university department of labor
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
we apologize he had to unfortunately
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
leave the one concern we have this is a
 
04:02:18.720 --> 04:02:19.189 align:start position:0%
leave the one concern we have this is a
quote

04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
quote
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
the one concern we have on this
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
is if the fed raises the tipped rate
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
period it will cause confusion and we
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the dol
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
would not be able to directly address
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
those that do not pay the raised amount
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
they would run a foul of the feds but we
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
would not be able to address it
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
um so i'm gonna try to get clarification
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
for what that is based on my last
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
question i just asked
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and i will
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
have um mr ogden email
 
04:02:52.640 --> 04:02:56.370 align:start position:0%
have um mr ogden email
everyone

04:02:56.370 --> 04:02:56.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.380 --> 04:03:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i think at this point
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
you really can't testify we can't all
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know so um
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
in an executive session that could come
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
up but i hope i hope to get some
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
clarification from
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
mr ogden uh in an email to all of us to
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
follow up on his
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
testimony he was not able to get and
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
then you'd all be able to answer
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative sullivan
 
04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
since we can't um go back and forth with
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
mr ogden on an email due to right to
 
04:03:35.279 --> 04:03:36.229 align:start position:0%
mr ogden on an email due to right to
know

04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:03:37.990 --> 04:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate for him to uh
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
come to the executive session too
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a little bit unorthodox to
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh testify but since
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
it seems like he's got concerns and
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're not really clear about them
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
that would be a public meeting and he
 
04:03:50.840 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a public meeting and he
could

04:03:53.800 --> 04:03:53.810 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:03:53.810 --> 04:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
could
[Music]

04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think we can do both if anyone has
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
i will ask him to um anyone can
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
based on what i just said anyone is
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
able to contact him individually to get
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
the question answered
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with having a
 
04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
department head
 
04:04:17.830 --> 04:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
here to speak at the beginning part of
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
an executive session i've done it before
 
04:04:25.040 --> 04:04:25.050 align:start position:0%
and it's proven to be um
 
04:04:25.050 --> 04:04:27.269 align:start position:0%
and it's proven to be um

04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate and positive so i can do
 
04:04:29.199 --> 04:04:31.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate and positive so i can do
that

04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%

on with senator tom

from constituents
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%

um to they didn't have insurance or the
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
means to pay for it um again this was a
 
04:06:35.920 --> 04:06:36.710 align:start position:0%
means to pay for it um again this was a
requirement

department
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and thought that the best way to do this
 
04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
and that's how this amendment came about
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
was to align this under chapter 275
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
which is the protective legislation
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
to read that it should be unlawful
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
for an employer as defined in rsa 275
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
4 to require any employee or applicant
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
for employment to pay the cost of a
 
04:07:07.269 --> 04:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
coveted 19 test
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
as a condition of employment i think
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that this
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
is this is important for the workforce
 
04:07:14.160 --> 04:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
is this is important for the workforce
um

04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i just heard some of the last
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimony about you know a
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
workforce and and and wages
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
and tipped workers and i just want to
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
think about it in
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat of that framework um as well as
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is good for
 
04:07:31.110 --> 04:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
members of the public and our customers
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
to know
 
04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i've often noted right now when i
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
like might pull up to a certain
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant locally for takeout
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a sign that says you know
 
04:07:41.110 --> 04:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
we are a um
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
we are a safe workplace our employees
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
are screened
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
they're tested i mean i think this is a
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence and a workforce
 
04:07:49.520 --> 04:07:50.149 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence and a workforce
issue

04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
or workforce protection at the same time
 
04:07:53.199 --> 04:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
or workforce protection at the same time
so

04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
with that i am happy to take any
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
questions to the
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the best of my ability and if i don't
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
have the answer i'd be happy to get back
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
to you thank you
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there any
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
questions here in the lobby
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
senator sullivan you recognized
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:08:16.830 --> 04:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.840 --> 04:08:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
i did read the original uh version of
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bill um
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's far more complex than um the
 
04:08:24.560 --> 04:08:25.030 align:start position:0%
it's far more complex than um the
current

04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh version he has amended was the
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of amending this
 
04:08:31.830 --> 04:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
just to accomplish the same thing in a
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
much simpler way
 
04:08:35.110 --> 04:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan exactly
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
in fact this was originally part of
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
senate bill 132
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
which was an omnibus covid
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill and we realized that 123 was asking
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
for the same thing
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh but in a more complex way so we
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
amended it out of the other bill came
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
over here and i joined
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
senator sherman so thank you for the
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
question exactly
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.590 --> 04:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
can i get a raise with that well
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
probably not thank you uh
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
senator apprentice for taking my
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
question i also read the original bill
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
we've talked about a co-payment waiver
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh so that the uh person the employee
 
04:09:34.469 --> 04:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to pay
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
it does say the cost review it's it
 
04:09:44.950 --> 04:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
would be the employer that would pay the
 
04:09:44.960 --> 04:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
would be the employer that would pay the
cost

04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
um of this and i would i'd like to
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
point out that in the current statute
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
under 275 and again thank you for your
 
04:09:53.680 --> 04:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
under 275 and again thank you for your
question

04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
um that there is a similar provision um
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so it's 275.3 which makes it
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
unlawful for an employer
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
again as defined in 275 for to require
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
an employer an applicant from employment
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
to pay the cost of a medical examination
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
or the cost of furnishing any records
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
required by the employer as a con
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
condition of employment so it would be a
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
cost to the employer if they are
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
requiring this
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
again for their safe workplace and it is
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
consistent with language
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
and another part of the statute thank
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
senator huff you recognized i'm sorry
 
04:10:33.840 --> 04:10:35.030 align:start position:0%
senator huff you recognized i'm sorry
representative

04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
promotion wow um
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that if an
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
employer is going to ask for a test
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
expecting to find out the results of
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
that test
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i bring that up because it's also my
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that hipaa
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
would prohibit an employer from getting
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
any information medical
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
that the employee didn't want released
 
04:11:07.110 --> 04:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
so if they theoretically are never going
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
to get the answer to the question that
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
they're making them do
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for your
 
04:11:22.229 --> 04:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think hipaa um theoretically i don't
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
think that hipaa crosses this because if
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
you've consented
 
04:11:30.149 --> 04:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
and you are agreeing as a condition of
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
employ you know this is a condition of
 
04:11:31.600 --> 04:11:32.309 align:start position:0%
employ you know this is a condition of
employment

04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
and that information would have to be
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
shared but i can confirm that
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
do i see any other questions for the
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
senator um
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%

senator for taking my question um if an
 
04:12:30.800 --> 04:12:32.149 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um if an
employee

04:12:32.149 --> 04:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
as an employer if an employee has an
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
outside event let's just say for covert
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:37.429 align:start position:0%
outside event let's just say for covert
19.

04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
19.
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
um their family members come home then
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
they're infected or
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
however it is and they have to get
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
tested if an employer asks for the
 
04:12:47.110 --> 04:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
results of that test would they be
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
required to pay for that test
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
technically they couldn't come back to
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
work without it with the executive
 
04:12:57.990 --> 04:12:58.000 align:start position:0%

guidance that we have right now so thank
you

04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative a lot of your questions i
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
think a train went by in the middle of
 
04:13:05.040 --> 04:13:06.229 align:start position:0%
think a train went by in the middle of
that

04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's a train track right near his
 
04:13:10.950 --> 04:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an excellent question i
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
mean if they have had
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
um we could i think we could probably
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
take a step further to clarify this if
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
they went to an outside event that was
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
not work related
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
as people do um and they were
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
potentially exposed
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
and got tested you know it's
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
there um it's there you know you have
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between whether
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
you're acquiring this or not so let's
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
say you're not requiring this
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
but you ask them is the courtesy to
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
share the result but this is making it
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know unlawful for the payment if you
 
04:13:44.080 --> 04:13:45.429 align:start position:0%
you know unlawful for the payment if you
require

04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
them to take the test so if you say you
 
04:13:50.309 --> 04:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
know i'm requiring you to do this
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
um and they haven't already taken it
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
then it would be up to you but
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
i think let me talk to um the assistant
 
04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner over
 
04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
in labor and see what his opinion would
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
be on that
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy um chairman infant i don't
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
know if you want to get
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
if you want me to get back to you or
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
directly to um representative avenatti
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
but i'd be happy to clarify that that's
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
an excellent question
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah senator if you wouldn't mind um uh
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%

04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
i just want to know if the training was
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%

early i was hoping to get on and
 
04:14:36.389 --> 04:14:36.399 align:start position:0%

quickly here
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
i want to get back to thursday as this
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
was done on a specific wednesday i did
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
talk to representative for rudy to make
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
sure he could make it
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
because i know thursday it seems to be
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
the the best day for everyone that we
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
discussed at the beginning
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
of the year i was trying to accommodate
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
the department of labor as well the 19th
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
is a wednesday
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
i my goal would be um
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
or either the 20th or the 27th probably
 
04:17:40.720 --> 04:17:44.389 align:start position:0%
or either the 20th or the 27th probably
um

04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
we do the 27th it's the last you know
 
04:17:47.670 --> 04:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
has to be done that day
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
that if we do that you know we're
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
pushing it just be done by the 29th
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
or the 28th one concern that i would
 
04:17:55.600 --> 04:17:56.070 align:start position:0%
or the 28th one concern that i would
have

04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
um but uh my wife was really sick
 
04:18:13.000 --> 04:18:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:14.469 align:start position:0%

04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be a situation where
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
votes go a different way because people
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
can't make it especially because of
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
getting their shots so
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
