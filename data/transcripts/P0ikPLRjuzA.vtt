morning it being 10 o'clock we're going
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
to start officially the uh presentations
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the capital budget uh leading off
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
today is uh Department of administrative
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
Services welcome to Public Works you're
 
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
up thanks for having us um I'm Charlie
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
Arling house I'm the commissioner of
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services and with me uh
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
Ted cupper is the director of Public
 
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
Works and Karen rcky is the director of
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
plant and property and part of our
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
presentation includes the beginning half
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
of it an overview of how we get here as
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
a state that is to say how the process
 
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
works for some of you who have been on
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
this committee since before I was born
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
maybe J Mike m Mike years ago we did
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
this and one of your colleagues was
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
really impatient with me for explaining
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
things and kept going like this to me
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
but he wasn't reelected
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
so so we're okay um so so I'm going to
 
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
start and actually Karen is going to
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
start and tell you who Das is and begin
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
the way the process works from the P
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
perspective of of an agency submitting
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
requests great
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
so my part of d the division of plant
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
and property um we're about half of the
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
staff um we maintain and operate 96
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
buildings throughout the state including
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
many Office Buildings so the
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
headquarters for many state agencies all
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
the cour houses um we don't maintain or
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
operate any Residential Properties so no
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals no prisons nothing like that
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
um we do maintain our buildings through
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
a combination of In-House staff and
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
contracted Services um it's kind of the
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
way we have to balance things um in
 
00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
order to stay with budget and to try to
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
can great um so now I'll just talk a
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
little bit about um how we evaluate our
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
facilities and decide what ends up in
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
our capital budget request every bium um
 
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
so each
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
year my staff go through each of those
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
96 buildings they do a walkthr they fill
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
out information regarding the status of
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
every building system so the HVAC the
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
lighting uh the building envelope
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
including Windows um the
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
exterior um any Paving parking lots
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
things like that we document all of that
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
and then um we take all of that
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
information for all of the facilities
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
and kind of combine them and then do a
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
prioritization based on that so there
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
might be 30 buildings that need Paving
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
projects but we might select the top
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
five that need to be done for example um
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
this year we were able to do a
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
professional facility condition
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
assessment where we had a consultant
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
come in and evaluate every single one of
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
our um Central facilities buildings so
 
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:06.759 align:start position:0%
that's about half of that 96 um and that
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
was really helpful because they
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
documented the age of all of our systems
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
so when those boilers when those HVAC
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
systems were installed um when the
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
carpeting was last replaced all of those
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
things were documented and then from
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
there they projected out when they think
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
we will need to replace or work on those
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
systems um and that has kind of guided
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
us a little bit better and so we have a
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
few changes in our prioritizations from
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
where we were last year when we
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
submitted our original um capital budget
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
submission um included with our uh
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
prioritized list of capital project
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
requests we do a very rough uh kind of
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
guesstimate of how much we think it will
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
cost and that's very basic like a roof
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
might cost you know5 or $10 a square
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
foot and we multiply that out we just
 
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
say this is what we think the roof is
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to cost um Ted will talk a little
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
bit more about how those numbers get
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
refined later on in the
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
process um and then we complete the
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive capital budget forms that
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
are required uh for each and every
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
project summarizing um over three Bia of
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
where where we think we're going to be
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
um with those Capital requests um and
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
that gets rolled up at the department
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
level and then sent over to the
 
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
governor's office for
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
consideration so that that's kind of a
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
snapshot of what agency does and and
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
what I want to emphasize is every agency
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
kind of does the same thing what Karen
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
does is much more comprehensive because
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
she has a big maintenance staff that
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
does it um an agency making a capital
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
budget request does the same thing
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
though they look at what their needs are
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
that are capital is and then they triage
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
and they decide well I can't ask for
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
everything and I'm going to pick my
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
priorities and and that becomes the
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
giant set of requests that is the
 
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.190 align:start position:0%
giant set of requests that is the
initial

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
basis of the governor's capital budget
 
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:04.839 align:start position:0%
hearing so these forms used to be called
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
form 1A and we're trying to streamline
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
it but it's still sort of form 1A but
 
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
these forms are all put together it is
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
what the agency wants to do not
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily what's a great idea to do um
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
in every detail it's what they they
 
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
think it will roughly cost and some
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
agencies will estimate that really well
 
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
and some won't because they don't have
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
that level of experience they're they're
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
not building stuff all the time so so
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
they don't know and on it projects
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
everybody basically gets the assistance
 
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
of doit to guess to guesstimate those
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
costs so there's a giant binder that's
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
produced for the Governor's capital
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
budget hearings and and some of some of
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
you attend a lot of you look online um
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
but it is basically every agency
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
presents to the governor and and you
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
basically can present anything you want
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
that you've done a form for and we do
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
three days of hearings and everybody
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
gets up Ted is on the panel I'm on the
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
panel Dennis gay from doit is on the
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
panel the governor's budget director
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
chairs the hearing and we're basically
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
talking to him and and it's a big binder
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
of stuff so that that's what that
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
hearing is about and there are
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
representatives of the of the house and
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
the Senate um typically the chairs of
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
Public Works are invited and um and some
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
people come and lately a lot of people
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
watch online so there are fewer people
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the audience than there used to be um
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
so so it's less of a big deal that set
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
of requests is enormous so typically the
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
general fund portion is about 700
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
million let's say and you're going to
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
fund about 120 million and so it it's
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
way too much nobody gets anything that
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
they want they get a little tiny
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
fraction of what they want but it's the
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
start of that process so if you turn to
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
prioritization typically in the past the
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
governor's office has asked uh has asked
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
us dasas and mostly Public Works to go
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
through and basically divide them into a
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
b and c the a are like obvious health
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
safety issues um and C would be
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
like a shower in a bathroom at a state
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
agency that's what we typically always
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
used to put last on the list and you
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
just prioritize that way why we do it
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
because the number of projects that are
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
formally estimated is better if it's
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
smaller because there's more time to go
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
into detail that that real estimate um
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
and so typically the governor's office
 
00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
and so typically the governor's office
will

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
select maybe twice as many by dollar
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
value as they might fund two $300
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
million worth of projects for DPW to
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
estimate now what happens to be that
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
this year um they didn't do that they
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
they eliminated some before the hearing
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
and then basically um the governor's
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
budget director because he might not be
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
returning said just estimate all of them
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
which ends up being
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
more work but and less detail so the
 
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
more work but and less detail so the
estimates

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
are not quite as detailed as they might
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
have been if we had time to do more but
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
Ted's going to talk to you a little bit
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
about when we decide which projects are
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
estimated what Public Works does and how
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
that process works in in getting to in
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
getting to produce this book which we'll
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
talk about in a
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
minute good morning Ted CER the director
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
of uh the division of public works so uh
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
Public Works is a a group of about 22
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
people who all engineers and Architects
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we're tasked with um either building
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
new buildings for the state or
 
00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
maintaining buildings that the state
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
already owns so we have a great deal of
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
expertise in estimating uh capital
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
projects so as uh Charle and Karen uh
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
just explained uh these estimates um
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
come from the governor office and we
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
asked to uh prepare a detailed estimate
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
each one of our project managers or
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
contract administrators as they're
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes called um takes on seven to 10
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
of these
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
estimates and uh and they dive deeply
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
into them uh they pull archive plans uh
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
they meet with the agencies they go
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
visit each and every site uh sometimes
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's photographs involved they
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
take measurements and then they come
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
back to the office and using several
 
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.829 align:start position:0%
back to the office and using several
different

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
resources um determine how much that
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
project costs they also include um
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
overhead and
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
profit um uh consultant fees that might
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
be involved in the cost of the project
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
um our fees which by law were required
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
to um uh to ask for and uh and then we
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
put together these
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
estimates and um and
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately by law the estimates have to
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
be produced by December 1st and that's
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
what this book is here and nobody gets
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
to see this book until the governor
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
makes uh their uh budget presentation
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
sometime in you know
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
mid-February and and this becomes part
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
of the budgets the overall Governor's
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
budget that's good um
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
so at this stage we're well into the
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
process right agencies have started
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
looking at buildings maybe in January or
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
February it's it's almost a year later
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
this book is produced there are a couple
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
things about this book so first of all
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're not limited to so you're not
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
limited to what the governor proposed
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
you're not limited to what agencies want
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
you can have your own ideas you're not
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
technically limited to what's in this
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
book although typically it's unusual
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
when something comes outside of the book
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
2017 the governor proposed funding a
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
project that was not in the CIP book and
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
it was because I was his budget director
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um there was a the we said some the
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
state librarian was the was the acting
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
director Commissioner of cultural
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
resources and he's like I don't want an
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
archaeological thing I want a union
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
catalog and I'm like okay and so we did
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
that we he was very helpful and we gave
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
him something he wanted um but every
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
project has a narrative and and I say
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
that because it it does two things one
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
it helps you understand the project it's
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
a much more detailed it's a really good
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
synopsis but secondly when you pass a
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
project this
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
becomes legislative intent and we look
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
at it um later in the process like if an
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
agency wants to take the capital money
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
um when you're building building or
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
fixing a building you often change what
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
they're not permitted to change to
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
deviate from the purpose of what this is
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
because this is thought to be what you
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
approved this is this is thought to be
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
what you are saying yes to so uh
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
famously I think four years ago HHS
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to do windows instead of doors I
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
think it was maybe it was doors instead
 
00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:19.789 align:start position:0%
think it was maybe it was doors instead
of

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
Windows and and somebody said to them
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to tell you who it is
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
but his name is Chris and um but
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
somebody said to them door is not a
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
window and you need to get legislation
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so and it's because the item was
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
very specific to it wasn't openings as
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
you see fit to make the building safe it
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
was you want to do windows for this
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
purpose you change your mind and you
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
want to do doors for a different purpose
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
he's like well that's not what they
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
approved and so so that's why this book
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
is also very important because it's
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
binding um it it's it is a description
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
of legislative intent
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
um so the governor will present a budget
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
presentation um but every agency
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
understands that where the rubber really
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
hits the road I mean not that we don't
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
all do exactly what the governor tells
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
us to every day every moment and I would
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
like that on the record um the um but um
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
house Public Works is what matters I I
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
remember eight years ago I said to
 
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.789 align:start position:0%
remember eight years ago I said to
Governor

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
sonunu um he had a couple of ideas for
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and I said at the end
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
of the day we're just going to do
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
whatever Jean Chandler wants so why
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't we just start by asking him if
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
this is okay and
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
um that was literally true he we got
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
everything je Chandler was okay with and
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
there were a couple things he didn't
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
like and they didn't make it um that was
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
then this is now it's a very different
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
regime Mr chairman but I'm sure um just
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
just tell the governor that I don't
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
spell my name that way you give give her
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
a different spelling in case case
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
there's any beefs about this that's what
 
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
there's any beefs about this that's what
I'll

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
do um so what I want to do now is talk
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
about our budget and we're going to end
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
with Karen talking about lapses and and
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the items we don't want to lapse but um
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you what is included
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
and what we would like you to consider
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
also including so the governor's office
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
funded 1.5 million um this is slide 14
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
actually uh 1.5 million for the
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
emergency fund which we which is
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
something we fund every year um the
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
annex is being renovated if you've been
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the annex lately it's it's kind of a
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
mess um I mean not my office obviously
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
but the rest of it is kind of a mess um
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
but good things are happening every time
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
I hear an anvil drop on the floor over
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
my head and think it's going to come
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
through I say I bet that's progress and
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
the floor will hold so far it has um but
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
the second half of that project is is
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
12.5 million 12.25 million and so that's
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
in here there's a sprinkler replacement
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
at DMV for 500 50,000 they funded and
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
the elevator at the main building the
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
main building being the oldest building
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the on the State Hospital campus the
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
big building where Corrections used to
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
be and isn't anymore and HHS is in a
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of the Wings it's that building
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
elevator really bad and it breaks
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
constantly um more so than the other
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
state elevators which break a lot this
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
one breaks constantly so that that's
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
that now um we did a nice chart Karen
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
did the slides by the way I'm going to
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
take credit for them but you'll you'll
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
know that she actually did them so if
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
they look nice it's it's because of her
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
and um if you really like them though
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
you could give me credit cuz I asked her
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
to do them so I should get some credit
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
for that um so historically we um this
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
is how much money has been allocated to
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
das projects and recent Capital budgets
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
and I do this because it's a lot less
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
less this year than it has been in the
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
past and and even though the total
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
amount the governor is proposing to fund
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
is higher than it has I think been
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
ever ever
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
um and and that's to
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
say if it were me and I knew the
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
condition state buildings were in I'd
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit more money on fixing
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
up state buildings um and I'm going to
 
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
tell you the the two things that I want
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
to ask you to do um but but I but I say
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
this to say we're not asking for a
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
greater share the pie than we think we
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
should get but we're asking we're hoping
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
that you might think about at least
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
among your competing interests bringing
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
us up to sort of historic levels for
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
what we do um Karen's going to talk
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
about the the project she and her team
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
went through in in a triage to come up
 
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
with but before she does that I'm going
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
to skip ahead of slide to slide 17 and
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the Erp system the basic
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
computer system I actually have the the
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
entire piece from the CIP book here um
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a complicated system and I
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
wanted you to have it for your records
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
but the Erp system is a computer system
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
that runs the state it it runs payroll
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
it runs HR it runs finances it runs the
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
budget it runs everything supply chain
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
Etc we are we are upgrading it we're
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
going through a massive upgrade to take
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
it to the cloud and the most significant
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
um redo of the system since 2009 um when
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
we first went live with what was then
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
Lawson and is now in for it's called New
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first but it is an Erp it is
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
the enterprise
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
system um historically we um it has been
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
important to have a fund for
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
sustainability and advancement which
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
means upgrading it modernizing it adding
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
modules that you need as they become
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
available so that you can uh you can put
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
them into the system it is particularly
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
important this year because of a because
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're upgrading and one of the things
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
that happens in a project that will
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
eventually kill half of my staff
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
probably or at least give them all
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
stress related time off
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
um you find things you discover things
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
and and computers are ridiculously
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
expensive now that's just the way it is
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
but what we would ask you to look at is
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
um as we find synergies and
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities and I identify one that
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
works for Treasury and and things
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
related to it um like uh cash management
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
and bank reconciliation
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
um it's important for us over the course
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the two years to be able to tap into
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
that and we ask for about $5 million for
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
that and I'd like you to if you would
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
consider that it it it is of critical
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
importance to running that system um and
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
and it's something that committee has
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
looked favorably on before I'm going to
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
ask Karen to talk to you about five
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
particular um maintenance type projects
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
that she has
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
identified great thank you um so as
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
Charlie mentioned mened um in the
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
previous slide um the projects included
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
in the governor's version of the capital
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
budget were a lot less than in the past
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
um and a particular note there were no
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
projects included for the Bureau of
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
Court facilities so we maintain um all
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
of the 21 state-owned cour houses in the
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
state as and we also um enter into
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
leases for the remaining ones but um the
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
ones that we own you know have needs
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
like the rest of our buildings do and I
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
realize that the the top request of the
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
judicial branch was for the new Sullivan
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
County Courthouse which is a lot um but
 
00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
if that cannot be funded there of course
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
additional maintenance projects that we
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
would love to have funded so I've listed
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
the top two prioritized projects here
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
which is um HVAC um maintenance for the
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth circuit court and the Coos
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
County courthouse at 4.3 million is the
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
DPW estimate on that one um and the
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
second one is boilers and controls for
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
Carol County and Lebanon circuit court
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
for 2.85
 
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.510 align:start position:0%
for 2.85
million

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
um additionally I mentioned earlier that
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
we did a a thorough facility condition
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and because of that we moved
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
around our priorities a little bit we
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
realized that our main building um
 
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
exterior brick as well as the annex
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
which is the building right next to it
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
um is deteriorating and so we're
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
requesting 600,000 to repoint the brick
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
on that facility um over the last you
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
know eight or so or 10 years we've been
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
slowly replacing windows of all of those
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
older buildings over on the hospital
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
campus Spalding is one that we haven't
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
done yet which is in dire need of um
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
some new windows um so that's a $1.6
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
million request there and then as
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
Charlie mentioned earlier our elevators
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
specifically on that campus I think just
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
particularly due to the age of the
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
buildings and how long elevators have
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
been uh in there um our Brown building
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
elevators also need in need of
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
replacement so that's um a
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
um happy to answer questions on any of
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
that unless you would like us to first
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
lapses um why don't you go ahead and
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
talk about the lapses and then we'll
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
come back and we'll ask questions for
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
that well I might have questions on the
 
00:26:13.799 --> 00:26:15.710 align:start position:0%
that well I might have questions on the
lapses

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
lapses
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
also Karen's going to talk about lapses
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't know anything
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
about um and again I won't go through
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
detail on every single one but if you
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
have questions on any particular ular
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
one I will be more than happy to answer
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
those questions I have some notes with
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
me um and she's going to talk from the
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
list that's in the back of
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
this yes page
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
seven um so starting at the bottom of
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
page seven these are in order of the
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
newest projects first um and we'll go on
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
first eight projects were approved in
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
bium can I just interrupt for a second
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
just so if the members don't have the
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
pink book you've got a spreadsheet that
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
I dropped on your in front of you you
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
along thank you okay so the first eight
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
projects approved um in
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
2023 um those are all currently under
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
construction um so we're asking to
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
extend all of those um the next chunk of
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
projects from 2021 there's a lot um and
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
the reason there's so many from
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
2021 um is because that's when the AR
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
arpa money came available and I think a
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
lot of projects were moved out of the
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
capital budget to arpa funds and then
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
there was room in the capital budget for
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
additional projects and so we have a lot
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
of projects um from 2021 additionally I
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
think Public Works resources has been
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
very busy with arpa projects and so some
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
of these are taking longer than they
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
normally would have because the arpa has
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
become a priority d to the funds lapsing
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of calendar 26 I will just to
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
to add to that in terms of construction
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
generally we're not going to get any
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
anything you approv done in two years we
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
we might
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
accidentally a simple project but but
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
there is U because of arpa because of um
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
construction demand because of a
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
Slowdown during the covid years there is
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
a sort of a backlog and so what Ted's
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
team does is they do the next project
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
next and then the next one next and the
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
next one next and so you'll notice this
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
will be a theme that there are just a
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
ton of projects that are taking um from
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
passage of the capital budget to
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
completion of the project four to six
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
years not not two to
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
three there um there is one project in
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
the 2021 list it's um for the Hillsboro
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
Cooling and control so I'm going to try
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
um if you would could you just clarify
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think you stated down to number
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
eight was uh current projects that are u
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
under construction now um and then these
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
2021s they go to what number on the list
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
just help me make sure I know where I am
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
on yep so
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
202 is it 32 I just want to make sure
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's a
 
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.350 align:start position:0%
and then there's a
different

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
too do you want to use the the this is
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
what I have yeah let see here so parents
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to switch and use the house bill
 
00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
25 list because they're number as
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to the government's budget if
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
that's easier for
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
you yeah yes okay um you're using a
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
worksheet that that Chris put out I
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
that oh okay right either way let's do
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
um Okay so were're talking about the
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
2021 projects that go through number
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
32 um there's one project that's
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
obviously not on the list because we
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
already indicated that it would lapse
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
and that was for the Hillsboro Cooling
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
and controls project um moving down to
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
projects

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
um again most a lot of these are still
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
under construction we do have a handful
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
that are complete and we have a a
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
request that we're will be submitting to
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
Capital project overview to re reassign
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
some of those funds to a project that's
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
not complete which is the Hillsboro
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
County um South cell block renovation
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
which was also approved in 2019 but has
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
not yet started and is um quite
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
considerably underfunded according to
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
the number that was
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated um in 20 the 20 17 projects
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
at number
 
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.789 align:start position:0%
at number
48

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
48
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
um we do have an additional project that
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
we have reviewed and is complete and we
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
will be lapsing and that's uh the
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester Court project and that
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
here no I'm sorry that's the Spalding
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
roof project number 49
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
um so that is complete and we will be
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
lapsing the remainder of those
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
funds that's number 49 is going to lapse
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
you um and the last I checked which I
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
believe was late last week there was
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
$81,000 remaining in that
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
appropriation um the Rochester Court
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
project um boiler project had already we
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
had already indicated that that would be
 
00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:26.269 align:start position:0%
had already indicated that that would be
lapsing

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
lapsing
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
um starting at 54 there's um one project
 
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.230 align:start position:0%
um starting at 54 there's um one project
from

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
2015 um which we have some just small
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
amount of flooring that we're uh
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
finishing up at the Apple marker house
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
so that will be completed fairly quickly
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
um but we won't be lapsing that and then
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
um the final project Charlie is number
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
55 and I think you were going to speak
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
one it's a small amount of money
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
remaining that is for uh that we're
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
using as part of the the upgrade to the
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
Erp system
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
and so we're we're not going to we're
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
not going to lapse it in fact that's why
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you for more money and so
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
um we're go live is tentatively expected
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
by uh in early 2026 and at that point
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
that will be done but it won't be done
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
by July and
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
so so I'm afraid I I hope you won't
 
00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:22.230 align:start position:0%
so so I'm afraid I I hope you won't
lapse

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
it representative Jack any questions uh
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um just to clarify um
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
in from 2019 2b2 state house spacement
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
lapse number what number is that on uh
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a number because it's not in
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 so it would lapse I want
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
to confirm that they want to lapse that
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's state house basement fire
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
protection from 2019 yeah that project
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
is done it's actually not showing up on
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
my list which probably means there's no
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
money and then there was that you wanted
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
to repurpose through capital budget
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
overview and I didn't catch yeah so
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's actually a few projects from
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
2019 um I can list them if you'd like um
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
it includes Court Courthouse
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
generators um a new boiler at Coos
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
County Courthouse um Cooling and
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
controls at uh Rockingham and Hillsboro
 
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
County Courthouse
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
um various buildings that had roof
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
Replacements Andor exterior repairs and
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
the State House Annex elevator and
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
there's little amounts in all of those
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
like mostly 15,000 25,000 and we'd like
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
to T take all of that and put it towards
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro County South uh cell block
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
project if possible that's something we
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
can do in House Bill 25 if you want to
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
way and I think we were looking at doing
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
it through um capital budget
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
overview because it would happen faster
 
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:54.829 align:start position:0%
overview because it would happen faster
and

00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
we're timing matter and and that's
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
allowable um action of the capital
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
project overview committee as long as
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the same uh capital budget that
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're moving the same type of money to
 
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.950 align:start position:0%
they're moving the same type of money to
another

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
project and we've done this before with
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
the Department in that
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee thanks thank you
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
okay Senator Brown thank you Mr chairman
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
just a general question here so on these
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations do they typically have a
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
remaining schedule or expectancy and
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
what is still outstanding on that budget
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
item for the lapsed items I'm not
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
looking for it now but I'm just yeah I
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
would say for the most part I mean that
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County cell block I think is
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
just starting design um but that's an
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
anomaly most of these are either like in
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
design Design's been completed they're
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
either out to bid or somewhere in
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
construction so it's not like they're
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
we're waiting on them it's just as
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie was mentioned things are taking
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
four to six years instead of two to
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
three years just because of the backlog
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
of projects but gu my question chairman
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
um do they have a a projected schedule
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
and projected dollar amount by year how
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
do how do you guys do that yeah so we we
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have a schedule or an expected
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
completion date um if they haven't bid
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
yet then it would be hard to say like
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
what the the price is going to come in
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
at but if it has been bid then we
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
definitely have a a cost and usually
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's encumbered at the time that it's
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and Council so we
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
know exactly how much is remaining in
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
that account thank you thank you Mr
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
chairman okay representative
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
Jack uh well actually represent boget
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
was first but just to confirm so the one
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
action we're going to take is the lapse
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
number 49 with 81,000
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
remaining representative
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
buer yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you had some
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
laps in here uh using arpa money and is
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
there plans in place to complete those
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
jobs or is there alternative plans if
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
you can't complete those jobs for
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
funding for those projects
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
because my assumption is the money
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
disappears at the end so that's a drop
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
dead date
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
so so all of our arpa projects are
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be completed prior to the
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
December 26th uh drop dead date um some
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
of them are creeping into fall of 26 all
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
of them are fully funded at this point
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of Money's been encumbered
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
contracts have been signed um if there
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
becomes a situation where we find
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
something unexpected
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
there really is no other place to pull
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
pull money from as you know so we're
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
just we're doing as much as we can under
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
the current contract and the current
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
funding that we have to complete those
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
projects thank
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
you uh I will ask a question then and
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
this goes
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
back only because representative Karen
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
eel isn't on his committee anymore so
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and ask her question um
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
give us an overview once again on on
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
where we draw the line why you are
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
requesting on your little wish list for
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
the uh uh Erp system why that isn't
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
under doit why where does
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
Do's Authority stop or begin no it's a
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question I mean
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
technically every IT project is done in
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
consultation with and requires the
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
approval of
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
doit um agencies who are producing a
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
like a like I think justice has a case
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
management system which they will run
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
and operate they need Do's permission
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
for the purchase for the to decide what
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
it is how they're going to use it but
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
they'll manage the project the generally
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
it is centralized it with one exception
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
and that one exception is the state's
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
Erp system the financial human resource
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
system is run by my department by the
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
division of Enterprise application
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
management deem and it is the single
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
biggest area of state government that is
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
not directly under doit yet is it and so
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the one exception why is
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
it our request though it's because we're
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
managing the project our or in fact
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
Cassie is managing the project um and um
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
but we have to do it in consultation
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
with um with Dennis goule and and so
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
everything we do he has to sign off on
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you that's sort the general
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
clarification because I I I didn't go
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
through every line so far in our little
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
pink book
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
but in the past we've had new for
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
instance in this in this case if if it
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
was a Judicial System it would even
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
though it was a
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
doit item it would come under the
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
judicial budget it would come out of
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
their money so it's sort of like Mr
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
chairman if you think about it this way
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're we're going to do a bunch of
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
building projects where there will there
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
will be a contract for the building for
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
um like fishing game for example
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
there'll be a contract for the building
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
between my department and the contractor
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be managed by the division of
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
Public Works which is in my department
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
yet the funds are being appropriated to
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
fishing game and so it's just because
 
00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:11.150 align:start position:0%
fishing game and so it's just because
it's

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
their build when it's done they'll
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
manage it thank you any other questions
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
here representative okay thank you Mr
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
chairman a question of General about the
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
under administrative Services Bureau of
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
Court facilities uh I noticed you're I
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
think you're me asking for some projects
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
repair projects the
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
ahac but I'm wondering is there a list
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I've seen this list before of court
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
houses all around the state are on the
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
priority list to be either renovated or
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
completely constructed and the reason I
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
asked is obviously in the brown book
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
that Sullivan County has a request that
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
is in the brown book and I know probably
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's not in this budget but is is a
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
possibility and I ask this on behalf of
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
my County manager who is in the same bus
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
building among others but if you have
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
such a list could you share it with this
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of this committee because some
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
of us may be interested in where our
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
cour houses stand yeah annually we do a
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh with the court system there's a
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
process called the court accreditation
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee and then they produce a
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
document which happened to be finalized
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
last week um I I got mine in I got a
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
electronic version and mine came in the
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
mail yesterday um so I can get you that
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
copy which is a multi-year plan in
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
addition to that if you want to look at
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
um to get a sense if you look in our
 
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
list and you look at the Grid in the in
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
the CIP book and you look at the grid
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
um this this order is roughly um
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
although it's mixing all of our projects
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's not just courts but the court the
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
order of them is roughly the priority
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
order so you you'll see
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
the the sixth project is a $34 million
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
Courthouse sixth Pro and that's not
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
their sixth project that's our sixth
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
project um but I'll get you a copy of
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
the Court Prior the official document
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
that they publish um and I'll send that
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
to Mr Shay
 
00:42:14.839 --> 00:42:16.349 align:start position:0%
to Mr Shay
um

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
today okay thank you follow thank you Mr
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
share I know I will be interested and
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for so giving us that
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
information thank you by the way we're
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
if you decide
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
that you agree that Sullivan County
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
needs a new courthouse and you want to
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
spend 34 million on that instead of 4
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
million on HVAC we won't won't
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
object I wouldn't be holding my breath
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
about that but we'll take it under
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
consideration representative Newman you
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you do any of the
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
guest toits estimates that you have done
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
up to this point I'm I'm sensitive to
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
say this here I don't know any other way
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
to say it do the new tariffs that are
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
coming into play have any effect or
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated effect on materials supplies
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
in you want to to go first that yeah uh
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no uh we were
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
anticipating tariffs uh coming in
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
although I I will say that we have some
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
projects that are out to bid and uh
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
awaiting governor and Council approval
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
and we're hearing from those
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
contractors uh questions what what if by
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
the time we get uh notice to proceed uh
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
after governor and Council approval what
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
what will happen to those projects that
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing tariffs with and we
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for that right
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
yet thank you we're doing a lot of work
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
as a as in department on the purchasing
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
side and the construction side to try to
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
get a handle on that but until we know
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
what tariff is on what um I will say
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
that we uh the legislature passed a law
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
a year ago requiring American Steel on
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
projects of more than a
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
million so that already factors in
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat I mean leaving aside that
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
American seal might go up because
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
there's tariff protection too but
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
um we we won't really know until we know
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
a lot more about what tariffs look like
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
and and I think and particularly how
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
they relate to Canada right
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
Lan representative jurus thank you Mr
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
chairman a lot of a lot of projects seem
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
to be uh in the you know estimated in
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
the process for uh upgrading
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
HVAC uh and
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
boilers uh is there any in any of these
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
efforts are we considering heat pumps
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
are we considering solar hot water to
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
help with the boilers uh roofs are we
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
considering when we do a roof maybe
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
possibly adding affable Vol TS yes so um
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC is tricky we did a lot of HVAC with
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
arpa a lot of our HVAC systems are past
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
their useful life and a lot of our
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
buildings still don't have HVAC so it's
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
continuously going to be a high priority
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
of request on our Capital list um we are
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
doing some heat pumps um the annex
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
renovation has a little bit of um of
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
that um we're trying to use them where
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um we've done a few solar PV
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
systems in recent years that we do most
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
of that happens through our energy
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
saving performance contract program
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
which is separate than this Capital
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
process um solar hot water we did a
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
little bit I don't know 10ish 15 years
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
ago I feel like it hasn't been I feel
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
like the PV has kind of taken off and
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
become more efficient and the hot water
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't as as popular anymore as it
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
was um so we do look at all those things
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
in addition um there's a requirement to
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
look at a renewable energy component for
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
all large capital projects so we review
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
that and where it's cost effective we're
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
adding those
 
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
in thank you any other qu any other
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you uh thank you Mr
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um the question I have goes
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
back to DPW section um in there you
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned U
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh that you charge a fee for your
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
services for contracts so list take
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
hypothetically the uh U uh fishing game
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
where you're going to do a project for a
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
building hypothetically they're going to
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
pay for the building and you'reall going
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
to manage the project and y'all charge a
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
fee for that service right so
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh um our involvement with the project
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
starts when uh the using agency who's
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
been appropriated the money submits a
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
work request
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
West and some of those projects are
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
capital projects some of those projects
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
are what we call maintenance projects
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
they're you using their operating budget
 
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
to do those projects so a work request
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
comes to us and we assign that
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
particular project to a project manager
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
an engineer or an architect that has
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
experience in that kind of work that
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
kind of building
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
work um that project
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
manager uh employs an outside consultant
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
to help us with the design so now our
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
project manager is managing an outside
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
consultant and coordinating between the
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
design work from the outside consultant
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
and the using agency so let's say liquor
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
wants to build a new liquor store right
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um liquor knows how to sell booze um but
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
they don't know that much about building
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
they don't know that much about building
building

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
so but they know what they they know
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
what it want they want it to look like
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
they know how they want the product
 
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
displayed they know how they want their
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
parking lot to interface with their
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
entrance and where the cash registers
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
are so they have this vision of what the
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
building is going to look like and we're
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
the middleman transferring that Vision
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
to the consultant so we can have
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
construction documents that we can put
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
out to bid
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
once the project the design project is
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
complete those project managers then
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
package that up into bid documents put
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
it out to bid evaluate the
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
bids um choose the low
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
bidder and then package it up uh to go
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
to governor and counsel once governor
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
and Council approves the project we can
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
issue a notice to proceed to that low
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
bid contractor who was awarded the
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
project and now the project manager at
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
DPW manages the construction project to
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that that building for liquor
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
is built according to the plans and
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
specifications that were designed by the
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
consultant it's a lot of work um and by
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
law uh we're required uh to charge using
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
agencies a fee for the work that we do
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
projects and those fees are included in
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
our capital budget estimates as well
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
follow up when if I can to clarify
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
something about on a budgeting
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint this is I think 21 I 82 but
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere in our statute and when Public
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
Works was set up the decision was or the
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
thought was for generally funded things
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
we're using general funds but for
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
Federal fund projects and Highway fund
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
projects and other fund projects we want
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of those funds so
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're not we're legally required
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
to charge and then the idea is is to
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
recoup um non-general fund share that
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
way in addition to that um in recent
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
years capital projects have been added
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
to that and and it's a way of not using
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
general funds more than um the state has
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
to in certain ways to maximize other
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
funds like you have the ent ent General
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
as 100% federally funded project or
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge for that to recoup
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of running um a division of
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
Public Works and um and and I think it
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
was about 12 14 years ago when Senator
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
Morris was then Senator Morris was on
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
the capital budget committee and the
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
Senate that language was uh basically
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
mandating that we also have clerks and
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
that they be paid out of capital funds
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
on that which is why there's a there's
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
typically a footnote in the capital
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
budget to that effect follow just one
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
followup with that I'm going to break
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
this to see if I understand it down to
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
layman's term a little bit the fees you
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
charge offset the cost of running your
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
department which is charged against the
 
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
department which is charged against the
general

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
fund yes yeah that's good simplistic
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
right that's much better than I did and
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the fees the fees the fees don't
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
cover our entire operating budget just
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
offsets correct thank
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
boy thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner for making my taking my
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
question regarding the uh
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
erps $5 million to modernize the entire
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
system buys us an additional 10 years is
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
that how I'm reading the narrative in
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
the perspectus it it's actually more
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
like 20 this five is is extra and and we
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
get we get at least 10 years out of it
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
but the the project is ongoing right now
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
with um a $12 million contract with with
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
in4 a separate contract with a company
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
called axum which is an implementer uh
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
an ivnv contract with a with another
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
company and and this is this is an
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
addition to that but um we will yeah we
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
get another 10 years at least out of the
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
system but like every computer system we
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
have to upgrade it over time because if
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
you don't there you end up like a lot of
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
State systems there's two 80-year old
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
men who the only people left who know
 
00:52:33.069 --> 00:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
how to run it and they both want to move
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
to Florida that's actually a actual case
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
of a system that we have today I think
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
they're 82 and
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
78 um quick pivot only go I I probably
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
didn't ask this question two years ago
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
but now I it's going to be a newbie
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
question in my third term but what is
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the Statewide emergency
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
fund and what's the current balance of
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
it um I'll get the current balance in a
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
minute but the Statewide emergency fund
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
we have we have an enormous deductible
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
on our buildings and and the idea is
 
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
on our buildings and and the idea is
that

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
um I think everybody knows this that our
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
state buildings are not in great shape
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say they're they're a
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
dump but roofs leak pipes are bursting
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
infastructure I I get a text from Karen
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
at least once a week saying just FYI the
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
X in this building is down and we don't
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
know why but we're figuring it out I'll
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
get back to you in an hour and um and uh
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
are deductible on on insurance policies
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
it is a million on every
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
building uh just doing a quick um look
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
here because what we do get this
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated every bium it's been lately
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
one to1 and A5 million dollar per every
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
two years um there are currently little
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
bits remaining in the older accounts um
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
and by little Min bits I mean like
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
36,000 in one there's 4,000 in another
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
one um so if you add up the four open
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
accounts it's just over one and a half
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
million that's left um and I do always
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
like to add too that we have a a
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
building insurance policy for our larger
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
buildings for catastrophic events with a
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
$1 million deductible and so if we were
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
to have a catastrophic event we would
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
use at least a million dollars of that
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of go towards the replacement of
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
that building cost so we like to have at
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
least that much kind of in the in the
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
kitty so to speak just a quick quick
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
followup to so just in simplistic terms
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like having a capital
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
reserve fund municipalities have capital
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
reserve funds it's kind of your capital
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
reserve for those you know emergencies
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
as as you've titled it so correct and
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
I'll just clarify that every agency that
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
owns State Property is allowed to
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
request funds from that and so we've
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
supported Department of Corrections
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
we've supported the Liquor Commission
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
we've supported um dncr in you know when
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
they have an event um that they aren't
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
able to cover with their with their
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
regular operating budget okay thank
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative jur
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman we Das and Public
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
Work let lets a lot of contracts and you
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned the choosing the lowest bidder
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
is that the lowest most responsible
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
bidder or is it usually just the lowest
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
bidder it's so it's
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the lowest bidder but a
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
typical project is Bid through the do
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
contracts office and do and Public Works
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
used to be in the same department and
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
since 2005 they aren't but the contracts
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
office wasn't split it's there um there
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
are biders that are pre-qualified for
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of projects and can be un
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
pre-qualified if things don't go well um
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
which doesn't happen a lot but it does
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
happen and so the the project is we
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
typically use a design bid build method
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
where the plans are the plans it's not
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's not that flexible and and it's very
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
very um precise and um there are
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
requirements you have to meet to be able
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
to bid but once you do if you're low
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
you're low we have a public bid opening
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
and and the and everybody sort of gets
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
it in the load bid ons we've had very
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
few problems from that um we in large
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
part because we manage and it's why we
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
have a public works but we've famously
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
have had a few and uh there was a the
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
Regional training facility at at the
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
guard uh about 10 12 years ago um was a
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
cataclysmic failure and um cost the
 
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
state millions of dollars and insurance
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
companies millions of dollars but um bad
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
company but we don't we think we know
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
who the bad companies are and they don't
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
get to
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
bid thank
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
you any further questions Mr chair
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
represent restive cludia okay thank you
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair commissioner Arling house and I
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
think I asked you this question two
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
years ago in a similar capital budget
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
hearings as far as electric vehicles I'm
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
sure some of the employees and
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
contractors who work at state agencies
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
have electric or hybrid vehicles which
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
any either way have you built some
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
charging stations or facilities for
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
those vehicles uh you know obviously
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
certain percentage maybe 10 20% and I
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
mean I don't seem to see it maybe such a
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
minuscule expense but I'm just curious
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
about I sometimes get questions from
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
reps outside this committee uh who are
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
curious about that we we have there
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
there's no State policy right now on on
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
whether you do or don't but we have um I
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
know it was looked at for the parking
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
garage that's going
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
up wherever it is over there yeah there
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
um and I don't remember if it made it
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
into or not because we did whatever the
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislator was told us to do um we had
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
built charging uh char stations behind
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
the boiler house over here um recently
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
and and in some other projects I can't
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
think of other ones off hand maybe I can
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
just add I I know Environmental Services
 
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
just add I I know Environmental Services
has

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
um uh EVS in their Fleet and so they
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
they have some charging stations at
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
their headquarters we found that the
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
best model honestly in my opinion is
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
that um the charging station is owned by
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
the like a charge point or a company
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
that does that and then they manage you
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
know the the finances and all those
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
pieces and they just get to put it on
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
our property and reimburse us for the
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
electricity they use um which means we
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to put out any Capital funds
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
to install
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairman are questions yes
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you seeing
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
us we have a couple minutes uh can you
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh refresh my memory education has an
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
item number 73 about bathrooms and if I
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
remember correctly that's the building
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
they're not in anymore so is that is
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
there oh in uh the laps item yes
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
yes I'm trying to think what are we
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
doing on the I mean I know we're okay
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
laan okay so laan Hall which is the
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
former headquarters for the New
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education uh Department um
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
they moved out and we dis purchased the
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
building at Hall Street where they are
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
now so that is now their headquarters um
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
because the laan hall was empty during
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
when arpa funds were distributed we
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
requested arpa funds to fully renovate
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
that building so it's gutted um it it's
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
slated to be completed September October
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
of this year um we've rolled the funding
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
for the bathrooms the capital funding
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated for the bathrooms
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
into that arpa project so the bathrooms
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
project any other further
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you very much
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
you next up we have the department of
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
Information Technology if they're here
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
we can start them a couple of minutes
 
01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
we can start them a couple of minutes
earlier

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
ah don't know why they didn't let them
 
01:00:41.720 --> 01:01:25.670 align:start position:0%
ah don't know why they didn't let them
in

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:51.589 align:start position:0%
 
let

01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.599 --> 01:02:07.589 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
good morning gentlemen welcome to Public
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
Works morning good morning Mr chair go
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
right ahead all right good morning Mr
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee uh my
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
name is Dennis goule I am the
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and with me today
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
is Deputy Commissioner Ken Dunn
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
I would like to just let you know um
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
Chris Shay uh emailed out the
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
presentation last night and there was a
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
small error in it so the one you have
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
now is corrected and we'll get out a
 
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:39.559 align:start position:0%
corrected one to you um essentially it
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
was the second line in on page two that
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
was incorrect so we'll cover that um so
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
so I'll jump right into it uh looking at
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
page two um these are the what we
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
perceive as the Technology based capital
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
projects that are were funded in in the
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and uh so we looked at
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
them a couple different ways um for
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
appropriateness sake one is um what
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
priority was the project in the agency's
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
um request list so you can see that um
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
pretty appropriate except for ours and
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll cover that uh we only had
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
three and the priority three was
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
funded um but if you look at the other
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
ones there you know they were either the
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
first or the third and in the case of
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
HHS um they're pretty important those
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
are among the three largest and most
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
important systems in the state that
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
being the Medicaid and the eligibility
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
systems so so the um you know in terms
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
of the question as to whether you know
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the appropriate projects were
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
funded we think that in most cases that
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
is is correct um so moving on to page
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
three I will take you through uh what we
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
what our request was we really had three
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
three projects we requested one was
 
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.710 align:start position:0%
three projects we requested one was
cyber

01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
cyber
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
security um it service management phase
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
two phase one was funded in in the
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
current bium and then Cloud Solutions
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
and services and um so you can see our
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
priority three is funded in the
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and um we'd like to
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
ask that that be adjusted um we've the
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
cyber security challenges for all
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
organizations and state governments no
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
different um continue to change and
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
evolve and get more
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
complicated um with the benefit of
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in the last most recent
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bia we've been able to just keep up with
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
the challenges of protecting the state's
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
data and and now our continuity of
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
government in the past early days cyber
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
it was protecting data which of course
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
is important the privacy of Citizen data
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
but now with the Advent of ransomware
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
continuity of government is really an
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
issue as well so we're working hard on
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
that and we think it appropriate that um
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
if nothing else got funded this that the
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
cyber security uh Capital be funded so
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
our request would be to fully fund cyber
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
security enhancements and to reduce
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
cloud services down to $850,000 that
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
will get us part of the way down the
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
road for what we had planned and um
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
continue that moving along and and then
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
remove it service management phase two
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
why are we asking for that well in in
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
the context of other reductions that
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
we've made in our operating budget we we
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
decided to slow that program down so
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
that you know that would help us make
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
some savings on the operation Operation
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
budget side so we thought it appropriate
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
that that priority to be removed at this
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
time so so I'll pause there for a second
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
before before we move on to um the
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
explanations of the projects themselves
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
just in case there are any questions
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
right there any questions yes represent
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
below thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so on the
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
area of cyber security can you sort of
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
give us
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
some I don't I guess data I mean how I
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
mean how severe is the need I mean and
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
how can you sort of demonstrate that
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
need well if we if we look at um the
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
the um State as a whole in our Ci's
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
towns and K through 12 it's almost every
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
week we're seeing a a city or a town or
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
a k through 12 being either ransomed or
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
having money stolen from them and it's
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
been very impactful throughout the state
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
um we haven't had that happen in the
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
executive branch during my tenure we've
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
had a couple breaches that we've managed
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
one early in days which was a Health and
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
Human Services data breach um but but
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
literally um we have um about
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
82% of all of our emails are not being
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
delivered to an inbox now because they
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
have some sort of um malware or um you
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
know bad actor
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
attempts um we're seeing very regular um
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
attempts to infiltrate our Network in
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
fact the protections we have on end
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
points um right now have um stopped at
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
least three three significant major
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
ransomware attempts in the last couple
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
of years and and if just to remind that
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
the committee ransomware is is
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
exceptionally bad you you know those
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
organizations you're seeing that just
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
complete completely fall off the map and
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
stop being able to do business that is
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
the result of ransomware what the what
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
the Bad actors do now is they'll they
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
will if they can get into one system it
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
used to be they'd get into one or two
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
systems and they would Ransom that
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
system and try to collect a little money
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
money now what they do is they will
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
they'll be patient particularly if it's
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
a large organization where they can feel
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
like they can extract money they will
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
get into a system and they will work
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
what they call horizontally which is
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
moving to other systems and get as many
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
systems as they can and get to your
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
backups if they can which is an
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
important note is you know we're working
 
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
one of the projects we're working on now
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
is to to update our backup system so
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
that we're sure that we have you know a
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
separation between the actual data and
 
01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
separation between the actual data and
the

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
backups once they've infiltrated a bunch
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
of systems then they will extract as
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
much data as they can so that even if
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
you have backups they will have caused a
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
data breach as part of that then they'll
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
hit the button and take all your systems
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
out and start communicating with you and
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
and try to extort money from you so it's
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
a real risk you're seeing it happen all
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
over the country we we're seeing it
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
happen inside the state of New Hampshire
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
and we're doing our best to protect it
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
followup thanks again thank you for that
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer so you mentioned something about
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh in the state so are you so how does
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
how do you work with uh local towns and
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
school districts and so on is is this
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
part of is this in your budget to do
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
that no um this is this money is just
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the um the executive branch um but
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
what we do we do have two other funding
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
sources that um we that are um Grant
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
related um one is historical which is we
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
get we typically uh get a small chunk of
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
the homeland security Grant monies
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
through the department of safety and uh
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
we we sit on that evaluation committee
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
for those grants and and we'll get a a
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
piece of that we've historically moved
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh used that money to provide services
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
for cities towns and K through 12 and
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'll explain that a little further once
 
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
I talk about the second funding source
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's a as part of the infrastructure
 
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed by the federal
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
government there was a piece of that is
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars for all the states
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
called the state and local cyber grant
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
program and so basically New Hampshire I
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
think was originally allocated around
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
14.6 over four years we had a whole
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
bunch of Hoops we had to jump through to
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
access those funds but we did
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
successfully jump through those Hoops in
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire was the very first
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
state to get year one approved approval
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
which we're proud of and we've been
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
using that money as well and we we have
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
a number of programs that we we have a
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
public private partnership you you may
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
be aware that uh
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
primex has the um you know creates uh uh
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
has the risk pool for most of the Cities
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
towns and K through 12s in New Hampshire
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
so what we do is we make sure that
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
whatever Prim X's programs are we're
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
doing something complimentary vice versa
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
so if primex is training for example
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
their customers in a certain area uh
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
they're insured in a certain area then
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
we're making sure we don't duplicate
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
that effort so we're kind of partnering
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
up to make sure that the total effort
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
between us and and and they and and in
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association we get
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
feedback from them on what's needed and
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
how to best approach these
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities so those monies those two
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
pots of monies were effectively um
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
moving out through programs not through
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
subg grants because what we found is
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
these cities and towns don't have the
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to figure out what to do
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
with that money if if we had it also we
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't have the
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
economies of scale we're able to get if
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're buying something for the entire
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
State we we can get the economies of
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
scale for that as well so it's really
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
two separate programs uh the other thing
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
we do is we partner closely with our
 
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
other branches of government including
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
the general court and our constitutional
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
offices to um coordinate cyber effort
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
for this for the state
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
government hope that
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
helps representative
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
jurus thank you Mr chairman so you
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
originally the security enhan cyber
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
security enhancements were denied but
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to make that adjustment by
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
deferring pushing off the it management
 
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.510 align:start position:0%
deferring pushing off the it management
phase

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
tool make sure I mean what what I would
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
ask is is that we
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
we we eliminate itm service management
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
phase two we fully fund cyber security
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
and we partially fund Cloud Solutions
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
and services thank you I respectfully
 
01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
request that thank
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Brown thank you Mr
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
chairman so you talked about the
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
coordinated efforts against the schools
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
and everything else in the state is
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
there an active program with the uh with
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the counties to make sure because I know
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
for instance the sheriff's departments
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
and all those have
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
direct interaction with the AG and and
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
all that so I'm trying to figure out how
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
how does that work because I know we're
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
working in our County on upgrading our
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
systems too it's a really good point sir
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
um the we'll work with whoever will work
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
with us and that does include um you
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
know a number of law enforcement
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
entities around around the state as well
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
as because like a city is not always one
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
entity it varies a lot so you know in a
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
in a we may end up working with the the
 
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
the city um it folks or the city
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
government and then we were in that same
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
city we might be separately working with
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or or police and fire
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know so it it it varies depending on
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
the entity but so things we're doing is
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
training both Technical Training for the
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
professionals who are there inside the K
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
through 12s and the technical
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
professionals but also cyber awareness
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
training that's targeted to those
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
individuals so that um and that's the
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
biggest thing right and we we call it
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
the human firewall if we all if we all
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
behave well and and we don't make
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
mistakes that's the best protection any
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
organization can have so a lot of cyber
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
awareness training the other thing we're
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
doing is um doov in a box it's a
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized program and what
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
why what does in a box mean it means
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
when we go somewhere and we help them
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
get their domain to.gov we take them
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
from where they are we help them so if
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's fairly Advanced we have less
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
work to do if they're less Advanced we
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
have more work to do but we tailor that
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
program to them um in fact General Court
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
um congratulations you all just moved
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
to.gov domain very recently and that's a
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
big deal um it was very a very
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
challenging project that was funded
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
under the state and local cyber grant
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
program monies that helped um Terry PF
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
and his team and all of you get to
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
accomplishment followup so do you have
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
active Outreach with the counties in the
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
towns to make sure that as they upgrade
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
their systems that uh they're
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
coordinated like you said with like with
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
the whole primx thing do and and and and
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
it it goes through and we've been
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
building that the out it's not easy to
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
get to all of these entities and we've
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
been doing this for years and years and
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
the momentum is now building and so we
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
have the relationships that are growing
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
and building and again it's through
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
primex it's through the New Hampshire uh
 
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association it's through being
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
invited to events to present so that we
 
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
can share what we have we have a website
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
out there that uh if you if you uh
 
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
Google um New Hampshire doit you'll see
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
the uh the programs are pretty well
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
defined out there the committee that
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
decides on the allocation of these state
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
and local cyber Grant funds uh which is
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
specified by uh sisa who administer ERS
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
the program and and FEMA who deals with
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
the funds requires that we have
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
representation from the cities towns K
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
through 12s and County governments uh on
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
that so that we're not just sitting in
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
an ivory Tower deciding what to do but
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
rather getting input from those folks so
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
typically what we'll have
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
is there's more to do than we have money
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
to do so prioritization is important and
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
we do involve those entities in the
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
prioritization of the work thanks for
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr chairman
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative Faulkner thank you Mr
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my question is what to what
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
extent do we rely on uh expertise at the
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
FBI other agencies in terms of U of
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
information and expertise in in
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
preventing cyber attacks and will
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
changes at the federal level affect what
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have to do
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
here so we partner very closely with the
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
sisa we have um that's okay
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
the legislation that was passed I want
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
to say maybe four years ago created a
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
position assisa coordinator for each
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
state we have a very involved sis
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
coordinator in New Hampshire I think one
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the best personally I think one of
 
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
the best in the country so we're we're
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
we benefit from that in fact we're doing
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
a a an exercise program later this week
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
with our our sisa
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
partners um and and that's and they're
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
all over the state trying to help out so
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
that's a huge help to us
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
FBI um we coordinate with them as well
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
in particular the FBI gets involved in
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
Secret Service Financial crimes division
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
in the cities towns and K through 12s if
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
there's a financial um aspect to a cyber
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
incident talk typically on the law
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement comes on the the back the
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
bad side of or incident response side of
 
01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
an incident so the other the other
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
things we do is we involve sisa in the
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
development and our uh hscm Homeland
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
Security Emergency Management Group over
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
at Department of Safety in the
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
development of our incident response
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
plan for cyber incidents and uh as as
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
you may know um they we look at our
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
incident command through hsem as an all
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
hazards approach so if it's a flood or
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
if it's a ice storm or a cyber event it
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
gets handled similarly uh where if we if
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
we declare an incident then hscm is
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
incident command and we support them so
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're only incident command for
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
the you know the minor relatively minor
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
cyber incidents in the state and then
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
should there be a major incident uh we
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
would bring in uh HSM would take
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
incident command and in that case
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the severity of the
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
incident we would then bring in the FBI
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
or um or the um secret service Financial
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
investigation any further questions
 
01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.950 align:start position:0%
investigation any further questions
representative

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you Mr chairman
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
um on page three of your thing you you
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
said you wanted to fund number one cyber
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
security and it was not approved but uh
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
Cloud Solutions and services was
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
approved uh could you tell me the reason
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
or the thought pattern behind why the
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
security portion was not approved and
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
the Cloud solution was
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
approved you know I I anticipated this
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
question and I don't know the answer to
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that um I could just give you a little
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
bit overview on that though we we
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
normally don't get into any of those
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
kind of wise and wherefores because this
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
just comes out of the governors and this
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
is strictly done on on on monetary needs
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
and and what their feel are otherwise
 
01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
obviously every one of these things
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
would have been improved in the order
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
that they wanted them
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
so we'll let you off the qu we'll let
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
you off the hook with that question sir
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
chair do we have any other further
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none let's please move
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
on to uh the uh laps extension
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
information um so now we're on page
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
eight is a summary of our existing
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
Capital appropriation you can see in the
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
second column the original appropriation
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
and the remaining funds so I would I
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
would call out that we you know we are
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
we are utilizing These funds
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
actively uh so the main takeaway from
 
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
the first page we are asking that that
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
most of them be extended and um if you
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
wish I can take you through starting on
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
page nine in detail each one where we
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
are but but what I can say in summary is
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
is that you know we have plans to to
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
responsibly utilize These funds um over
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
the next year and a half or so so I I
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
would ask that we extend all the ones
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
except for the the two on uh that you
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
saw on page eight that one of them's
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
complete and the other has just a small
 
01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:14.990 align:start position:0%
complete and the other has just a small
amount

01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
left representative Jack yeah so uh to
 
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
so we we've confirmed number uh this is
 
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to be uh between 122 and 12 so
 
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.950 align:start position:0%
going to be uh between 122 and 12 so
number

01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
124 on Enterprise GIS alignment you
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
would like to lapse yes and well yes and
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
and again we've
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
um we we will be uh the remaining funds
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
we were using right now to integrate
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
that that 15,000 that remains we
 
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
basically be a we expect a zero lapse on
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
that um because we're going to use those
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
remaining funds to further integrate
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
our our current GIS mapping capabilities
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
in with our case management and our
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
licensing system that's systems that are
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
running on um salesforce.com I just like
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
you to make sure that you can actually
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
pay all the bills that you're going to
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
get on that line item before the end of
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
year um because after that you won't be
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
able to pay them yes we'll do okay well
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we're saying we know we know
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to encumber it that's not
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
the same so it's oh yeah good point yeah
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
so if it's it needs to be paid we are we
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
are adding to uh work that's already
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
being done but I don't know we would get
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
that paid by the end of the calendar or
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
so probably best utilize it leave it as
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
is I think the encumbrance is the key
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
key thing there
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
lapses seeing
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
none uh further questions regarding
 
01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:00.030 align:start position:0%
none uh further questions regarding
their

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
presentation none seen thank you very
 
01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:05.719 align:start position:0%
much gentlemen thank
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
you one one more Marty j y uh pre the
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
previous presentation was from
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
administrative Services they allowed us
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
to how they operate the Erp system that
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
does payroll and finance for the State
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh am I we we did some work in previous
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
bium about wrapping everything into
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
hosting everything on your systems so
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
that there weren't any agencies that had
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
systems that you didn't that you didn't
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
operate and that gets them within your
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
security trust perimeter so is that an
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
accurate way of yeah well the um New
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a couple just interesting
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
points about New Hampshire we we are we
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
may be the most uh we may be the first
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
state that centralized uh it in the
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
country I think we mayit back in it
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
started back in 2003 and today we are
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
among the most centralized I think uh
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and and New
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we as far as the executive
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
branch of government the cyber security
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
policy is an umbrella over the entire
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
executive branch so and we operate what
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
we call a baseline plus uh policy so our
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
cyber um policies are in effect for all
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies and we we
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
hardly ever uh provide an exception to
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
those but what we do allow and and this
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
is appropriate is not all agencies carry
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
the same amount of or type of regulated
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
data so if the if the federal government
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
for example um requires let's take Dr
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
they have um you know they have the IRS
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
publication 1075 compliance requirements
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
we allow them to increase their cyber
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
posture improve it but not go back on it
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
so no agency can go below the Baseline
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
but an agency can go above the Baseline
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
for cyber security and and typically
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
they would do that to be in compliance
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
with a with a uh with a federal um
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
requirement so you know Dr is an example
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
HHS almost every agency has some um you
 
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
know compliance requirements we're we're
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
being almost continuously audited by
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
some entity whether it be a Federal
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
agency or by the uh payment card
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
industry because we do process a lot of
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
of credit cards especially in the in the
 
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.270 align:start position:0%
of credit cards especially in the in the
Liquor

01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
Commission further question yes
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative rockmore thank you Mr
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um I'm new to the
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
committee so I want to be sure I'm
 
01:25:43.119 --> 01:25:44.270 align:start position:0%
committee so I want to be sure I'm
understanding

01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
correctly my understanding from this
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
budget is that two years ago um you were
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
allocated over $2 million for cyber
 
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
security and now another over two
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
million is it so my question
 
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
is um is it your prediction that given
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
the current state of cyber crime in the
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
world that the state of New Hampshire
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
should expect to spend over a million
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
dollars a year on cyber security for the
 
01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.270 align:start position:0%
dollars a year on cyber security for the
foreseeable

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
foreseeable
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
future yes and and that that just keeps
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
us essentially it's a it's a it's a uh
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
capex to Opex hamster wheel um
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
essentially we invest in innovation in
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
cyberg to protect the state as it
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
changes during the bium should the
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh fund our
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
request and and then in the subsequent
 
01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
that'll result in some operating expense
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
that will be in the sub subsequent um
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
bium to maintain
 
01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
that and it keep the percentage of
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
that nationally keeps going going up I.E
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
the percentage
 
01:26:59.109 --> 01:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
of uh cyber investment in operating
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
expense as a percentage of the entire
 
01:27:01.159 --> 01:27:04.030 align:start position:0%
expense as a percentage of the entire
operating

01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
expense so it's never
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
done any further questions
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative jurus thank you Mr
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
chairman uh commissioner briefly what
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
kind of network topology does does the
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
uh it system uh in New Hampshire have is
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
it a Sonet system or is it ethernet
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
based totally and do we
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
do we have our own in-house cable plant
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
do we lease a lot of circuits like uh T1
 
01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.590 align:start position:0%
do we lease a lot of circuits like uh T1
circuits

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
circuits
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
Etc um so the the um state has a
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
um an
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
internet an Ethernet Network that um
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
encompasses um you know close to um 400
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
locations just for the state Network so
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would be an Ethernet in the in the
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
um the location itself like take a uh
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
I'll use a Health and Human Service
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
district office as an example they have
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
a network sitting there they are
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
connected to us via Carri ethernet uh we
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
have um you know almost 400 Carri
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
ethernet circuits in New Hampshire
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
connecting physical locations to the
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
Mothership at 27 Hazen so that's your
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
Hub um we have a core Network that in
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
multiple uh internet connections we have
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
two major internet connections that are
 
01:28:23.159 --> 01:28:24.910 align:start position:0%
two major internet connections that are
redundant

01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh with the appropriate Security on
 
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
those um both firewall as well as what
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
they call it IPS or an intrusion
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
protection system which allows us to do
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
things like geoblock we geoblock all
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
countries access to our Network except
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
for India and Canada Canada is more of a
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
um we we haven't experienced a lot of um
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
cyber attacks from Canada India is
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
because we actually have some
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
Contracting we have some contractors
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
that work in India for under contract
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
with a couple of different companies
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
that that we do business with that have
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
staff in India so we can't geoblock them
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
per se so um does that addition to the
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
400 locations there's a bunch of um
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
point-to-point VPN circuits that are
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
going into law enforcement entities and
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
the um the uh Town clerks and such
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
interfacing to DMV so the transactions a
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
a you know a registration transaction
 
01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
really has data that belongs both in the
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
in the city or town that's doing it as
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
well as you know data has to flow up to
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire further questions
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar uh thank you Mr
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
chair uh yeah thanks for taking my
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
question how is the security that's
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
arranged like with the secretary of
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
state for all the voting information I
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
know that that that's been in flux now
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
for a while the way we've been applying
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
our voting rules and
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
also you know the connections that are
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
made my my wife's are involved that so
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
um secretary estate scandin um has a
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
robust cyber security program we're
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
we're aware of it we partner with him we
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
we uh help each other out uh but
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
generally he has uh responsibility and
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
controls that and and um without sharing
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
in appropriate inappropriately sharing
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
details it's it's pretty in
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
depth oh thank you thank you Mr chair

huh have a a brief statement then I'll
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
open it up for for questions uh good
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
committee my name is James Gary and I'm
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
the governor I'm Governor AOS director
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
of policy and finance about a year ago
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
under Governor sonunu the state began
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
the process of putting together the
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget for the fiscal year 2026
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
2027 bium the various State departments
 
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
and agencies put together a list of
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
capital projects that they proposed
 
01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.870 align:start position:0%
capital projects that they proposed
funding

01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
last spring the Departments submitted
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
their request to the Department of
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office the capital budget
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearings took place on June 18th and
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
19th of last year and after the capital
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
budget hearings the administrative
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
Services Department priced the projects
 
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:12.910 align:start position:0%
Services Department priced the projects
last

01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
fall historically the state of New
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has funded in the neighborhood
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
of 120 to 130 million in capital
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
projects for each bium these projects
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
are paid for by the issuance of debt
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
that is secured by a general obligation
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
Pledge of the State of New Hampshire the
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
reason why we have typically not issued
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
significantly more is that there are
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
constraints on the amount of debt we can
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
issue our Capital position was
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
significantly improved with the recently

completed $990 million ARA allocation
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
from the federal government much of that
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
money going to capital projects but
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
while the state made a giant dent in the
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
pent up demand for long-term projects
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
much still needs to be done now there
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
are two main factors that constrain the
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
amount of debt that any municipality
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
including the state of New Hampshire can
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
issue New Hampshire is rated able A1
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
double A Plus able a plus by Moody
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
standard and pores and fit
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
respectively these rating agencies use
 
01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
debt levels as a main component in the
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
rating process rating agency guidelines
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
from all three rating agencies are
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
closely monitored by the state treasurer
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh we have been assured by the state
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
treasurer that the governor's proposed
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget is well within the rating
 
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
agency's State guidelines of course
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
rating agencies guidelines are just one
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
potential roadblock the other of course
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
is can you afford the debt how much one
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
pays when they issue debt depends on the
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
bond ratings the interest rates the time
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
of the borrowing you know uh time of
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
year and what the economic conditions
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
are and the length of the borrowing term
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
for a typical $140 million deal at
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
current interest rates one would expect
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
deck service payments in the
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of a just under $9 million
 
01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.669 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of a just under $9 million
per

01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
year typically bonds will be issued with
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
the final maturity ranging anywhere from
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
15 to 30 years naturally they should
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
match the useful life of the project New
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has tended to frontload their
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
debt so the bonds amortise at a faster
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
rate than is typical for a state general
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
obligation Bond the rapid amotization of
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
debt has benefited New Hampshire by
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
lowering our levels of debt which has
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
led to a direct impact on New Hampshire
 
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining in even improving the
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
State's bond
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
ratings when the uh various departments
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
put their Capital requests together
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
their list was quite extensive in fact
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
the total amount submitted was just over
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
$1.3 billion with over 1.1 billion
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
coming from the general fund
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
sources with the state typically issuing
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
under 150 million of generally obligated
 
01:36:58.990 --> 01:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
of generally funded uh bonds uh just for
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
retrospect in the current banum we
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
issued 130 million in the capital budget
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
with an additional 40 million coming
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
from an off- budget
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
session the governor had to whittle down
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
the list to something that the rating
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
agencies would accept and something we
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
could afford the governor's capital
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
budget does just that her Capital uh
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
budget has projects totaling 143 million
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
million payable from the fer fund and 27
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
million coming from all funding sources
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
government this diverse set of 41
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
projects the governor has identified
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
come from 16 different departments and
 
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
agencies within the state mercifully I
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
will not go through each of these
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
projects however they are projects there
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
are projects that I do want to single
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
out for your attention for
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
administrative Services their largest
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
risk is the 12.25 million ask for the
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
state Annex Renovations this is actually
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
phase two of a two-phase renovation
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
project phase two will
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
renovate the remaining office wings uh
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
into combined open and enclosed office
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
space and renovate the basement into
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
limited office space conference rooms
 
01:38:13.149 --> 01:38:13.159 align:start position:0%
and mechanical spaces it should be noted
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
that the annex is a traditional home of
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
Services the state treasurer the
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and parts of
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's and Governor's
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
Office three more projects are at the
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh the state of and this
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't come as a a shock to many of
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
you but the state of New Hampshire needs
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
a new Men's prison to date the
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
legislature has authorized a total of 50
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
million for the new prison 40 million of
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
this authorization was in the form of
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
long-term debt that is yet to be issued
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
in all reality it will take almost
 
01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:48.679 align:start position:0%
certainly in the neighborhood of 10
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
years before New Hampshire will see a
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
new Men's prison in the meantime we have
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
to maintain the current prison which is
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
costly therefore the governor has
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
proposed three projects at total $12
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
million for the Department of
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
Corrections that will provide much
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
needed basic maintenance at the Men's
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
prison and Conquer uh these projects
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
include HVAC Renovations and boiler
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
Replacements the governor has also
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
requested that $8.5 million be
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the capital budget for
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
the Jeffrey ring uh CTE renovation the
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
governor is a strong supporter of the CT
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
of of CTE schools and ask for your
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
support in this important project this
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
project will include a 30,000 square
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
foot addition that will provide areas to
 
01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:42.679 align:start position:0%
add cosmetology culinary arts fire EMT
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
security and public safety
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
programs finally I wanted to point out
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
the dncr request of $20 million for the
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain tram many of you may
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
remember that in the current budget the
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
legislature appropriated $18 million in
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
cash to dncr sorry sorry dncr to
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
purchase a new tram that money was never
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
spent uh the reason why was the cost of
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
the tram came in well above budget and D
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
dncr went back to the drawing board to
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
come up with a new tram plan uh that is
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
more costeffective and that is where we
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
are now given the useful life of the
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
tram is over 30 years it made far more
 
01:40:24.189 --> 01:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
sense for the state state to use that
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
$18 million for current expenditures of
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
the state and pay for the tram out of
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and the governor's
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 budget the $18 million in cash that
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
was appropriated from the general fund
 
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
will lapse back into the general fund uh
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
on on July 1 of 2025 in its place there
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
is a $20 million ask for the tram in the
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget uh given the legislator's
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the $18 million for
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
the tram the governor wanted to be sure
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the money for this project was
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
placed in her capital budget for your
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
consideration overall the projects the
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
governor has chosen for the capital
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
budget represent a diverse group of
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
departments and projects that share one
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
thing in common they are badly needed we
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
realize that there are numerous other
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
projects that the governor has chosen
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
not to fund that are also important and
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
just as badly needed so we will
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
certainly not be offended if your list
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
is slightly different than ours uh with
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
that I'll be more than happy to open it
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
up for questions thank you thank you sir
 
01:41:27.199 --> 01:41:29.790 align:start position:0%
up for questions thank you thank you sir
any

01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative CIA uh yes uh
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just all I hope you'll take
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
this in with all due respect to the
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
governor as far as the tram line I think
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
it's an important project for tourism
 
01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
and it's got 20 million but I've heard
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost a lot more as much as
 
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
32 million do you does a governor or you
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
have any ideas where we could get those
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds uh I think the 20
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we're in the process now of
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
of looking to see what it will cost and
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
I think what they're trying to do and um
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is that is a
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
difference between just the tram and the
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
towers as well and if we can get it to
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
where we can use the existing Towers the
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
price will come down
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
significantly uh so that's where we are
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
and uh the governor obviously does
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
support the project because if if she
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
didn't it wouldn't be in here um but but
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's the cost I mean if if it's
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
exorbitant costs then we may have to go
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
look look El s um at a different type of
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
project for that because it is a revenue
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
generator it is good for tourism it is
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
good for the North country and all those
 
01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
things the governor is is very
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
supportive of followup Mr chair followup
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
oh yes so you think we could you could
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
get the price down because the towers
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
maybe down to about $20 million you can
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
find some savings or do the postpone the
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
projects for later that is that is our
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
hope and if we can't then the money
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
would have to come and in and if the
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
legislature agreed to fund the project
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
then the money would have to come
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
um either
 
01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
by uh increasing the capital budget or
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
obviously taking it out from from other
 
01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
projects thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank I think it I'm I'm glad it was
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
important to note that the 18 million
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
previously committed to this went back
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
into they did not spend that money they
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
didn't spend that money they're starting
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
off part of the reason why the 20 is
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
here uh anyway yes was it represent L
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair chairman thank you
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
question so is there uh on the issue of
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
the the Tramway um how many bids have
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
you gotten on that on that
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
project I'm I'm not sure about that I
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
believe it was just one I I I I I
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's just one and that's that's
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
why the project came to an immediate
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
halt right there there there's not a lot
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
of companies that
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
Supply this type of equipment and and do
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
this type of job okay thank you any
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
other question Jess representative B
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you said the
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
revenue generator how much revenue will
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
be you can be made to offset what we're
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
spending uh the projections I've seen
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
from uh from from dncr I mean I I
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
believe it's in the in the neighborhood
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
of over a million dollars a
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
year so it's it's uh it's it's it's
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
significant Revenue that they can bring
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
in and then there's and and that's
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's the direct Revenue uh there's
 
01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
also the indirect revenue of it is a a
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
tourism generator it is it it it may not
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
be the sole reason why people come to
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or or go to the North
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
country but it is a it is a reason and
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's certainly one that uh when you
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
think of the iconic right New Hampshire
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
symbols that's one of them thank
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm gon to maybe make a
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
mistake and answer a question that was
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
asked previously about the I know which
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
one you're going to go right ahead I
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
want to put you on I didn't want to put
 
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
you on the spot but go right Ahad about
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
the it appreciate the way you hand that
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
um with that cyber security is is
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
certainly something that is extremely
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
important to the state and extremely
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
important to the governor and uh is
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
something that should be considered the
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
reason why it was wasn't put in here was
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
mly because of other priorities and and
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that cyber security had been
 
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
funded previously both through in the
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
capital budgets uh previously and
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
through some arpa allocations so while
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
those while cyber security is is
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh important to the state and
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
something that should be considered uh
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
she just thought one of the things was
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the cloud services is also an
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
important issue as as now that the state
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
is switching to a cloud service to make
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure we have the proper funding for that
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
so it again it's it's picking a um a
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
project that really hadn't been uh
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
funded in the past for one that had and
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
and that's really what it was nothing
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
nothing more but if you choose to fund
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
cyber security we're certainly not going
 
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
cyber security we're certainly not going
to

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
object thank you for that clarification
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
like I said I didn't want to put you on
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
the spot and but no you you're happy
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative bogert thank you for the
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
the answer okay thank you sir thank you
 
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:29.390 align:start position:0%
the answer okay thank you sir thank you
for

01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
coming folks we've got uh we're a little
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
bit ahead of schedule here so uh let let
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
me just give you a fast
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
rundown what we're in for we're uh we've
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
got an additional $6 M80 th000 worth of
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
extra requests so far but through our
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
laps program representative Jack what do
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
we got 5,2 $67 to good well I have
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
D so you'll you'll notice that we'll get
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
a lot more requests than than people
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
giving up money and that's one we'll
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
we'll get into the tough decisions later
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
on but once again this is just strictly
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
their uh their wish lists and their
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
presentations so thank you very much and
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
we'll see you back here at about just
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
want to uh make sure that judicial
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
branch will not be here at 1:00 so your
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
first agency will be the Department of
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
Education and they should be here about
 
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
1:30 um I had handed out to everybody a
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
copy of a page of an email that
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
basically says that um judicial branch
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
is going to withdraw the project request
 
01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.350 align:start position:0%
is going to withdraw the project request
the

01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
$157,000 uh$ 157 and $950,000 um project
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
um the reason they couldn't be here
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't because of that they had some
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
administrative issues getting people
 
01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:53.350 align:start position:0%
administrative issues getting people
here

01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
but they did want to know that let the
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee know that they were
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
withdrawing that
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
project 157,000 back into the good side
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative bogert uh point of
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
clarification in the
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.669 align:start position:0%
 
$7,950

01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
$7,950
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
request from sorry is that the same fund
 
01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah that's the exact same
 
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
project that's being
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawn thank you very much that's
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
where it gets a little squirrly that's
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
why I was getting him to try to explain
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
that the do
 
01:48:33.239 --> 01:48:34.790 align:start position:0%
that the do
doit

01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
doit
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
has signs off on all these projects
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
right and commits to them but they come
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
out of those departments budgets
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
so so when it looks like as if let's see
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
what six six actual requests only one of
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
doit representative fauler question that
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
you might might be able to answer is
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
that some talk about non-general fond
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
sources for some of these Bond payments
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
can we kind of go over what
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
um what funds I know there's fishing
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
game fund about the highway fund are
 
01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.229 align:start position:0%
game fund about the highway fund are
there

01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
other funds that we draw on that have
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated revenues that
 
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.070 align:start position:0%
dedicated revenues that
U

01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
U
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
and what flexibility is there to those
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
are normally listed most of the time
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
like when we get into uh military side
 
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
those are mostly federal funds but when
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
we get into the do you'll see that some
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the funds come from Highway funds
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
some of them come from Turnpike funds I
 
01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:48.679 align:start position:0%
think we have some uh part of the
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
natural cultural resources from Mr chair
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
if I'm might help with that question so
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at your house bill 25
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
document that I passed out today and if
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
two and that's where you have the
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
projects and then on lines 14 through 18
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
there's a note there that tells you the
 
01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
source of the funds what those other
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
funds are that would fund that project
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
in this case it's very clear it's
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
fishing game for the dancer projects
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
there'll be a similar note for that as
 
01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.550 align:start position:0%
there'll be a similar note for that as
well

01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the agency and if
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
they have dedicated funding to to come
 
01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
forward with liquor fund is another one
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have any projects this year
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
but you've seen them in the past in this
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee where they come in and um ask
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
to do a store renovation and they fund
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
it with liquor funds um Highway fund is
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
a separate section within the house bill
 
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
25 um the dancer has used um excuse me
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
not dancer Environmental Services has
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
used the
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
winaki River Basin um funding that's a
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated group of communities that have
 
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
a um water treatment plant that's run by
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Services they collect
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
revenue from those um agencies to do
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
Capital Pro those communities to do
 
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
capital projects and I believe there's
 
01:51:14.109 --> 01:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
25 I hope that answers the question
 
01:51:20.589 --> 01:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
representative any other questions or
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
concerns Mr representative J thank you
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh just is it unusual back
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
to the judicial branch is it
 
01:51:32.069 --> 01:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
unusual that agency not to request any
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
Capital appropriations of funding they
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
they don't request a lot a lot of what
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
they've requested over the last uh few
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
Capital budgets has been for an ecourt
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
more recently it was the digitization
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
digitization of their records um I'm not
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
sure why they just may not be ready as
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
as a as a branch to move forward with
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
the project and that you watch maybe why
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
they're not asking for this additional
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
funding but I didn't get an exact reason
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
they just said we want to withdraw our
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
request interesting thank you anybody
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
else Mr chair a question I just want to
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
be sure if I heard this right when the
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Gary just said something about the
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
state has just received I think $992
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
million in arpa additional arpa funds no
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
that's what they spent they spent they
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
spent okay fine thank you I misheard
 
01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:24.510 align:start position:0%

Support Department of
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%

Education so I provided three
 
03:29:09.710 --> 03:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
packets the first packet is the
 
03:29:11.070 --> 03:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
presentation from the Department of
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
Education and then there's Al also two
 
03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
additional packets that contain
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
information provided
 
03:29:18.349 --> 03:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
um from the districts from the CT
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
centers with plans budgets and just some
 
03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
background information so that you have
 
03:29:26.910 --> 03:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
that available to look through also here
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
today are representatives from each of
 
03:29:31.229 --> 03:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
the centers so if there's any specific
 
03:29:33.309 --> 03:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
questions um they are available to come
 
03:29:35.150 --> 03:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
up and answer any questions that we
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
might have about the specific
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
projects okay thank you well then I
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
guess I've got the I'll lead off with
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
the first question because we are
 
03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
showing a request for 18 , 518,000 for
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
the Jeffrey ringe CTE renovation and if
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this correctly your new
 
03:29:58.269 --> 03:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
updated request is for $16
 
03:30:01.550 --> 03:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
m46 th000 is that correct that is
 
03:30:03.870 --> 03:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
correct you're going to be invited back
 
03:30:05.710 --> 03:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
here more often if you keep doing things
 
03:30:05.720 --> 03:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
here more often if you keep doing things
like

03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:30:09.150 --> 03:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
this the these things these kind of
 
03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
things make us happy uh so this is for
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and for all the new members here we
 
03:30:16.229 --> 03:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
we go through this
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
every bium we do we have a regular
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
schedule on on schools that we support
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
the CTE project and it's a 75 I believe
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's 7525 match is that correct that's
 
03:30:31.950 --> 03:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
correct so if you could please walk us
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
through do we have the money commitment
 
03:30:39.150 --> 03:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
from Jeffrey ring yet from the town for
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
that project they are going to their
 
03:30:43.389 --> 03:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
vote on March 11th
 
03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay now correct me if I'm wrong uh Mr
 
03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
Shay if they do
 
03:30:53.830 --> 03:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
not vote to pass this then it normally
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
goes to we will still take they will
 
03:30:58.990 --> 03:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
still stay in the same position on our
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
list but we
 
03:31:03.309 --> 03:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
will try and fund it for the next school
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
on the list which I believe is
 
03:31:08.309 --> 03:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
Milford so since it's going to be going
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
to the March meeting you would if this
 
03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
is the desire of the committee to have
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
this CTE project funded you would keep
 
03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
it in the capital budget let the Senate
 
03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
then address it if it
 
03:31:20.349 --> 03:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
fails that's okay thank you that's what
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
I needed to
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
know okay then uh continue There is an
 
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
additional project that uh we wanted to
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
put forth to the committee to consider
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the Milford applied
 
03:31:37.030 --> 03:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
Technology Center with a request of 9.8
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
million that is not included in the
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
03:31:44.910 --> 03:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
okay too bad you couldn't have reduced
 
03:31:47.429 --> 03:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
that original 18 down about another 7
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
million we would have taken care of both
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:55.189 --> 03:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
correct okay and then I take it these
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
are your
 
03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
um this money isn't in either in in
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
lapse requests is it uh Mr Shay they
 
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
they gave us the information for Sugar
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
River Valley and winnisquam what's still
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
there so those two
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
projects um will not are not anticipated
 
03:32:17.790 --> 03:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
to have any lapse funding okay at this
 
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
time those were eventually funded out of
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and have
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
non-aps funds both centers have stated
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
that they anticipate expending all of
 
03:32:28.399 --> 03:32:29.590 align:start position:0%
that they anticipate expending all of
their

03:32:29.590 --> 03:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
funds okay and that's on page three
 
03:32:35.790 --> 03:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
background information on that I just
 
03:32:37.630 --> 03:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
didn't remember going through the
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget for
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
that all right do we have any

03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
up the laps extensions for a moment are
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
you ready to do that yes um you have
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
four the winnisquam actually is outside
 
03:34:06.990 --> 03:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
the purview of this committee at this
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
point because it was funded in House
 
03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 out of the education trust fund
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
correct so that and now we have uh in
 
03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
2021 we have an item for generator
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
installation at Walker building that is
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
not requested for a lapse extension we
 
03:34:27.229 --> 03:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
would assume that's complete and if you
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
would just confirm you don't need that
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
extended that would be good that is
 
03:34:32.349 --> 03:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
correct that project did not move
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward and that was funded with federal
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
funds and the yeah I have that and then
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
the one after that is pre-engineering
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
technology in 20121 item
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
two there's about
 
03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
$199,900 available and those will lapse
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
come 6:30 okay so there is 19,000 in the
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
pre-engineering technology correct right
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's good and then uh we have item 73
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget is the
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
bathrooms uh at the where you previously
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
were located the building yes that is
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
Lan Hall so that that would that would
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
continue that is continuing they expect
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
that project to be completed come August
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
of 25 okay thank
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:35:26.670 --> 03:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
much for
 
03:35:31.870 --> 03:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
you we're running way ahead of schedule
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
is the police standards and training
 
03:35:37.319 --> 03:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
is the police standards and training
here

03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
well that that was that was quick that
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
was a whole lot of people for very short
 
03:36:10.319 --> 03:36:12.630 align:start position:0%
was a whole lot of people for very short
presentation

03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:36:15.990 --> 03:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
huh support noral support since we have
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
a a minute I just wanted to let members
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
know that I added some more paper to
 
03:36:24.429 --> 03:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
your pile just after lunch and one of
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the documents is the tracking sheet that
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
has been typically used in the past by
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
this committee um as you make decisions
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
it kind of helps you kind instead of
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
having to look in the pink uh document
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
or the house bill 25 it gives you a way
 
03:36:44.349 --> 03:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
to track Decisions by this committee um
 
03:36:46.750 --> 03:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
and one of them I didn't change on it
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
yet but you could if you wanted to cross
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
it off is on the second page is judicial
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
branch you basically that's project
 
03:36:58.189 --> 03:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
won't go forward so it stays as zero in
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
the house column and it would be either
 
03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
re-budget it somewhere else for a
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:10.150 --> 03:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
away for those those of you who haven't
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
been here before we use this worksheet
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
when we start after all the
 
03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
presentations are done and we start
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
going into the reg after the public
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
hearing we will start doing this going
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
through here line by line we'll be for
 
03:37:24.670 --> 03:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
instance the uh Department of
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
administrative Services wheel going okay
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
they asked for 1.5 million you notice
 
03:37:33.070 --> 03:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
our column under house says zero we will
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
sit here as a group and decide was that
 
03:37:36.630 --> 03:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
an adequate request the governor
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
approved it is there they they still
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
want it do we want to approve that
 
03:37:43.309 --> 03:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
amount do we want to approve a little
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
bit more or a little bit less so that
 
03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
this will actually be our worksheet and
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
when all of this is finally done then we
 
03:37:53.550 --> 03:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
will and all of Representatives Jack's
 
03:37:56.189 --> 03:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
laps extensions what the laps extensions
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
will do is give us additional money
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
money that's already been budgeted spent
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
and they didn't use it all for projects
 
03:38:07.630 --> 03:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
that we can decide to whether to let it
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
lapse into um the general fund or I'll
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
just pick a number call it 200,000 is
 
03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
left or we can decide to say say hm
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're short uh 200,000 on on this second
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
request for somebody and we can add it
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
to that so although we though this is
 
03:38:26.910 --> 03:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's capital
 
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
budget this being the house Public Works
 
03:38:32.830 --> 03:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
committee we put in our final numbers
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what we will be voting on
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
when we're done it'll go to the Senate
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate will go through the same
 
03:38:42.429 --> 03:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
process so the governor's budget is just
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
a guideline a very wellth thought out
 
03:38:47.950 --> 03:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
guideline but we will have the final say
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
so on that so these are very important
 
03:38:53.070 --> 03:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
worksheets to keep representative alone
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I got a question so
 
03:38:56.830 --> 03:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
we're already looking at $2
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
million less so what we going to do with
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
that money for now will we park it on
 
03:39:03.389 --> 03:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
the Shelf do we sort of just keep in the
 
03:39:05.590 --> 03:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
back of our heads I mean right now yeah
 
03:39:08.349 --> 03:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
well we've once again it was $2 million
 
03:39:10.990 --> 03:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
however if you notice
 
03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
um Das asked for 5 million more their
 
03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
erf program and the department of
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
Information Technology asked for an
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
additional million 180 so we'll have
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
requests on one side we'll
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
have gains on the other side and uh when
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
we get to our final work sessions on all
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
this we as a group are going to decide
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
look what have we got in this column
 
03:39:41.070 --> 03:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
what column is it going to go into so
 
03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
does that money kind of go with the laps
 
03:39:43.950 --> 03:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
money that we're talking about or is
 
03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
that just that no that that money is
 
03:39:50.670 --> 03:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
already in in the budget yeah and it
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
just hasn't been spent yet it hasn't
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
been put into any column now yet so all
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
the laps money will add to that and
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have a different figure going to
 
03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:01.950 align:start position:0%
we'll have a different figure going to
be

03:40:01.950 --> 03:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
fun you haven't done this before have
 
03:40:07.110 --> 03:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
you there fund does not come into this
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
example Mr chairman I'm on uh I'm the
 
03:40:10.990 --> 03:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the budget committee and
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%

well let's let's just let's we'll just
 
03:40:22.110 --> 03:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
be informal from now until uh
 
03:40:25.030 --> 03:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
1:30 yeah if uh someone were new and
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
they were interested in this repurposing
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
from laps money scenario if you go and
 
03:40:32.670 --> 03:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
look at last times House Bill 25 the
 
03:40:35.550 --> 03:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
2023 version after the first part that
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
does all the new appropriation there's a
 
03:40:39.630 --> 03:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
section that does all the repurposing
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
and re and you can look in there as to
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
how the money is lapsed and reallocated
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
so it's basically handled with the with
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment having said that on
 
03:40:58.349 --> 03:40:58.359 align:start position:0%

brought in the lapses during this part
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
of the uh presentation normally we do
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
them all separate but we found out that
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
over the years only two or three people
 
03:41:36.990 --> 03:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
ever know what the heck we're talking
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
about when it comes to lapses so this
 
03:41:41.830 --> 03:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
way we we're having it presented in
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
front of all of us so we know they exist
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
and all your question questions are are
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
very well welcomed and they'll all get
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
answered but the final thing after
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
Marty's committee
 
03:41:57.070 --> 03:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
meets during our first scheduled session
 
03:41:57.080 --> 03:41:58.349 align:start position:0%
meets during our first scheduled session
after

03:41:58.349 --> 03:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
that they will present us a figure that
 
03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
says oh by the way you now have an
 
03:42:08.590 --> 03:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
additional $1.3 million to add into your
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
or add or keep or give to the general
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
funds as a general rule we find a place
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
to end
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
it good just so everyone's clear uh we
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't take any votes at the subcommittee
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
so anyone is free to come sit at your
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
regular place ask questions you know
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%

03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee we have to name specifically
 
03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
name people on to the committee so that
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's official but we was always done it
 
03:42:41.070 --> 03:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:48.120 align:start position:0%

10 our next meeting is scheduled for
 
03:42:57.870 --> 03:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
next Monday it was I scheduled it for
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
Tuesday because I was keeping everything
 
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
on Tuesdays and then we found out it was
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
town meeting day in my ignorance I
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%

General work sessions how long so start
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
having your own little ideas
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative bogur already has a
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
little idea of what he wants to do with
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:27.070 --> 03:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Shay just um in helping the committee
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
kind of think about today's agencies you
 
03:44:31.229 --> 03:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
have the department of safety coming in
 
03:44:31.239 --> 03:44:32.950 align:start position:0%
have the department of safety coming in
at

03:44:32.950 --> 03:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:44:37.630 --> 03:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
two 220 is um you'll see that there's
 
03:44:39.269 --> 03:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
two projects for the Department of
 
03:44:41.790 --> 03:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
Safety uh the automated fuel tax system
 
03:44:43.750 --> 03:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the gun range training
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
facility those
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
and I checked with the the you know you
 
03:44:48.510 --> 03:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
saw the commissioner was here in the
 
03:44:50.670 --> 03:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
hall for a moment and I ran up to him to
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
ask him a question the question was
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
should this be Highway funded bonds or
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
should this be General funded bonds so
 
03:44:58.510 --> 03:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
he's looking into that we believe it
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
should be Highway funded so it may be
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
shifting out of the general fund into
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
the highway Fund in terms of the source
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
of fund
 
03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
request for for both projects yeah yeah
 
03:45:12.630 --> 03:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
um he's he's going to check on that make
 
03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
sure that that's correct but the fuel
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
tax system I would
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's what started the
 
03:45:21.870 --> 03:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
conversation um and then he was looking
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
at the gun range and he was thinking
 
03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
that might also be um Highway
 
03:45:31.630 --> 03:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
funded at least by to some extent so
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
just so the committee is kind of aware
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
of that when the presentation comes in
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
and he starts to talk about Highway fund
 
03:45:40.269 --> 03:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
general fund that's where that that may
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
be coming from and you may want to um
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
further prod and and ask questions
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
related to that just to make sure it's
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%

govern agency of some sort and I'm kind
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
of confused why two
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
different accreditations have to happen
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%

03:56:52.269 --> 03:56:52.279 align:start position:0%
yes please and why is that if it's a
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
Corrections there's not much difference
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
between corre I mean yes there's
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
differences but uh you still have
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
prisoners at state level and they're
 
03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
prisoners at the county level why would
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
there be a need for two different types
 
03:57:11.550 --> 03:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
of uh accreditation for

but you could walk down the hallways you
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
could walk right into the lecture hall
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
where the recruits are currently at
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%

now okay there is a camera there's a few
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
cameras in the building but they're not
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to stop somebody from walking in
 
03:58:14.429 --> 03:58:14.439 align:start position:0%
and just going so this includes both
 
03:58:14.439 --> 03:58:15.790 align:start position:0%
and just going so this includes both
physical

03:58:15.790 --> 03:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
physical
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%

03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
you repres representative Lewis thank
 
03:58:29.389 --> 03:58:29.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh have there been
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
issues as to why this has come come
 
03:58:33.510 --> 03:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
about what that you you you guys wanted
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
to your department wanted to address
 
03:58:36.269 --> 03:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
this at this
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question my name
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
is ma Schultz I'm the administrator in
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
charge of our Bureau of support services
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
so I think this is something that police
 
03:58:52.110 --> 03:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
standards and training uh Administration
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
has wanted to do is to secure the
 
03:58:57.070 --> 03:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
entrance for quite a few years uh we
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
have had several instances over the
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
years where we've had people who are
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
unhoused who would just show up in our
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
lobby and be laying in our lobby or we
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
would have to get medical attention for
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
them that we weren't aware they were
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
there so I think these type of
 
03:59:15.229 --> 03:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
instances uh certainly caused Great
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
concern to for protection of not just
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
our staff but of all the visitors and
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
other police agencies that are attending
 
03:59:24.910 --> 03:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
training that may be unarmed and unaware
 
03:59:26.950 --> 03:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
of who might be in the building because
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
we can't control the physical barriers
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
in the hallways and things you could
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
literally walk in our front lobby go up
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
the stairs and go to the dorm rooms for
 
03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
the recruits you could go to any of the
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
lecture halls and training it just was
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
not designed for those physical barrier
 
03:59:42.520 --> 03:59:45.429 align:start position:0%
not designed for those physical barrier
impediments

03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
impediments
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr just just just
 
03:59:50.070 --> 03:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
for your information I I don't think I I
 
03:59:52.110 --> 03:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
think what you asked was did anything
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
just trigger this and I believe he said
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
nothing just trigger this but this has
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
been in past budget requests for at
 
04:00:03.630 --> 04:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
least the last two or four years uh just
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get approved that's all so they
 
04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
have requested this before any other
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative fauler yes
 
04:00:11.670 --> 04:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I know this isn't part of your
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
request but you mentioned the uh firing
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
range at your headquarters is
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
that who who is that available to is it
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
all police officers or just those in
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
training or uh how is that
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
managed So currently any and all police
 
04:00:31.229 --> 04:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
officers use that range to qualify to
 
04:00:32.910 --> 04:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
complete the academy also for our
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
inservice program they have to come back
 
04:00:36.670 --> 04:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
and redo their inservice for instructor
 
04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
CS um if there is a request for that
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
range that would go if there's somebody
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
because of bad weather and they need to
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
go out and qualify their officers they
 
04:00:46.229 --> 04:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
have to submit the request through the
 
04:00:48.110 --> 04:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
director and if it's available he will
 
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
make it available for them if could
 
04:00:52.349 --> 04:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
assist most of the agencies have their
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
own ranges we do it for our
 
04:00:59.030 --> 04:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
training thank you one final question
 
04:01:01.110 --> 04:01:01.120 align:start position:0%

asked him about uh that program being
 
04:01:19.710 --> 04:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
reinstituted and I was told it was I
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
just was wondering how many how many
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%

full-time if all the classes fill the
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
part-time uh currently is at 18 but that
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
one can go up to 20

numbers of if you're mean exact well
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
graduates um currently right now our
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
academies will take 64 for three
 
04:06:48.750 --> 04:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
sessions we were doing
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman so on the on this on this
 
04:07:01.950 --> 04:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
track uh are sounds like we're we're
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
graduating recruits for for cops on the
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the state level and in the uh in the
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh prisons I mean sounds like this
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
number should be going up we should we
 
04:07:14.910 --> 04:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
should should the Staffing level should
 
04:07:14.920 --> 04:07:15.790 align:start position:0%
should should the Staffing level should
be

04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
better with with the amount of with just
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the way of using the
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
facility yes uh if the classes fill um
 
04:07:26.349 --> 04:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the beginning of the classes
 
04:07:28.030 --> 04:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there is an attrition rate
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
on some of the classes what's the
 
04:07:34.149 --> 04:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
graduation I follow up thank you thank
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
you graduation rate 90% or better uh I
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
would say it's less than that um our
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
last class we only had 39 recruits
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
attend out of 50 and that was in
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
December this class we started with 64
 
04:07:48.109 --> 04:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're currently at 60 to graduate but
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're only halfway through gotcha
 
04:07:54.349 --> 04:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions saying none gentlemen thank
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
presentation we have Department of
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
Safety scheduled at 2:20 if they are
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I just want to correct I
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
suggested to the committee earlier that
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
when they came up we'd talk about
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
Highway funds versus General funds
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
correct um in talking with the
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner and his business
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
administrator the reason that the
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
general funds are being used it has to
 
04:08:32.590 --> 04:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
do with the health of the highway fund
 
04:08:35.309 --> 04:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
so there's not enough money to do
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
projected to do the bonding that would
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
be required for these projects so the
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation is correct
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's my error steering you the wrong
 
04:08:46.269 --> 04:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
way thank you for that information and
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
not good news to hear about the highway
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%

04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
collect the highway Fund in summary the
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampton that is an urgent need of
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
significant upgrades currently the
 
04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
existing training building is under
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
sized and relying on generator power
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
which limits it its
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
functionality Additionally the facility
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
lacks restrooms and running water making
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
it difficult to utilize the range year
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
round these limitations hinder
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the training programs
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
and restrict its overall utility for law
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and other agencies
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
through building a properly sized
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
training facility that meets the needs
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire State Police and other
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
agencies connecting the facility to
 
04:12:55.229 --> 04:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities eliminating the need
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
for generator power want to install
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
running water and restroom facilities
 
04:13:02.189 --> 04:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
providing basic amenities that are
 
04:13:03.710 --> 04:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
essential both for operating
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and comfort Personnel um
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
expanding the range area to accommodate
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
a broader range of training scenarios
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
and provide greater opportun for skill
 
04:13:17.550 --> 04:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
development and these improvements could
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
benefit other benefit other state
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
agencies as well including kushion game
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
Municipal police departments such as
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
those in New Hampton and more functional
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
and accessible training facilities would
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
enhanced training capabilities across
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies promoting safety
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
efficiency and Inter agency
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
cooperation so before I move on to our
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
requested um our next requested um
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
Capital project do you have questions
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
about these
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
two yes I believe we do representative
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman and I
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
apologize Amy what is your last name
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
Newbery Newbery I apologize Miss
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
Newberry thank you for your testimony
 
04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you taking my question
 
04:14:04.990 --> 04:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
um prior to your testimony we heard from
 
04:14:07.109 --> 04:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
two individuals representing the police
 
04:14:09.630 --> 04:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council regarding
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
some of their projects and and their
 
04:14:13.870 --> 04:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
facility concerns and they have a gun
 
04:14:15.870 --> 04:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
range at their particular facility that
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
is available upon request and I'm just
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um curious to know what prevents the
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
State Police from coordinating with the
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
police standards training facility to
 
04:14:29.950 --> 04:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
Facility I think that our needs are go
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
beyond what they can provide there
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's an indoor range um we're
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
generally shooting twice a year we also
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
do use of force defensive tactics we're
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
shooting rifles so I believe that um I
 
04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that that that could meet
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
our needs plus our plus the amount of
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
Troopers that were rotating through
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
there we generally need to be outside
 
04:14:59.309 --> 04:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
too to incorporate some of the um
 
04:15:01.389 --> 04:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
vehicle stops and just different
 
04:15:04.750 --> 04:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios that they do I appreciate the
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
Canda thank you no thank
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to ask a question
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
following up on that I know that the uh
 
04:15:14.349 --> 04:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
Governor Cog G is been having meetings
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
and I know this was a topic of one of
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
the things um there are obviously
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
numerous gun ranges run by various
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
police and other departments where would
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
where do you rate this your your
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety one I in overall
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
are you able to accommodate more and
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
more uh other departments if we were to
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
to get you this money and and move it
 
04:15:39.630 --> 04:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
forward or would you say you're one of
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
the smaller less well no that's used
 
04:15:42.359 --> 04:15:43.429 align:start position:0%
the smaller less well no that's used
like

04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question and I think you
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
know anytime you look at an investment
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
you have to look if there's 365 days in
 
04:15:51.070 --> 04:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
the year um how many days are we using
 
04:15:53.149 --> 04:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
it and then you know could it be
 
04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
expanded to allow others to use it I
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
think you know the answer is yes we
 
04:15:59.309 --> 04:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
could definitely look at that but again
 
04:16:01.469 --> 04:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
we cycle a lot through there's a lot of
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
training that gets done there and um so
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for efficiency I think
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is definitely a a question to ask
 
04:16:11.030 --> 04:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I can bring that up in our our coach
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
if we're investing in this are there
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
others that might want to be able to use
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
it like Amy said there are other state
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
agencies state law enforcement agencies
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
that um go through the same Police
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
Academy um we we we're always um willing
 
04:16:25.389 --> 04:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
to share our resources we're one state
 
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I think the answer is yes thank you
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
very much uh representative rockmore you
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
had a question earlier did it get
 
04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
answered during that presentation or not
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
it did thank you it did okay thank you
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
repres representative fauler I'm sorry
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative kazinski thank you I'm so
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
used to see
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
down there with this is an outdoor range
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
with rifles how how is this 100 yard
 
04:16:52.510 --> 04:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
range or 200 yards or I think right now
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
the trying to go back the last time we
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
were at 50 100 we're trying to go back
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
too to expand it to at least that for
 
04:17:01.239 --> 04:17:03.229 align:start position:0%
too to expand it to at least that for
the

04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:03.239 --> 04:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
the
rifles

04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
rifles
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
okay um on this building what what type
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
of a building is this going to be like a
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
garage or is it this is B I mean we what
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
we're in now sir is a basic slab you
 
04:17:17.359 --> 04:17:18.189 align:start position:0%
we're in now sir is a basic slab you
know

04:17:18.189 --> 04:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
t111 asphalt roof that's had mold um it
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:17:27.229 --> 04:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
there I go back as far as I can remember
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
there's never been any enhancement to it
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
we've had a porta party there at times
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's no running water um it's it's
 
04:17:37.469 --> 04:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
definitely a life end yeah I got that
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
picture there but I'm asking what what
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
the new building would be like because
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's I'm looking at the request here and
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to Envision that I I think
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
like everything we do we try to be
 
04:17:50.429 --> 04:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
pretty basic not to overbuild it so if
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the dimensions I think
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
it will meet our needs with um I mean if
 
04:17:57.630 --> 04:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
you're looking for the construction
 
04:18:02.109 --> 04:18:02.119 align:start position:0%
materials is is that you asking I was
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
kind of concerned what kind of building
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
is because I I have a large
 
04:18:08.590 --> 04:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
garage is this a garage type building I
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
would say so
 
04:18:12.030 --> 04:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think it's a Morton
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
Building a steel but we're looking at a
 
04:18:18.990 --> 04:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
23x 20 building you know just basic
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
construction well that's the one you
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
have now right right so we're looking at
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:33.109 --> 04:18:33.119 align:start position:0%
feet two
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
classrooms dedicated office weapons
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:47.229 --> 04:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative jur thank you
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh so this building was originally
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
conceived when and and was it just a
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
place to go and and and begin you know
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
just target practice or something and
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
then a building was installed
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
and how did this get to this point I
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
guess is my first question I can tell
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
you how I want to go back
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
I remember when it was built I think it
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
was some Troopers that volunteered they
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
poured a slab they framed it put a roof
 
04:19:23.189 --> 04:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
on it basic construction a a steel door
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was it and it's been there ever
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
since and we've shot there since as long
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
as I can remember to the point now where
 
04:19:33.389 --> 04:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
you know we had U limited electricity
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
and uh yes so that's just that that's
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
just the way it was I want to say this
 
04:19:44.550 --> 04:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
goes back to early early 90s if I can
 
04:19:47.229 --> 04:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
remember maybe earlier than that maybe
 
04:19:50.349 --> 04:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
late 80s but it's been
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
there quick followup Mr chairman real
 
04:19:55.149 --> 04:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
quick uh very quick would are you going
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
to have simulators there as well and uh
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
you know robotics no I think no we don't
 
04:20:03.070 --> 04:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
that that's not Incorporated in this I
 
04:20:05.469 --> 04:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
mean it's basic you know there might be
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
some you know uh uh scenarios for moving
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
targets but it's it's it's very very
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
basic we're trying to get the utilities
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
in there number one it's a nice location
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's right off the highway it's worked
 
04:20:19.950 --> 04:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
well for us it's functional if we get
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
utilities we get the water in there we
 
04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
get we're not trying to overbuild this
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
so for the amount of Troopers that you
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
bring in at one time for training I
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
think this size is sufficient as long as
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's um the amenities running water
 
04:20:34.269 --> 04:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
and a restroom connectivity so they can
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
have videos do some interactive training
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
because it's not just Firearms it's
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
handcuffing it's use of force it's
 
04:20:44.429 --> 04:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
deescalation car stops uh things like
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
that that will happen right
 
04:20:50.830 --> 04:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
there I have uh I I have one big big
 
04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
pertinent question here I'm hoping I get
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
the right answer in both the uh our
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
worksheet and the governor's book we've
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
got a request for $2.3 million for this
 
04:21:04.830 --> 04:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
gun range facility and in your
 
04:21:08.469 --> 04:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
page page five says
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
1.59 million thank you for that question
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
so that's an error in the PowerPoint but
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
what happened is originally that the 1.5
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
is what we put in for following that
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
after we met with public works and did
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
that initial assessment of the land and
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to build the electric and
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
the water um Public Works came back to
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
us and said with your request that can't
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
happen so then this is where the project
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
came in at it was the
 
04:21:41.309 --> 04:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
2.3 ah that wasn't the answer I was
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
really looking for
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
I was hoping I was thinking that 1.5
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
million was looking pretty good for a
 
04:21:48.359 --> 04:21:49.229 align:start position:0%
million was looking pretty good for a
gun

04:21:49.229 --> 04:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
gun
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
range represent voyd thank you
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quin thank you for taking
 
04:21:53.800 --> 04:21:55.109 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quin thank you for taking
my

04:21:55.109 --> 04:21:55.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
question is it fair to say that this
 
04:21:59.309 --> 04:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
facility with with the Troopers and
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
other police officers using the facility
 
04:22:03.389 --> 04:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
that guns and Munitions are going to be
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
carried in and carried out that there's
 
04:22:07.389 --> 04:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
not going to be a secure space on that
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
location where Munitions and weapons are
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to remain that's correct sir thank
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
representative alone thank you Mr
 
04:22:17.070 --> 04:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
question this is the only gun range
 
04:22:21.189 --> 04:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's being used by state troopers
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
buer thank you Mr
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
chairman So currently the the gun range
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
as it is has just about a zero impact on
 
04:22:39.800 --> 04:22:40.710 align:start position:0%
as it is has just about a zero impact on
your

04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
budget for upkeep or anything like that
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
versus now with the admin
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
of whatever it
 
04:22:55.389 --> 04:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
was 2.3 million then it's going to
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
become a yearly addition to the budget
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
for upkeep electric internet service and
 
04:23:06.030 --> 04:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
and and all the associated effects is it
 
04:23:08.830 --> 04:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
also going to add headcount to the
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
training to hire a training person to to
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
maintain it or how we all
 
04:23:20.710 --> 04:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
have coverage of security for who's
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
using it in its upgraded ability versus
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
now you know that that's a good question
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'll let I'll jump in before Amy can
 
04:23:30.429 --> 04:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
touch on the um utilities but
 
04:23:31.990 --> 04:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
essentially we maintain that now
 
04:23:34.109 --> 04:23:34.119 align:start position:0%
ourselves with our own staff it won't
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
require hiring any additional training
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
Troopers I mean the Troopers that we
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
have that use that range today to do the
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
training will use a new range in the
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
future if if one gets approved um I
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
think Amy can speak to you know what the
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
charges might be the additional costs
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's electricity or sewer and
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
water I'm sure it'll be a well and
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
septic and um but Amy do you want to
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
speak to the I don't think it's
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
significant yeah so um I guess I would
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
speak more to your first question about
 
04:24:06.030 --> 04:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
that it's that today it's there isn't
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
really a cost I would say that's um the
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
fac our facility team that I oversee is
 
04:24:15.550 --> 04:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
at the range often dealing with molds
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
and addressing the generator that often
 
04:24:20.910 --> 04:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't work so I would say that there
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
is a lot of funding going into just
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
maintaining something that is not so
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
functional today so we we put a great
 
04:24:29.950 --> 04:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
deal of funding into it just to make
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
like take care of the mold over the last
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
year followup question at this point
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what your annual call
 
04:24:40.349 --> 04:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
Star for upkeeping of this property at
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
um what we put into it to address the
 
04:24:53.229 --> 04:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
mold last year I can't recall
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I can't recall the exact amount last
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
year I know that was the first time we
 
04:25:00.030 --> 04:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
had to address kind of a larger quantity
 
04:25:03.109 --> 04:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
like a larger issue with the
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
mold could I just add sir I think just
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
to put some context to this if you look
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire State Police their
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the state if you
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
how important training has been to keep
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
them you know as trained keep them
 
04:25:26.349 --> 04:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
current if you look at the liability
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
that the state can face if someone's
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
improperly trained to look at just basic
 
04:25:30.600 --> 04:25:31.910 align:start position:0%
improperly trained to look at just basic
a

04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
functional place for them to go train
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
shoot clean their weapons get in and get
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
out of there and spend time and be able
 
04:25:41.960 --> 04:25:42.870 align:start position:0%
out of there and spend time and be able
to

04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:25:46.830 --> 04:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
um use a use a restroom if they need to
 
04:25:49.149 --> 04:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
I think that in the long run it's
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
important for the state to have an
 
04:25:53.910 --> 04:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
adequate training facility for the
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
largest Department in the state who have
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
immense responsibility I think it's long
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
overdue one followup yes uh I understand
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
that and I respect the uh fact that
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the safety but we just
 
04:26:13.870 --> 04:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
heard we had a 28 Lane gun range and
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
Training Facility uh that they're
 
04:26:21.870 --> 04:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
requesting funds for and uh I'm just
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
curious of how many different gun ranges
 
04:26:27.389 --> 04:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
we need for law enforcement across the
 
04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
state as we continually taking scarce
 
04:26:35.590 --> 04:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
resources and trying to fund and keep it
 
04:26:39.109 --> 04:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
as safe as we can so that our Public
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
Service people are properly trained
 
04:26:46.510 --> 04:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
that that is that is absolutely a very
 
04:26:48.109 --> 04:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
fair question a good question and I
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
think the best way for me to answer it
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the capacity of what
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
is at the police standards and training
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
and what their mission and goal is
 
04:26:58.910 --> 04:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're training new recruits they're in
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
a controlled environment standing in a
 
04:27:05.950 --> 04:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
range and shooting at targets down range
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability there to move
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to shoot on
 
04:27:10.990 --> 04:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
the move they don't have the ability
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
there to increase their blood pressure
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
to to run to to do different types of
 
04:27:19.109 --> 04:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
scenarios and the Firearms Constructors
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
could speak better but by the when you
 
04:27:23.550 --> 04:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
get to that range you're not just
 
04:27:27.070 --> 04:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
standing there um shooting at uh
 
04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
stationary targets there's more to it
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then when you add the handcuffing
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
the vehicle stops um adding stress to it
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know having the
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
ability to to do more I mean quite you
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
know the range at the police academy is
 
04:27:43.870 --> 04:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
critical to training those new recruits
 
04:27:47.550 --> 04:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
but this this offers more for the more
 
04:27:50.349 --> 04:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
advanced um state trooper and police
 
04:27:50.359 --> 04:27:52.349 align:start position:0%
advanced um state trooper and police
officer

04:27:52.349 --> 04:27:52.359 align:start position:0%

04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
sir thank you seeing no further
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions we'd like to go ahead and move
 
04:28:01.950 --> 04:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
please so this is on page Pages 9
 
04:28:10.030 --> 04:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
through 11 and it is the um plate
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
production equipment modernization so
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
over the last 60 years the process of

manufacturing New Hampshire license
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
plates have remained virtually unchanged
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
today over 1.6 million registered
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the state um need for
 
04:28:29.790 --> 04:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
modernization is more pressing than ever
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
license plates are a fundamental part of
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
a vehicle registration required through

RSA 261 subsection 40 and RSA 261
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%

04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
used to produce them is becoming
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult to maintain
 
04:28:49.469 --> 04:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire's plates are
 
04:28:52.269 --> 04:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
made from aluminum with Graphics applied

over two decades without a structured

read the American Association of Motor
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
Vehicles administrators recommends
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
replacing plates every 10 years to
 
04:29:49.630 --> 04:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
ensure visibility and compliance with
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
modern safety standards a transition to
 
04:29:54.830 --> 04:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
a modernized production process would
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
allow for a more durable product that
 
04:30:00.309 --> 04:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
retains its quality over
 
04:30:02.830 --> 04:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
time upgrading licensed plate
 
04:30:04.750 --> 04:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing equipment would provide
 
04:30:07.870 --> 04:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
several benefits first modern technology
 
04:30:10.349 --> 04:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
would increase production capacity and
 
04:30:12.990 --> 04:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
reduce downtime in ensuring a steady
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
supply of plates for New Hampshire
 
04:30:17.670 --> 04:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
residents second enhanced security
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
features such as digital watermarks
 
04:30:20.159 --> 04:30:21.710 align:start position:0%
features such as digital watermarks
improved

04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
improved
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
reflectivity and tamper resistant
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
elements would make it more difficult
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
for plates to be counterfeited or
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
altered and third the adoption of a more
 
04:30:33.109 --> 04:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
sustainable manufacturing process would
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
reduce waste lower energy consumption
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
and align with environmentally
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
responsible practices and we're bringing
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
this in front of you today because our
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
concern is that the equipment will not
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
make it through the bium um to the next
 
04:30:51.790 --> 04:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
Capital project so you can also see on
 
04:30:55.389 --> 04:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
page 10 it's a um a few data points here
 
04:30:58.950 --> 04:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
with um 600,000 plates produced each
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
year 91 different plate types and the
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
steps in the process is they're 12 um
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
some of these photos you can see um like
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
just on page nine you can see the um the
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
process those red hanging things from
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
the ceiling that's that's the oven so it
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
takes an hour for plates to go through
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
this oven and then the amount of gas
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
that it takes to run the oven um I went
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Corrections to
 
04:31:31.710 --> 04:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
watch this process a couple weeks ago
 
04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
and the equipment was down so it wasn't
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
able to actually watch it work um and it
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
had been down um for a week and a half
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't get a part um so
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
they have gone to other states to find
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
parts they've gone to eBay to find parts
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
and they were waiting for a part for a
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
machine called the Cincinnati and that's
 
04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
the um machine that actually makes
 
04:31:58.510 --> 04:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
plates for the legislature um but that
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
machine is almost a hundred years old um
 
04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
so there are as far as like an inventory
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
they um we have about three months of
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
plates on hand so being down for a week
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
and a half is it's a long time and
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's not um that's not uncommon so
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
there are many times over the past
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
several months that a week and a half
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
has happened so it's just it's very
 
04:32:28.590 --> 04:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
concerning and we wanted to put it on
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
your radar that we're not not confident
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
that this is going to make it to the
 
04:32:32.840 --> 04:32:36.670 align:start position:0%
that this is going to make it to the
next

04:32:36.670 --> 04:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
no questions move on to the lapses
 
04:32:45.389 --> 04:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
please well I'm sorry representative
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
jurus thank you Mr chairman uh so we're
 
04:32:53.870 --> 04:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
not am I clear with your with your
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
presentation we just don't know how long
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
or how much further we can
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
go with this equipment the stamping
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
machine I I think it's worse than that I
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
think we're bringing this in
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
because of the recent um the recent
 
04:33:13.709 --> 04:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
amount of times that it's been down and
 
04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that every year it gets a
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
little older and when they've got
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
equipment that they can't find
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
replacement pots for we just want to
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're well aware of the
 
04:33:24.750 --> 04:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
current status of this equipment that's
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
so important quick followup where would
 
04:33:27.119 --> 04:33:28.789 align:start position:0%
so important quick followup where would
we

04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
go would we would we subcontract it how
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
would we an emergency would we go to
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
different state and say can you make our
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
plates can you make a do a run of a th
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
5,000 plates you mean if we if we had to
 
04:33:41.520 --> 04:33:42.869 align:start position:0%
5,000 plates you mean if we if we had to
like

04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
have a plan B if this didn't go well
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
that's why I think what we want to do is
 
04:33:48.670 --> 04:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll let Amy speak to it we're
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
making this proposal so that we can look
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
towards the most efficient and um cost
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
effective solution for the future of the
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire for these plates
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
having understanding that this equipment
 
04:34:04.750 --> 04:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
is that old and in the you know recent
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
weeks it's been inoperable it's been
 
04:34:09.510 --> 04:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
down samie do you want to I'm I can't
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
answer your question I'm not sure if you
 
04:34:13.349 --> 04:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
can subc contract New Hampshire license
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
plates out to other states okay thank
 
04:34:18.279 --> 04:34:20.070 align:start position:0%
plates out to other states okay thank
you

04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
fauler kazinski I'm sorry kazinski I
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
keep look I keep looking right through
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
you uh is the plan to keep the
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections doing this job
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
or is someone else going to be doing
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
this if you get new Machinery I think I
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
think what we have discussed is if this
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
if funds are appropriated we go and look
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
out towards and deliver what is the best
 
04:34:48.109 --> 04:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
and most efficient way to make these
 
04:34:50.750 --> 04:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
plates whether it's inside the prisoner
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
outside follow up because I guess these
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
these guys aren't really going anywhere
 
04:34:57.869 --> 04:34:57.879 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a captive audience but in
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
other words you're talking about maybe
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
um hiring new personnel and new
 
04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
buildings and such to do this then
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
addition that's a great question we've
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
talked about that internally and I don't
 
04:35:11.070 --> 04:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think you can get those the
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
answers to questions until you look and
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
see what this new equipment can do and
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
how much um how much labor is involved
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
in it how much can be automated I mean
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
right now we know it's a 12-step process
 
04:35:24.189 --> 04:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
we know how many employees are there
 
04:35:26.590 --> 04:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
from getting the aluminum rolled onto
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
the first machine getting the sheathing
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
overlaid taking the plate out there
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
handing it to someone else that's doing
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
the levers and stamping it that person
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
hands it to two other inmates that put
 
04:35:40.029 --> 04:35:40.039 align:start position:0%
it on another machine and squeeze the
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
ink on it and if it's a green plate it's
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
green if it's red that goes through a
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
machine then it goes to the oven we
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
haven't even discussed the equipment
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
that does the stickers so when you look
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
at that that's also really so I guess I
 
04:35:56.349 --> 04:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
can't answer that but I think that
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I think it's it would be in
 
04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
everyone's best interest to look and see
 
04:36:02.590 --> 04:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
like what is the best way to do this
 
04:36:02.600 --> 04:36:03.670 align:start position:0%
like what is the best way to do this
moving

04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
moving
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
forward repres of Cl okay thank you Mr
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
chairman h a question on page 10 at the
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
top uh under modernization of plate
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
production equipment it says 600,000
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
plates produced per produced each year
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
is this two of the same plate for each
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle no that's 600 to Total 600,000
 
04:36:27.150 --> 04:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
give a take roughly okay so follow up Mr
 
04:36:29.629 --> 04:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
chairman so it's not 1.2 is this for
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
like motorcycles include motorcycles but
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that's everything that's that's
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's the best number they can give me
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
all in all right okay all right and uh
 
04:36:40.709 --> 04:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
follow up so probably if for some reason
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get a debate here
 
04:36:43.869 --> 04:36:43.879 align:start position:0%
because other committees have debated
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
this about if we went to just one plate
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
per motor vehicle would that obviously
 
04:36:51.551 --> 04:36:51.561 align:start position:0%
number be cut right it would all right
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay you don't you can't give an
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
estimate how much you know I don't if
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
you thought about this question before
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
half of what you got right now you think
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
about half okay that's I just want to be
 
04:37:01.990 --> 04:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
Comm representative below thank you Mr
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thanks Tak the question so
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
how'd you get to this 2.3 million figure
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
up I'm going to build a second question
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
question in which is were there
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
Alternatives so what are we looking at
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
for equipment thank you so we had
 
04:37:21.390 --> 04:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
originally applied for um uh
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
Congressional delegated spending for
 
04:37:26.551 --> 04:37:26.561 align:start position:0%
this project um so through that process
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
we had done we had put at some inquiries
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
to get a price so um in doing that I
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
used um the information we had gathered
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
when we did that
 
04:37:37.869 --> 04:37:37.879 align:start position:0%
application to put this
 
04:37:37.879 --> 04:37:39.709 align:start position:0%
application to put this
forward

04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
followup so I'm there just just confused
 
04:37:44.910 --> 04:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
so I mean we talking about like you know
 
04:37:48.990 --> 04:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
A Smith Press I mean just do you have
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
the equipment in mind that's basically
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for and also were there
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
are alternatives too so there were
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
um I'm going off of what somebody else
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
had did for research so I'm sorry if I'm
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
I can only give you what I recall from
 
04:38:07.869 --> 04:38:07.879 align:start position:0%
the application but there were um the
 
04:38:10.349 --> 04:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
DNB had reached out to two vendors who
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
specialize in this
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
um equipment in this process and um they
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
got information from those two to
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
complete the application for this
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
funding which ultimately was denied but
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
um in that they were able to get an
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
estimate for what um with those vendors
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
recommend and what other states are
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
doing um so that's how we came up with
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
this number as the best
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
estimate thank
 
04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
you representative fuler I'm going to
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
call you representative kazinski just to
 
04:38:43.070 --> 04:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
be fair balance it out thank you Mr
 
04:38:45.789 --> 04:38:45.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um not so much a question I
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh when we visited the women's prison I
 
04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
think that one of the things that was
 
04:38:55.629 --> 04:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
pointed out to us is that the uh giving
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the inmates a useful job was important
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
as part of
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
their you know their Rehabilitation or
 
04:39:06.150 --> 04:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
at least uh you know maintenance of
 
04:39:11.789 --> 04:39:11.799 align:start position:0%
the of a prisoner population and
 
04:39:13.629 --> 04:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
do you have a this with how many how
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
many people are actually involved in
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
this uh who work on the plates at the
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
prison and how how important is that as
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
part of their
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
General I I I would defer to
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks to you know comment
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
on how important it is to them but just
 
04:39:30.910 --> 04:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
I was there I would say a month ago and
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
it was operational so I'm going to go
 
04:39:37.150 --> 04:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
recall at least eight that I saw had
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
some function in it but again like I
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
said until you look to see what the new
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
equipment does you may not need it may
 
04:39:54.190 --> 04:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
be one process as opposed to multiple
 
04:39:56.110 --> 04:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
quick fall I point out when I first
 
04:39:57.868 --> 04:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
learned the drive they replace the
 
04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
plates every year because they would
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
rust out they're made out of steel so
 
04:40:03.270 --> 04:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
soly the number of plates I used to
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
now okay we're getting pressed for time
 
04:40:12.510 --> 04:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
would you like to move on to your your
 
04:40:16.310 --> 04:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh laps approvals please yes so that is
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
page 10 of your
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint so the first one is the DMV
 
04:40:21.760 --> 04:40:23.350 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint so the first one is the DMV
online

04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
portal so that one was a project aimed
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
to enhance customer service by
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
leveraging technology to reduce weight
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
times at the DMB substations so several
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives here have been successfully
 
04:40:38.830 --> 04:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
completed including expanding online
 
04:40:41.310 --> 04:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
services to allow requests for duplicate
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and non-d Driver IDs

said I make the right and the quick left
just

04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
before no quick left is the dot shed you
 
04:45:18.990 --> 04:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
go down like a tenth of a mile two10
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
from M take a left it's really it's
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
quiet Road it's quiet spot gotcha and
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
again circling back do you know how many
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
acres the property is I want to say
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
we've looked at
 
04:45:32.350 --> 04:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
it it it goes I want to say less than
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
three give or
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
take less than three I think
 
04:45:40.510 --> 04:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's you're in that ballpark that's fair
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
I don't mean put you on spot just trying
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
to Ballpark it it's narrow gotcha and I
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
think we can go beyond where the
 
04:45:51.310 --> 04:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
existing building and Generator are so
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%

down okay thank you commissioner I

04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
Rochester to peas to continue to support
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
industry thank you and I take it we have
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
one other maybe request yeah uh as I
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
shared on slide two which included our
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
original request we had included 1.2
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
million in it related
 
04:51:35.628 --> 04:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
Capital what following the governor's
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
budget we'd like to ask for additional
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
consideration for 800,000 specifically
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
for some it related Capital
 
04:51:47.390 --> 04:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
expenses critical infrastructure to
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
support our technology needs across the
 
04:51:51.200 --> 04:51:59.670 align:start position:0%
support our technology needs across the
seven

04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
colleges thank you
 
04:52:03.440 --> 04:52:04.948 align:start position:0%
colleges thank you
sir

04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
um I oh I'm sorry I I just noticed now
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
this is this is your sixe plan on on the
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
second page yes I'm sorry I I probably
 
04:52:18.430 --> 04:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
move more quickly to the uh Governor's
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
budget rather than the six-year plan
 
04:52:24.670 --> 04:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances that we know
 
04:52:24.680 --> 04:52:26.430 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances that we know
you're

04:52:26.430 --> 04:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
facing thank you so we do have the
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
request for the 700,000 and a additional
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
request for 800,000 for
 
04:52:34.760 --> 04:52:37.150 align:start position:0%
request for 800,000 for
it

04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
um like I said very short list can we
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
move on to your lap lapse extensions
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
then sir uh we we can if you'll allow
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
one additional comment on the uh Great
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
Bay Welding the request is 700 our
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
estimate for the project is actually 400
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
1.4 million we're anticipating absorbing
 
04:53:02.670 --> 04:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
half of that expense uh but wanted to
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
request some support if it's available I
 
04:53:08.430 --> 04:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
just want to add that as a detail thank
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
Moore yes we have a question
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative Brown yeah just I just
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm I'm straight here
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
because on the second page of their
 
04:53:23.070 --> 04:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
request there before the six-year plan
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned they show 1.2 million
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
for 26 27 I thought there was some
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about 800,000 did I miss I
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm not confused
 
04:53:35.070 --> 04:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
on this we we we've narrowed the request
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
down we respectful of the pressures that
 
04:53:40.708 --> 04:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
this committee and the legislature are
 
04:53:44.548 --> 04:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
facing in this budget process so we
 
04:53:46.750 --> 04:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
focused on some core priorities for
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
support follow up can you just give me a
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
little bit of a a little bit of detail
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
on what the
 
04:54:01.390 --> 04:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you as you can see on slide
 
04:54:07.708 --> 04:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
two we talk about our infrastructure and
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
its core Network
 
04:54:13.150 --> 04:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
redundancy being able to provide
 
04:54:16.030 --> 04:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
Wireless and routers and cyber security
 
04:54:17.788 --> 04:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
tenants on the external side of it we've
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
implemented an EDR MDR kind of endpoint
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
management detection in the last 18
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
months to th external threats coming
 
04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
into our system so we're looking at
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
bolstering that and also in terms of
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
again when we look at the W uh the
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
router components of our Network across
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
the the state we want to make sure we're
 
04:54:38.590 --> 04:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
moving to when we go through refresh
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
those pieces of equipment we're getting
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
equipment that have solid technical
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
background that doesn't have gaps in its
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
security a back door if you will for
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
people to come in so we're looking to
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have top-notch Network
 
04:54:53.788 --> 04:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
equipment and things of that nature in
 
04:54:57.070 --> 04:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
place to safeguard our our
 
04:54:59.070 --> 04:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
data follow
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman so in the
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
outline that you have here under the
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
detail so what what did you where's the
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
$400,000 that you paired down from this
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
1 point2 what's different from what you
 
04:55:09.958 --> 04:55:10.830 align:start position:0%
1 point2 what's different from what you
outlined

04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
04:55:10.840 --> 04:55:11.788 align:start position:0%
outlined
in

04:55:11.788 --> 04:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:55:16.510 --> 04:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
listed we're likely to still make those
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
Investments we're simply asking less
 
04:55:24.548 --> 04:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
from the state we'll have to look at our
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
own resources for the
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
balance okay thank
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
you so if I heard you correctly if if we
 
04:55:36.030 --> 04:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
can't we can't fund the entire eight we
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
can't do something like 200,000 or 250
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
for it infrastructure you would welcome
 
04:55:45.990 --> 04:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we will say thank you I I thought
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to be sure thank
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
you representative bogert just for my
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
own clarification on
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
page no page number but as I turn over
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the first page so you're looking for
 
04:56:04.440 --> 04:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
to the first page so you're looking for
17.5

04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
17.5
 
04:56:11.190 --> 04:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
million there and then an additional
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
700,000 for the welding no no the the
 
04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
the original request when we put in our
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
our six-year plan was for 17 the
 
04:56:25.548 --> 04:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
governor's budget came back with no
 
04:56:28.590 --> 04:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
funding the request for the project in
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
Rochester to move that welding lab from
 
04:56:33.628 --> 04:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
Rochester to Portsmith was a late
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
arising uh initiative and we had
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
originally anticipated Federal support
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
for that that the funding is currently
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
held up and we are trying to facilitate
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
moving that program and expanding it
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
before we lose the lease in
 
04:56:54.510 --> 04:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester so this is a new request
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
separate from anything else and we've
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
we've sort of stepped away from from
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
everything else that was
 
04:57:03.150 --> 04:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
there follow up follow up because I'm
 
04:57:06.910 --> 04:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
still slightly in the gray area here so
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
the 17.5 is off the table and
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes with the exception of the it the
 
04:57:16.990 --> 04:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
800,000 for it okay so you have the it
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
is 800,000 you're requesting that was
 
04:57:22.788 --> 04:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
originally denied so this is an
 
04:57:26.788 --> 04:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
additional request yes outside and the
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
700,000 is an additional request correct
 
04:57:31.470 --> 04:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:57:35.310 --> 04:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
side correct thank you the 700,000 has
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
been okayed in the governor's budget
 
04:57:41.310 --> 04:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay that's what I'm trying to get to
 
04:57:41.320 --> 04:57:42.350 align:start position:0%
okay that's what I'm trying to get to
thank

04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
you Miss
 
04:57:48.830 --> 04:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
Newman okay I'm I'm confused now um
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
Chancellor based on what you said that
 
04:57:51.240 --> 04:57:52.470 align:start position:0%
Chancellor based on what you said that
moving

04:57:52.470 --> 04:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
moving
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
this oh from place what was whatever was
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
being moved did I understand you to say
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
that it was a it was going to be a
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
Federal grant so we originally had a
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
congressionally directed spending for
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
$700,000 to support moving the welding
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
lab that's currently in Rochester yeah
 
04:58:19.230 --> 04:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
to Portsmith that funding is currently
 
04:58:21.150 --> 04:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
tied up with other congressionally
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
directed spending and there's
 
04:58:24.670 --> 04:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about whether those funds
 
04:58:26.990 --> 04:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
available follow up Ju Just to follow up
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify the
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
uncertainty I'm just it may or may not
 
04:58:39.070 --> 04:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
come always a possibility and I I'll
 
04:58:41.548 --> 04:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you if were to be released
 
04:58:43.628 --> 04:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
timely so that we could use it I would
 
04:58:45.750 --> 04:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
come right back here and tell you we we
 
04:58:47.310 --> 04:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
can relinquish the
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
request okay
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
good follow up on the very first item on
 
04:58:56.030 --> 04:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
these under the
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
um your your request in your six-year
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
plan on the 175 your very first item
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
project in priority order with that
 
04:59:07.270 --> 04:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
energy management
 
04:59:09.868 --> 04:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
system I just glanced at it quickly but
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's I mean I can understand why it was
 
04:59:15.628 --> 04:59:15.638 align:start position:0%
Priority One
 
04:59:15.638 --> 04:59:17.150 align:start position:0%
Priority One
um

04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:20.350 --> 04:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have
 
04:59:20.360 --> 04:59:22.948 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have
that

04:59:22.948 --> 04:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
then effects on heating ventilation and
 
04:59:26.320 --> 04:59:27.670 align:start position:0%
then effects on heating ventilation and
lighting

04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
lighting
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
are are and you can finish the sentence
 
04:59:33.548 --> 04:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
thank you right right now we have
 
04:59:36.070 --> 04:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
facilities across the state for our
 
04:59:36.080 --> 04:59:36.990 align:start position:0%
facilities across the state for our
seven

04:59:36.990 --> 04:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
colleges each of those systems is manage
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
separately this basically
 
04:59:47.670 --> 04:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
creates a smart environment where we can
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
manage remotely all of these things
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
optimize the energy use on these pieces
 
04:59:56.830 --> 04:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
of equipment but also help us identify
 
04:59:58.590 --> 04:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
where we've got a water leak where we've
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
got a boiler that's running too hot
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
things that will tend to degrade that
 
05:00:05.548 --> 05:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
equipment more rapidly so it's a
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
combination of more efficient coste
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
effective energy management but also
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
should extend the life of these uh
 
05:00:15.868 --> 05:00:15.878 align:start position:0%
pieces of equipment should also mitigate
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
some of the risks we face when pipes
 
05:00:19.948 --> 05:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
break when we have flooding because
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
those things go undetected at a location
 
05:00:24.510 --> 05:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's not not physically staffed at the
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
time it occurs thank you you're
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you any further
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative kazinski thank
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
you um so you said the total to move
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
from Rochester to peas is one .4
 
05:00:41.360 --> 05:00:43.830 align:start position:0%
from Rochester to peas is one .4
million

05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
what so Ju Just I'm trying to so this is
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
going from a leas building to you're
 
05:00:53.788 --> 05:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
building a new building no we have a
 
05:00:56.590 --> 05:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
facility at peas we've got to refit the
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
space currently there are 14 welding
 
05:01:01.948 --> 05:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
booths in the facility in Rochester
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
we're planning to expand that to 18
 
05:01:06.548 --> 05:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
we'll run multiple cohorts through that
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
there are some additional areas where
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
equipment is used that's complimentary
 
05:01:15.310 --> 05:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
to welding so the equipment but also the
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
ventilation that goes with that for
 
05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
safety uh to ensure that that students
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
and and faculty who are participating in
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
those programs are are kept
 
05:01:28.990 --> 05:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
healthy okay thank you you're
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
welcome seeing no further questions
 
05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
let's move on to your laps
 
05:01:38.430 --> 05:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
extensions thank you Mr
 
05:01:43.628 --> 05:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
chair so in the laws of 23 U
 
05:01:46.030 --> 05:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
1131 um
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
111 for critical maintenance we're
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
asking that that be um
 
05:01:51.240 --> 05:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
asking that that be um
Extended

05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.590 --> 05:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
um because we've um spent encumbered uh
 
05:01:58.600 --> 05:02:00.548 align:start position:0%
um because we've um spent encumbered uh
2,486

05:02:00.548 --> 05:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
2,486
 
05:02:06.150 --> 05:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
275 uh is unspent um I'm sorry the 938
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
725 has been spent and encumbered
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh leaving it available to
 
05:02:15.628 --> 05:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
2486 but um I have consultants in the
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
design phase and contracts being uh
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
bidding um right now to do this work as
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
it um as the same for the next um for
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
the last two items okay the next
 
05:02:32.830 --> 05:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh for the um respiratory
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
therapy program laws of 23
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
1131 um
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
163 um that is um we started the design
 
05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
phase but do you want to speak if if I
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
may if I interrupt May interrupt you sir
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
I think um representative Jack is
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
handling this I've um if he has a
 
05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
question otherwise we're we're fine with
 
05:02:57.788 --> 05:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
with the lapses and if we notice your
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line says funds to lapse from
 
05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
completed projects is none correct we're
 
05:03:03.948 --> 05:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
actually we're not that concerned with
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
how projects are going if they're being
 
05:03:08.110 --> 05:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
extended okay so in the interest of time
 
05:03:10.030 --> 05:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
I've cross checked your four that you to
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
extend I have two uh other ones we have
 
05:03:15.150 --> 05:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
2019 NCC engineering technology
 
05:03:20.150 --> 05:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
renovation that's one of the completed
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
yes so that should lapse with zero yep
 
05:03:23.948 --> 05:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
and then there's another one that was
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated in 2021 section
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
14 uh for critical maintenance and that
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
one is completely all right
 
05:03:37.948 --> 05:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
good thank you see we can we could
 
05:03:40.628 --> 05:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes speed things up here thank uh
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
and and that's it that that we have
 
05:03:44.350 --> 05:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
unless there's any further questions for
 
05:03:44.360 --> 05:03:45.788 align:start position:0%
unless there's any further questions for
Community

05:03:45.788 --> 05:03:45.798 align:start position:0%
Community
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
College seeing none gentlemen thank you
 
05:03:50.270 --> 05:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
very much for your presentation thank
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
you all for your time we appreciate your
 
05:03:52.160 --> 05:04:18.708 align:start position:0%
you all for your time we appreciate your
support

05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
next up we have the fish and game
 
05:04:20.760 --> 05:04:39.910 align:start position:0%
next up we have the fish and game
department

05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't know but the question I want
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
to ask you is yes he does the short
 
05:04:49.470 --> 05:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
corrected it is it's in
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.830 --> 05:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
got good afternoon thank you chairman
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
and committee members I'm Stephanie Simi
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director for New
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and I have with
 
05:05:37.708 --> 05:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
me our business division Chief Cath
 
05:05:40.510 --> 05:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
leonti and our Inland Fishery Chief
 
05:05:40.520 --> 05:05:41.390 align:start position:0%
leonti and our Inland Fishery Chief
Diane

05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
Diane
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
Timmons um as you are aware I'm new to
 
05:05:46.750 --> 05:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
this seat so I wasn't necessarily here
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
when we built this budget but uh that's
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing the power horses here
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll walk through it a little
 
05:05:55.628 --> 05:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
bit and feel free to ask any questions
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
or however the chairman would like to
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
proceed with this welcome to New
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much I'm very
 
05:06:02.110 --> 05:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
excited to be
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
here so we did hand out some documents
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
um you will see our original ask was the
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh document that has the very fine print
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then as you can see uh the capital
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's budget the capital uh
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
that she appropriated or at least
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
identified in her budget is slightly
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
different than what we originally asked
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
for uh you'll see four projects there
 
05:06:27.390 --> 05:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
four things that we had asked for
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
initially which was Hatchery Predator
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
control uh we asked to replace a 50 foot
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
25ton trailer we asked for Inland
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
Fisheries equipment and we also
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
requested replacement of a John Deere
 
05:06:41.628 --> 05:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
backhoe what is in the governor's budget
 
05:06:44.590 --> 05:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
is the Hatchery Predator control the
 
05:06:46.548 --> 05:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
replacement of the 50-foot trailer and
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
the Inland Fisheries equipment but not
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
the backhoe um I would like to if
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity I would like to
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
request reconsideration of the backo
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
because it's much needed however I'm not
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
sure of the process here so we can get
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
to that in a little later um I will say
 
05:07:04.510 --> 05:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the allocations that you will
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
see that we asked for initially are
 
05:07:08.670 --> 05:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
lower than what was uh put in the
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and and that's because
 
05:07:12.190 --> 05:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
we did have some changes along the way
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
when the first capital uh request was
 
05:07:17.948 --> 05:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
put in for the Hatchery Predator control
 
05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
um there were some little nuances that
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
we hadn't accounted for and that's why
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a difference and she has
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
obviously uh addressed that and then
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
also in the Inland Fisheries equipment
 
05:07:30.190 --> 05:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh we had not received a formal quote
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
yet for some of the generator uh work or
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
generators that we needed and
 
05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
subsequently uh we spoke with was a Das
 
05:07:39.628 --> 05:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
I think that identified that hey this is
 
05:07:40.990 --> 05:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
the quote that we received it was
 
05:07:42.430 --> 05:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
considerably more so you'll see that
 
05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
that is a change in that amount as
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
well I notice these are not General
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
funds these are all fish from the fish
 
05:07:52.990 --> 05:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
and game fund is that correct that is
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
correct uh and I will defer to Mr Shay
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
to answer your question on how we can
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
address that backo request okay thank
 
05:08:06.430 --> 05:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
you it would really depend on how
 
05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
healthy the fishing game fund is to
 
05:08:10.990 --> 05:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
handle the debt service related to to
 
05:08:14.070 --> 05:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
that um project or that piece of
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
equipment so I
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
think would be the department would need
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure they were okay with the
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
health of the fund to take on that debt
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
service and I know there's been some
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions about the fund and its Health
 
05:08:27.280 --> 05:08:28.150 align:start position:0%
questions about the fund and its Health
going

05:08:28.150 --> 05:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:08:30.230 --> 05:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
forward yes thank you very much I
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate that do you want to add
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
anything to that please I do not okay um
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any other questions
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
relevant to the original request and to
 
05:08:39.920 --> 05:08:41.230 align:start position:0%
relevant to the original request and to
the

05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:44.548 --> 05:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
governor's representative voy thank you
 
05:08:46.350 --> 05:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you ladies for
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question how old is the back
 
05:08:52.590 --> 05:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
home it is actually I have that I think
 
05:08:52.600 --> 05:08:53.868 align:start position:0%
home it is actually I have that I think
it's

05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
almost 50 let me find out where it is
 
05:08:59.150 --> 05:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
here it is it's over 27 it's 27 years
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
old and new parts are discontinued we
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
have tried to repair it through various
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
options we even tried to find an old one
 
05:09:09.708 --> 05:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
as a surplus we w
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
in other words you were looking for
 
05:09:12.030 --> 05:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
MacGyver to fix it is that what you're
 
05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
saying yes yes we couldn't find MacGyver
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't find MacGyver okay yes but the
 
05:09:19.708 --> 05:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
option too is if we can replace it with
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
a um a same brand we could potentially
 
05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
keep this some of the parts might be
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
transferable to a newer unit not all
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
obviously because that's what we're
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
running into but yes what what is the
 
05:09:33.628 --> 05:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
cost of this the back new request yes
 
05:09:33.638 --> 05:09:35.788 align:start position:0%
cost of this the back new request yes
it's

05:09:35.788 --> 05:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:09:37.868 --> 05:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
350,000 that sounds about that sounds
 
05:09:40.110 --> 05:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
about right Mr chairman follow up
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
not not my size backles I I get that I
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
get that follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
the um Hatchery predator predator
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
control is this for the Hatchery down in
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
Nasher or is that for all the for all
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
the hatcheries in in the in the state
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
it's actually was originally for Milford
 
05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
and I will let I will let our chief of
 
05:10:01.708 --> 05:10:01.718 align:start position:0%
Inland fishery speak to
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
that yes hi so it was this quote is for
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Milford specifically okay we are looking
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
at um our other facilities as well and
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
obviously with the new
 
05:10:15.548 --> 05:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
modernization of new Hampton that will
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
be steel structured buildings okay one
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
last followup I just it's it's a
 
05:10:24.670 --> 05:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
curiosity question how how robust has
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
the Hatchery been over the last last
 
05:10:30.070 --> 05:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
couple of years and are are fishermen
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the the stocks being
 
05:10:34.230 --> 05:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
replenished in our in our streams and
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
Brooks oh 100% yes so um I can tell you
 
05:10:41.628 --> 05:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
that our recre ational angling
 
05:10:44.190 --> 05:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
is predominantly provided through
 
05:10:47.708 --> 05:10:47.718 align:start position:0%
stocking and it brings 1.4 billion to
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
our economy so it's tremendous angling
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
is one of the favorite pastimes of many
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
folks and those folks in state as well
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
as out of state and Milford Hatchery is
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
one of our it is the dominant hatchery
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the southern part of the state so
 
05:11:05.430 --> 05:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
excellent thank thank you for your work
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you Mr chairman
 
05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative Jack thank you Mr
 
05:11:10.548 --> 05:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
chairman am I correct that the hatchery
 
05:11:12.190 --> 05:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
in ASA that was just referenced is
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually a federal facility New Hampton
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
is our is our state facility NASA is a
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
federal Hatchery that's different so
 
05:11:23.310 --> 05:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
Milford is a Milford is our state
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
facility South that provides our
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
stocking in New Hampshire NASA does um
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
different products that are not state
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
funded thank you m you're welcome any
 
05:11:37.510 --> 05:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Newman
 
05:11:39.990 --> 05:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes Ju Just for my
 
05:11:42.430 --> 05:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
understanding this page shows the the
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
back ho for 350 but in the book it's
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
275 this is obviously more current the
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
more expensive price
 
05:11:55.628 --> 05:11:55.638 align:start position:0%
okay yes that's
 
05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
correct inflation okay
 
05:12:01.470 --> 05:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
yes so that's the figure working with
 
05:12:02.830 --> 05:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
350 not
 
05:12:06.788 --> 05:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions saying none ladies thank thank
 
05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
you very much for your presentation hold
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
on yeah so I've crosschecked your laps
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
extensions with Hospital 25 and they all
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
look fine so thank you very much unless
 
05:12:21.190 --> 05:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's any question about it we'll
 
05:12:23.070 --> 05:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
we'll continue those are there any
 
05:12:25.470 --> 05:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
questions on our current Appropriations
 
05:12:28.190 --> 05:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
for Capital funding I think
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
not thank you very much I'm sorry
 
05:12:32.670 --> 05:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative bogert okay I must have a
 
05:12:32.680 --> 05:12:33.708 align:start position:0%
representative bogert okay I must have a
blind

05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
blind
 
05:12:38.590 --> 05:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
spot um an earlier question was on the
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
the uh funding for the back ho because
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
you're asking that to be an addition
 
05:12:50.110 --> 05:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
to uh and it was said what the fishing
 
05:12:54.430 --> 05:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
game funding source or whatever bonding
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
ability or whatever uh but the answer
 
05:13:00.190 --> 05:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
never came out is do you have the
 
05:13:04.150 --> 05:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
ability to cover it and that was the
 
05:13:06.590 --> 05:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Crux of the whole
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
question that would be very dependent
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
upon on how what the re the end result
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
of this budget process will be once we
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
get to May and
 
05:13:20.070 --> 05:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
June yes
 
05:13:23.070 --> 05:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
followup can you scratch below the
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
surface of that statement a little bit
 
05:13:28.270 --> 05:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
because that was as vague as we we our
 
05:13:31.510 --> 05:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
budget our agency budget request had an
 
05:13:34.350 --> 05:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
amount of General funds that were a
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
Target amount by the governor's office
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
so we put in that amount of General
 
05:13:42.510 --> 05:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
funds going through the governor's phase
 
05:13:45.190 --> 05:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the budget those General funds were
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
removed putting
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
the amount that we were requesting onto
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted fishing game fund which
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
leaves us not with a healthy balance at
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the current bium we're going
 
05:14:05.110 --> 05:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
into so until those issues are resolved
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
we are really not sure what the health
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the fishing game will be at the end
 
05:14:13.470 --> 05:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:15.948 --> 05:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
bium thank
 
05:14:15.958 --> 05:14:19.830 align:start position:0%
bium thank
you

05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
yeah see no further
 
05:14:24.350 --> 05:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
questions okay something well I was just
 
05:14:26.350 --> 05:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
going to add that we are currently
 
05:14:29.788 --> 05:14:29.798 align:start position:0%
working with house division 2 on uh this
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
measure about the balance and where we
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
might be able to increase some of our
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
fees or our our registrations or other
 
05:14:41.190 --> 05:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
avenues for revenu to offset that so as
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
Kathy clearly identified that once we
 
05:14:45.390 --> 05:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
get through that process we'll have a
 
05:14:48.670 --> 05:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
better standing on where we can uh be
 
05:14:51.310 --> 05:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.190 --> 05:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
Bond thank you thank you very much thank

05:15:09.750 --> 05:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
time the Human Services
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:37.920 --> 05:16:07.910 align:start position:0%

05:27:54.270 --> 05:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
all right next up on our list is
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
or the capital budget presentation
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
welcome to public
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
you we did provide a slide deck for you
 
05:28:13.628 --> 05:28:13.638 align:start position:0%
to walk through um granted that we only
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
have currently two items in hb25 we
 
05:28:19.470 --> 05:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
thought you might be interested in um
 
05:28:22.270 --> 05:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
other items that the agency uh had on
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
their list as well as uh projects in
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
Flight if you will and where those
 
05:28:29.830 --> 05:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
stand so
 
05:28:31.948 --> 05:28:31.958 align:start position:0%
if ready to
 
05:28:35.310 --> 05:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
go um the very first page I think is
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
consistent with what you have in your uh
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
handout there in terms of our Medicaid
 
05:28:43.110 --> 05:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise modular strategy in terms of
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
the total funds that we're looking at
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
there 33 million project and about 3
 
05:28:51.788 --> 05:28:51.798 align:start position:0%
million in 3 milon 375 in general funds
 
05:28:53.470 --> 05:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
and the rest is a match with our federal
 
05:28:56.110 --> 05:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
funds so that's a 9010 match and then
 
05:28:58.750 --> 05:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
our modernizing the eligibility Services
 
05:29:01.948 --> 05:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
that's a 656 th000 on the general fund
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
with a match of about 1.2 million um
 
05:29:06.270 --> 05:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
from the federal government so those two
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
together um are a total for current uh
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
requests that are in
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
hb25 um I've asked my chief of
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
operations Dave weers who's sitting here
 
05:29:19.070 --> 05:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
with me to walk you through a little bit
 
05:29:22.350 --> 05:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
about what is the Medicaid Enterprise uh
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
strategy um what is that compris of it's
 
05:29:27.070 --> 05:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
a rather large project it's a 10-year
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
project we're halfway through the year
 
05:29:30.310 --> 05:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
some of you that have been on this
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee before probably remember us
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
asking about this five years ago so I'd
 
05:29:36.750 --> 05:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
like Dave to give you a brief update on
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um chair and members of the
 
05:29:44.470 --> 05:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David weeders Chief
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
Operating Officer for the record for
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS so the Medicaid Enterprise modular
 
05:29:52.190 --> 05:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
strategy is a strategy following Center
 
05:29:54.270 --> 05:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid and Medicare
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
Services um efforts for the the country
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
and what we did is we working with um
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
CMS as well as looking at other state
 
05:30:05.670 --> 05:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
Solutions and some of our Professional
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
Services providers came up with a
 
05:30:11.670 --> 05:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
strategic plan on how we could modularly
 
05:30:15.150 --> 05:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
replace the components of the current um
 
05:30:17.590 --> 05:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
Legacy system that is monolithic and
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
what that really means is we have a
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
really big system that does claims
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
processing it manages third-party
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
liability insurance um monitoring as
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
well as provider management call center
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
management and fiscal functions as well
 
05:30:33.510 --> 05:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
as data analytics and a number of other
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
things but that having one vendor to do
 
05:30:40.030 --> 05:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
all that work they subcontracted it out
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
sort of locked us in for a while and we
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
looked at an opportunity to modularly
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
replace it using cms's strategy that
 
05:30:50.190 --> 05:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
allows us to get best-in-class Solutions
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
as well as create a more competitive
 
05:30:53.948 --> 05:30:53.958 align:start position:0%
Marketplace for
 
05:30:56.110 --> 05:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
procurement and so we as the
 
05:30:58.350 --> 05:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner indicated we're in uh year
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
five of a 10-year plan we have other
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
capital projects that we'll highlight at
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
the end of this slide deck that was
 
05:31:07.628 --> 05:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
really helping us get started with this
 
05:31:10.548 --> 05:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
this 33 million and and 33 and 3/4
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
million uh dollar Capital effort is to
 
05:31:16.350 --> 05:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
support the implementation of the third
 
05:31:19.310 --> 05:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
party liability U module which is really
 
05:31:22.150 --> 05:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
gold at ensuring that Medicaid is the
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
last payer so if the if the claimant has
 
05:31:28.270 --> 05:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh commercial insurance or has other
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
insurance that can pay for the claim
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
that third party liability helps us
 
05:31:34.990 --> 05:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
identify those through verifications and
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
matching and reclaim those funds so that
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
05:31:40.470 --> 05:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
inadvertently pay a
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
claim and that should have been paid by
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
a different um insurance provider the
 
05:31:47.948 --> 05:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
other solution is a call center
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
management and so the the key strategy
 
05:31:52.510 --> 05:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
on the call center component is that
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
right now when you call the Department
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services for many of
 
05:31:59.948 --> 05:31:59.958 align:start position:0%
its programs 70 80 plus programs you
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
have different call centers managing
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
those phone calls I don't know if any of
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
you have ever called to a call center
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
only to be dumped to another call center
 
05:32:09.430 --> 05:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
to be dumped to another call center to
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
never actually get your answered the
 
05:32:13.470 --> 05:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
goal here is to have a centralized
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
solution so you can call one number that
 
05:32:17.470 --> 05:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
can triage have access to a knowledge
 
05:32:20.270 --> 05:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
base and a Care Management tool so that
 
05:32:22.270 --> 05:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
they can provide you the answers that
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
you need in real time and if they can't
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
escalate you to the right person at a
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
tier 2 level to resolve your issue or
 
05:32:33.868 --> 05:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
your request the third component or
 
05:32:36.430 --> 05:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
module is the Care Management or member
 
05:32:38.670 --> 05:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
management um module
 
05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
and what that one is meant to do for a
 
05:32:43.470 --> 05:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Enterprise is to take multiple
 
05:32:45.190 --> 05:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
case management systems that we have
 
05:32:47.788 --> 05:32:47.798 align:start position:0%
across our department and create that
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
overarching view following privacy and
 
05:32:53.310 --> 05:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
security rule um following all of our
 
05:32:55.868 --> 05:32:55.878 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws but in order to
 
05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that we can pull that together
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
and not do duplicative services for
 
05:33:02.948 --> 05:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
individuals but also make sure that they
 
05:33:05.470 --> 05:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
get services that they need in a timely
 
05:33:08.070 --> 05:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
manner currently we have multiple system
 
05:33:09.868 --> 05:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
doing this work so in multiple call
 
05:33:11.708 --> 05:33:11.718 align:start position:0%
centers so you call a call center they
 
05:33:14.548 --> 05:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
use their Care Management tool only to
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
find out that you need a service from
 
05:33:18.990 --> 05:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
public health to be moved to another
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
another call center and another tool so
 
05:33:23.150 --> 05:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
this really is gold at bringing
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency to the department and moving
 
05:33:28.190 --> 05:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
us forward for the mees strategy I just
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that Dave's talking
 
05:33:32.350 --> 05:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
about different call centers we don't T
 
05:33:35.230 --> 05:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
typically have large call centers like
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
we have people maybe people that are
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
call the call center right so we have
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
designated lines for people to call in
 
05:33:43.230 --> 05:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
with staff Manning those so I don't want
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
you to think that we've got five
 
05:33:47.868 --> 05:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
desparate uh call centers we have
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
probably eight different numbers that
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
people are calling into to take this
 
05:33:52.190 --> 05:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
money to be able to streamline and
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
leverage that money to benefit all of
 
05:33:56.230 --> 05:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
the systems across the department so the
 
05:33:58.190 --> 05:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
investment goes just beyond the obvious
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
of the of the Medicaid calling in system
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to make that
 
05:34:04.350 --> 05:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
clear thank you for the
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
clarification and so if there's no
 
05:34:08.948 --> 05:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
questions on that one I'll move to the
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
next slide oh sorry representative
 
05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman and Mr
 
05:34:16.708 --> 05:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
weeders and commissioner thank you very
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
much for taking my
 
05:34:21.548 --> 05:34:21.558 align:start position:0%
question this is kind of new to me
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
so work with me with the question that
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
I'm about to ask you because I don't
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
know how it fits into the grand scheme
 
05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
of things but I know that in this state
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
we have three Medicaid providers of Mer
 
05:34:35.350 --> 05:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
Health well sensed in centine that that
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
provide Medicaid services to to people
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
that that qualify for Medicaid services
 
05:34:42.830 --> 05:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
obviously they have the they have call
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
centers as well and they rely upon the
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
data that they get from the state how
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
does their ability to service those
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
clients uh synergize with with this
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
particular project and are they
 
05:34:57.070 --> 05:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
assisting the state in any way to make
 
05:34:59.708 --> 05:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
sure that the data that's being used is
 
05:35:01.948 --> 05:35:01.958 align:start position:0%
is the correct data whether it be from
 
05:35:03.670 --> 05:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
from a Care Management perspective or
 
05:35:06.150 --> 05:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
just having having a simple claim being
 
05:35:06.160 --> 05:35:08.430 align:start position:0%
just having having a simple claim being
processed

05:35:08.430 --> 05:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
processed
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
want me
 
05:35:12.430 --> 05:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
to certainly um so there's a number of
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
things that are synergized there so this
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
is a component of our call centers but
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
we we partner with a health caras
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
wellsense and New Hampshire Healthy
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
Families on a regular basis and these
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
Solutions are what they actually use so
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
they use our mismis our Medicaid
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
management information system for claims
 
05:35:33.788 --> 05:35:33.798 align:start position:0%
processing and they use our provider
 
05:35:35.788 --> 05:35:35.798 align:start position:0%
management component of that which are
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
some of the modules that we're actually
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
moving forward forward with the original
 
05:35:41.310 --> 05:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
capital what they how they would
 
05:35:43.708 --> 05:35:43.718 align:start position:0%
interact with the third party liability
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
is we we have an obligation if they
 
05:35:49.350 --> 05:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
don't catch it in their solution that we
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to have our own um
 
05:35:53.948 --> 05:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
third party liability insurance um
 
05:35:57.070 --> 05:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
contract um to ensure that we are doing
 
05:35:59.390 --> 05:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
that one extra step of auditing and
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the payments are going to
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the right processing I would say over
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
the last several years um the three mcos
 
05:36:07.868 --> 05:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
that we partner with have actually
 
05:36:10.708 --> 05:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
addressed a lot of that and we're not
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
anticipating um a lot of recoveries but
 
05:36:15.150 --> 05:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating being compliant with
 
05:36:17.990 --> 05:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
cms's regulations and requirements is to
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
have that contract in place and it helps
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
us reinforce the importance of that TPL
 
05:36:27.670 --> 05:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
or third party liability the go ahead no
 
05:36:30.310 --> 05:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
go go ahead and then the the the call
 
05:36:33.150 --> 05:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
center component uh is what we're doing
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
with the call center and the Care
 
05:36:37.110 --> 05:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
Management is is broader than just the
 
05:36:39.390 --> 05:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare so one of the things that CMS
 
05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
has allowed us to do is leverage
 
05:36:43.708 --> 05:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um Federal funding for Medicaid
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
enhancements in this Enterprise strategy
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
that could be leveraged across our
 
05:36:49.910 --> 05:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
department and build that Foundation
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
from which we don't have um all the
 
05:36:55.548 --> 05:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
funding or general funds to implement
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
the a call center solution which results
 
05:37:00.990 --> 05:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
in those teams of of individuals that
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner was referring to trying
 
05:37:04.910 --> 05:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
to handle those phone calls as best that
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
they can this is building this the
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for us to do that the the
 
05:37:11.548 --> 05:37:11.558 align:start position:0%
mco's call centers would be that tier
 
05:37:14.590 --> 05:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
two where they initially might call us
 
05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
and then we'd find that they need to go
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
to their their MCO we would help them
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
find their which MCO that they would go
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
to and they could choose and go to the
 
05:37:24.670 --> 05:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
mcos from there so we would be able to
 
05:37:26.230 --> 05:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
provide that information so that they
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
could choose the which call center to go
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
from from that point um so that's I
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
would say these three modules aren't as
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
tied to the MCO component but other
 
05:37:40.110 --> 05:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
components of the mees strategy like
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
provider management and claims
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
management claims processing really are
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that's where your question sort of
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
hits home in terms of how do we ensure
 
05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we have a good provider management
 
05:37:52.590 --> 05:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
solution so when our MCL are working
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
with their providers to onboard them
 
05:37:55.868 --> 05:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
into our system for claims processing
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we streamline that and build an
 
05:37:59.470 --> 05:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
efficient way for them to be able to do
 
05:37:59.480 --> 05:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
efficient way for them to be able to do
that

05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
work and I just want to clarify although
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
we partner we contract obviously with
 
05:38:07.230 --> 05:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
those mcos right so this is our system
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
that all of our providers are required
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
to use so it's it's mcos and Beyond um
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
for claims processing and others other
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
things Mr CH follow up I'm not surprised
 
05:38:21.310 --> 05:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
So ba based on based on that with the
 
05:38:24.110 --> 05:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
three with the three
 
05:38:27.350 --> 05:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
mcos you've coordinated with the three
 
05:38:30.110 --> 05:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
the three mcos and the mcos have for the
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word they've financed
 
05:38:34.270 --> 05:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
their side of their their side of the
 
05:38:36.670 --> 05:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
system so that they it complements
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
what's being done on on the state side
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
the theyve point I'm getting at is the
 
05:38:46.270 --> 05:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
mcos have paid their fair share and and
 
05:38:48.110 --> 05:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that taxpayer money isn't
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
being used but they've paid their fair
 
05:38:51.910 --> 05:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
share to ensure that that that
 
05:38:54.990 --> 05:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
synchronization is in place so that that
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
when they have to communicate with the
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
state one system's talking with the
 
05:38:59.708 --> 05:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
other system and vice versa if that
 
05:39:03.310 --> 05:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense yes okay yes I mean the the
 
05:39:04.990 --> 05:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
idea is we don't want to have duplicity
 
05:39:06.150 --> 05:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
right I mean the whole the whole point
 
05:39:08.390 --> 05:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
is to have one system that works well
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
together right I just follow I I just I
 
05:39:15.150 --> 05:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
with this particular
 
05:39:17.468 --> 05:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
process families that that that are
 
05:39:19.628 --> 05:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
participating with an MCO are being
 
05:39:22.390 --> 05:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
steered to the MCO and not taxing uh
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
somebody at at Department of Health and
 
05:39:25.830 --> 05:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh
 
05:39:27.910 --> 05:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
unneeded so that they're being gated
 
05:39:30.430 --> 05:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
correctly to where they need to go yes
 
05:39:32.750 --> 05:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay I appreciate the the answers thank
 
05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman okay continue thank you so on
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
the next slide where it indicates
 
05:39:43.788 --> 05:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
modernized eligibility services so this
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
is our our integrated eligibility and
 
05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment system for snap tanif and
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or food stamps um cash
 
05:39:52.750 --> 05:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
assistance and Medicaid insurance as
 
05:39:55.548 --> 05:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
well as the child care um system uses
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
that and in addition that system last
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
year um supports the developmental
 
05:40:03.868 --> 05:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities um and the area agency
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
supporting that that that population
 
05:40:07.990 --> 05:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
within our state
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
and so this specific Capital project is
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
really focused at enhancing the
 
05:40:15.910 --> 05:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
self-service component which we call New
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire easy um so New Hampshire easy
 
05:40:21.390 --> 05:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
is a website that both providers as well
 
05:40:24.590 --> 05:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
as um clients can go to and find a
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
wealth of information on how they can
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
apply for these Services however it has
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
been indicated in many cases that it's
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
not very um it's more it's not as
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
intuitive to manage and it's not put in
 
05:40:40.708 --> 05:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
a in a current format so most people
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
today are expecting to be able to go to
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
a website fill in information click
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
submit and go forward our website has a
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
number of PDF forms that they have to
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
fill out and then scan and then submit
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
them as part of the application our goal
 
05:40:54.468 --> 05:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
is to try to streamline some of those
 
05:40:56.430 --> 05:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
services and make it more self-service
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
oriented which in in turn will reduce
 
05:41:03.310 --> 05:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
the redeterminations and the delays for
 
05:41:07.948 --> 05:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
services as well as um um errors in
 
05:41:10.510 --> 05:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
terms of building in the scanned
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
documents that you can't read the
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
information that was written on them
 
05:41:16.030 --> 05:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
having to call them back and get that
 
05:41:18.670 --> 05:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
information this this allows for an
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
improved customer experience but it also
 
05:41:23.910 --> 05:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
allows for better verification so we're
 
05:41:26.350 --> 05:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
obligated to verify all the information
 
05:41:28.670 --> 05:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
of an individual applying for these
 
05:41:30.990 --> 05:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
services having it being an automated
 
05:41:32.708 --> 05:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
system where it has error checking to
 
05:41:34.110 --> 05:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that we get the accurate
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
information the first time allows us to
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
check against those verification
 
05:41:39.548 --> 05:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
databases to ensure that we have the
 
05:41:41.708 --> 05:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
right person the right income
 
05:41:43.948 --> 05:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
information the right um employment
 
05:41:45.468 --> 05:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
information and then be able to make
 
05:41:47.430 --> 05:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
that determination and move it
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
forward the the last part of this of the
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
goals is to be able to utilize um what I
 
05:41:54.750 --> 05:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
would consider old technology but it's
 
05:41:56.468 --> 05:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
current technology for healthcare is
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
using SMS texting to be able to meet a a
 
05:42:02.430 --> 05:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
client where they're at so we would be
 
05:42:05.150 --> 05:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
using text and email in addition to the
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
phone and and mail office offerings I
 
05:42:11.350 --> 05:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
mean we we will always have individuals
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
that will choose to have a paper um
 
05:42:16.948 --> 05:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
application or choose to have access to
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
that kind of paper U communication
 
05:42:21.390 --> 05:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
through their through their post office
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
but we want to also realize that a lot
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
of our population do have cell phones
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
that could use that to actually apply
 
05:42:29.708 --> 05:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
take pictures of their driver's license
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
take pictures of their of their
 
05:42:33.548 --> 05:42:33.558 align:start position:0%
documents and upload them in real time
 
05:42:39.468 --> 05:42:39.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:39.478 --> 05:42:40.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman question do
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
has has the has Health and Human
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
Services as a department um as it
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
relates to text messaging has there been
 
05:42:54.390 --> 05:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
any security concerns as it relates to
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
the participant in an employee uh having
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
that face-to-face
 
05:43:01.708 --> 05:43:01.718 align:start position:0%
interaction um certainly there's always
 
05:43:04.430 --> 05:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities to employ good security
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
practices when you use new digital
 
05:43:09.390 --> 05:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
Solutions the way we would use text
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
messaging is similar to the way
 
05:43:12.948 --> 05:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals would use it where we would
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
text them a link to the portal go log
 
05:43:17.390 --> 05:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire easy so you can see
 
05:43:19.548 --> 05:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
the documents that you need to upload
 
05:43:21.430 --> 05:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
and always redirecting them to a site
 
05:43:23.468 --> 05:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
that is a secure site to maintain the
 
05:43:25.468 --> 05:43:25.478 align:start position:0%
communication of protected health
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
information or personally identifiable
 
05:43:31.310 --> 05:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
information but it does allow us to in
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
real time say hey you have a notice
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for you in New Hampshire easy if
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking for your determination on
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
your application please click this link
 
05:43:42.910 --> 05:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
so that that was the goal of utilizing
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
SMS U we would never we would also have
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
the similar disclosures as you would see
 
05:43:49.948 --> 05:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
in other commercial environments where
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
it says we're not going to ask you for
 
05:43:53.708 --> 05:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
your password or date of birth or any of
 
05:43:55.948 --> 05:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
your Social Security or other personally
 
05:43:58.750 --> 05:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
identifiable information via text or
 
05:44:01.070 --> 05:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
email we're always going to ask you to
 
05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
submit that through our secure New
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire easy website thank
 
05:44:07.868 --> 05:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
you and if I could just just on this
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
piece um the goal is to make New
 
05:44:12.190 --> 05:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire easy easy right we often get
 
05:44:13.670 --> 05:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
the feedback that New Hampshire easy
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
isn't easy U part of that is this is um
 
05:44:19.868 --> 05:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
sort of a service that hasn't been as
 
05:44:21.628 --> 05:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
automated as some of our other areas of
 
05:44:24.070 --> 05:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
the department so we are relyant upon
 
05:44:26.670 --> 05:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
staff which I don't have a lot of and I
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of vacancies so the more
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
vacancies I have the more time it takes
 
05:44:32.110 --> 05:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
for people to get their answers on
 
05:44:34.628 --> 05:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
determinations for eligibility so if we
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
can even just automating this and this
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
this part of it here is going to make a
 
05:44:40.190 --> 05:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
big difference in our efficiency and
 
05:44:42.190 --> 05:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
speeds and getting people the services
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
quicker and then if I could I'm sorry go
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
right if I could have one more thing one
 
05:44:51.708 --> 05:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
of the things that we did notice because
 
05:44:54.030 --> 05:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
we do submit our Capital budgets about
 
05:44:57.430 --> 05:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
um 12 months in advance we were able to
 
05:45:00.110 --> 05:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
work with our our federal partners and
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
we anticipate being able to reduce the
 
05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
general fund impact to just below
 
05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
$600,000 so that basically the current
 
05:45:11.670 --> 05:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
breakdown is 35% general fund Federal
 
05:45:14.030 --> 05:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
65% we're anticipating being able to
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
bring that to 32% General and then 68%
 
05:45:20.350 --> 05:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
Federal we don't have that approved yet
 
05:45:21.990 --> 05:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
because we can't get approval until we
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
go we get the funding but that is where
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
we are getting signals as to our our
 
05:45:29.270 --> 05:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
cost allocation
 
05:45:33.590 --> 05:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
breakdown Mr Shay are you okay set with
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
that I think what I just heard is it
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
would they need to be appropriate ated
 
05:45:38.670 --> 05:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
the funds first and then they would be
 
05:45:41.430 --> 05:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
able to get a different cost allocation
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
but correct me if I'm
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
wrong you're not wrong it's it but
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's how all of our Capital submittals
 
05:45:49.430 --> 05:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
are so if if the if the committee was
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this in terms of general fund
 
05:45:53.230 --> 05:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
impacts we we anticipate being able to
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
reduce that general fund impact for this
 
05:45:57.830 --> 05:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
Con this Capital project by just a
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
little over
 
05:46:01.708 --> 05:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
$56,000 and that would lapse at the end
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
of the project if if the full amount was
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated yes it would it would lapse
 
05:46:08.350 --> 05:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of the project project right
 
05:46:09.910 --> 05:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't make any change at this
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
time because they don't know for sure
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
that the federal government will give
 
05:46:14.190 --> 05:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
them the the ratio that they're asking
 
05:46:16.270 --> 05:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
for thank you but we just wanted to
 
05:46:17.708 --> 05:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
share that that was what we were
 
05:46:20.548 --> 05:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
pursuing that's what we'd like to hear
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you some
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
years ago we were coping with the
 
05:46:25.708 --> 05:46:25.718 align:start position:0%
situation where the federal government
 
05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
said your systems aren't compliant with
 
05:46:29.628 --> 05:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
our requirements and we're within an
 
05:46:31.948 --> 05:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
inch of finding you or if I'm
 
05:46:34.468 --> 05:46:34.478 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing are we out of that woods
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:40.030 --> 05:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
that the government happy we're always
 
05:46:41.788 --> 05:46:41.798 align:start position:0%
in the woods feels
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
like this isn't Disneyland I think
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's a complex question however um we
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
have a number of systems but there are
 
05:46:52.150 --> 05:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
there was one um capital budget that you
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
may be referring to representative Jack
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
U which was the electronic visit
 
05:46:57.750 --> 05:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
verification project that we had a
 
05:47:01.110 --> 05:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
capital project for we we have been we
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
have are currently compliant with the
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
Home Health Care component of the
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
electronic phys verification system and
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
we are no longer paying fines to the
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
federal government for those um we are
 
05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
not entirely complete with that project
 
05:47:17.788 --> 05:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
so we are continuing that project to add
 
05:47:19.708 --> 05:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
the area agencies for developmental
 
05:47:21.670 --> 05:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities however that was not where
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
we were
 
05:47:25.868 --> 05:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
non-compliant representative
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
alom thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so 90%
 
05:47:33.830 --> 05:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the cost is in federal hands what are
 
05:47:35.468 --> 05:47:35.478 align:start position:0%
you hearing from the federal government
 
05:47:35.478 --> 05:47:37.030 align:start position:0%
you hearing from the federal government
about

05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
that money because we're hearing a lot
 
05:47:40.350 --> 05:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
of things about what's going on and so
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
funding I don't I'll let I'll let Nathan
 
05:47:50.830 --> 05:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
um answer specifically but in terms of
 
05:47:52.910 --> 05:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
our it capital costs that's not money
 
05:47:55.270 --> 05:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
that is being looked at right now or
 
05:47:57.468 --> 05:47:57.478 align:start position:0%
targeted so it's different than some of
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the money that we might Federal money
 
05:48:00.750 --> 05:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
that REM receipt for public health or
 
05:48:02.750 --> 05:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
for services but for some of this
 
05:48:05.070 --> 05:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and technology part of
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
this side of things it's still at 90% we
 
05:48:08.750 --> 05:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't had any indication
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that's at risk sounds more secure
 
05:48:12.990 --> 05:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
right as long as he's not back there
 
05:48:14.548 --> 05:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
dancing around behind me I got that
 
05:48:16.510 --> 05:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
right you got you got thumbs up from
 
05:48:19.868 --> 05:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
right further questions none see none
 
05:48:22.320 --> 05:48:24.310 align:start position:0%
right further questions none see none
proceed

05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
please okay so the next so we've cover
 
05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've covered your two approved items in
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that is correct Mr
 
05:48:31.760 --> 05:48:37.270 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that is correct Mr
chair

05:48:37.270 --> 05:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.350 --> 05:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
okay so um I'm going to go through these
 
05:48:41.788 --> 05:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
at a real high level and then if you
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
have any questions specifically about
 
05:48:46.590 --> 05:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
these these um capital projects that are
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
not included in the current Governor's
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
hb25 submitt um at the high level the
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home security system at of
 
05:48:58.310 --> 05:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
$1.3 million in general funds no federal
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
funds or other funds that's really to
 
05:49:03.310 --> 05:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
complete this security system um upgrade
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the Glen Cliff home environment
 
05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
including Wireless internet throughout
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
the the campus so that um the clinicians
 
05:49:13.590 --> 05:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
can provide care no matter where they
 
05:49:16.788 --> 05:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
are on the campus um as well as video
 
05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
surveillance for different rooms and
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we are constantly inv
 
05:49:25.190 --> 05:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
visible to our patient our our um
 
05:49:29.548 --> 05:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
residents at the Glen Cliff home the the
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
Aging disability Resource Center or adrc
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
information referral system uh a million
 
05:49:37.830 --> 05:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
dollars General funds and million doll
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
federal funds is a total of $2 million
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's 50% federally funded through
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
CMS that that solution is to provide um
 
05:49:51.390 --> 05:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
information referral for about four um
 
05:49:54.230 --> 05:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
4,000 agencies using the system
 
05:49:57.070 --> 05:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
providing Services um to the agent
 
05:49:59.430 --> 05:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
community in our in our
 
05:50:02.070 --> 05:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
state the multilanguage support for
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
client notices in in terms of federal
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
regulations we're all oated to translate
 
05:50:12.468 --> 05:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
our information into um other languages
 
05:50:14.670 --> 05:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
specifically languages of populations
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
higher than a certain percentage in our
 
05:50:18.190 --> 05:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
state um Spanish is one of the
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
predominant ones that we're obligated to
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
translate into so we we're trying to
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
become compliant with our eligibility
 
05:50:27.510 --> 05:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
system to ensure that we are translating
 
05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
those notices into Spanish and other
 
05:50:33.390 --> 05:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
languages that are prevalent in our
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
state and that that one is u 90%
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
federally funded at a total of 1.2
 
05:50:43.510 --> 05:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
million in change and then the the
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
fourth one here is document management
 
05:50:47.590 --> 05:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
and retention so this one didn't make it
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
to our top of the list however it's
 
05:50:51.070 --> 05:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
super important in terms of efficiency
 
05:50:53.788 --> 05:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
for our state and our department where
 
05:50:56.350 --> 05:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
we have lots of data records that have
 
05:50:58.270 --> 05:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
different record retention periods in
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
each individual that works for public
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
service is obligated to manage their
 
05:51:02.878 --> 05:51:04.190 align:start position:0%
service is obligated to manage their
records

05:51:04.190 --> 05:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
records
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
appropriately and Destroy them when they
 
05:51:09.868 --> 05:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
when the retention period is over this
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
this solution automates that so that
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
emails Word documents reports all those
 
05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
thing all those items of record get
 
05:51:20.670 --> 05:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
assigned a record retention schedule and
 
05:51:22.468 --> 05:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
automatically destroys it at the end of
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
the retention period and manages it
 
05:51:26.590 --> 05:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
effectively to be compliant with with
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
record retention policy it is a a fairly
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
common thing in in government to have
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
these type of solutions to ensure that
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're not unnecessarily keeping records
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
around for
 
05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
decades in some cases longer as well as
 
05:51:43.070 --> 05:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
document management allows us to put
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
into a database a structure where we can
 
05:51:48.030 --> 05:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
retrieve information at a rapid pace so
 
05:51:50.990 --> 05:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
that when someone asks us where was that
 
05:51:52.390 --> 05:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
where was that application that was
 
05:51:55.628 --> 05:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
submitted on February 10th
 
05:51:58.590 --> 05:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
2021 by David weeders that we can go
 
05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
into the system and pull that up rapidly
 
05:52:02.430 --> 05:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
and show that it's still there because
 
05:52:05.190 --> 05:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's a record retention of 7 years and
 
05:52:06.868 --> 05:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
so it hasn't expired and that's why we
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
still have the record that solution is
 
05:52:12.910 --> 05:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
um estimated at or scheduled to be at
 
05:52:16.990 --> 05:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
1.45 million and it's 50% General funds
 
05:52:19.468 --> 05:52:19.478 align:start position:0%
and the reason why it's not a larger
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
Federal fund match is it's not just
 
05:52:22.590 --> 05:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it would be supporting the
 
05:52:25.030 --> 05:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
entire department that has M multitude
 
05:52:28.510 --> 05:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
of federal funding um
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
participation then the the last to the
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
DHHS elevator Replacements there are a
 
05:52:36.750 --> 05:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
total of I think eight elevators if I
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
remember correct maybe I got the number
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
wrong um they're they're over at our New
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and seven my apology
 
05:52:47.150 --> 05:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
seven elevators that are essentially end
 
05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
of life end of replacement that are
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
failing um at at different rates so the
 
05:52:52.590 --> 05:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital always has at
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
least one or two elevators not working
 
05:52:57.708 --> 05:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
at any given time which results in
 
05:52:59.708 --> 05:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
patients having to be rerouted through
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
different units in some cases as well as
 
05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
um manually having individuals carry
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
boxes and other materials up and
 
05:53:09.868 --> 05:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
downstairs whereas at Glen Cliff home
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
when the the elevator that is is at that
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
location fails they actually have to use
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
stairs for any transport and so not
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
replacing those and deferring
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance on those does run the risk
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
of us not having the ability to
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
transport patients and residents through
 
05:53:29.468 --> 05:53:29.478 align:start position:0%
our 24/7 facilities and it actually
 
05:53:32.270 --> 05:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
incurs an efficiency impact to our our
 
05:53:35.150 --> 05:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
productivity and services in those
 
05:53:37.750 --> 05:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
locations I know I know that there are
 
05:53:39.430 --> 05:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
other elevators throughout the state as
 
05:53:41.150 --> 05:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
well that were on I think a different
 
05:53:41.160 --> 05:53:42.670 align:start position:0%
well that were on I think a different
Department's

05:53:42.670 --> 05:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
05:53:42.680 --> 05:53:44.390 align:start position:0%
Department's
um

05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
submitt so
 
05:53:49.910 --> 05:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that one is estimated three three
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
just under 3 and a. half million 3.45
 
05:53:53.548 --> 05:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
million it's all General funds because
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the Departments the the divisions
 
05:53:59.150 --> 05:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
that it supports and do not qualify for
 
05:54:01.948 --> 05:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
for federal fund Federal funding and
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
then the last one here is the Glencliff
 
05:54:07.350 --> 05:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
home fuel system upgrade and so in in
 
05:54:09.788 --> 05:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
this case the system is not only end of
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
life end of replacement but there there
 
05:54:13.150 --> 05:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
really just aren't any parts we've
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
scavenged parts from other communities
 
05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
um that had those parts to try to get
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
repaired it is located in a a part of
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
the the the campus that actually lends
 
05:54:27.628 --> 05:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
itself to have high risk of it being U
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
damaged and could result if we don't
 
05:54:34.110 --> 05:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
repair it at some point in time in
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
violations where the dep dep Department
 
05:54:38.430 --> 05:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services will require
 
05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
us to replace it in order to continue
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
functioning um so that that solution is
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
is estimated $1.2 million and the the
 
05:54:49.628 --> 05:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
reason why the large amount is that we
 
05:54:52.948 --> 05:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
would have to not only relocate the tank
 
05:54:54.990 --> 05:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
but also ensure that all inspect
 
05:54:56.708 --> 05:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
everything on the campus ensure that the
 
05:54:58.750 --> 05:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
fuel system can be delivered properly so
 
05:55:01.830 --> 05:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of um construction work to
 
05:55:04.670 --> 05:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's done properly if you
 
05:55:07.230 --> 05:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
have any questions on any of those um we
 
05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
do have Todd here for Glen cliff and we
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
have um Ernie here for some of the the
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
it systems representative Newman please
 
05:55:15.948 --> 05:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
yes uh could I ask you about the Glen
 
05:55:19.390 --> 05:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
Cliffe fuel system uh what is the fuel
 
05:55:22.948 --> 05:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
system I mean what what type of what
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
does it do to heat because I was there a
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
few years ago when I saw I thought it
 
05:55:31.708 --> 05:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
looked pretty new it was a biomass
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
system with okay go ahead hello uh Todd
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
Bickford home executive director um you
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
were you went for a tour of the bi Mass
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
plant which is our Steam and Heat this
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
is basically a gas pump like if you go
 
05:55:46.948 --> 05:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
to a gas station it's in our grounds
 
05:55:49.150 --> 05:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
area but it's located in the middle of a
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
um busy parking lot so cars go around it
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
and because of its location um there's
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
an overhead power line to it that's been
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
knocked down a couple of times by trucks
 
05:56:00.430 --> 05:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
because it lwh hangs and the real
 
05:56:03.230 --> 05:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
concern is that it's 28 years old and
 
05:56:05.670 --> 05:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
Dees has inspected it the last three
 
05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
years but has said you're only passing
 
05:56:10.430 --> 05:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
because you're grandfathered um the tank
 
05:56:12.150 --> 05:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
itself is not double walled like it's
 
05:56:15.750 --> 05:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the um spill concrete pad
 
05:56:18.430 --> 05:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
around the the the pump itself is too
 
05:56:23.350 --> 05:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
small um for modern code so um if we fix
 
05:56:25.590 --> 05:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
it again quote unquote we have to
 
05:56:27.868 --> 05:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
replace it um and it is so aged I mean
 
05:56:29.350 --> 05:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
literally the last part we got like two
 
05:56:34.110 --> 05:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
years ago was off eBay um so it it's gas
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
oh the gas is we maintain our own Fleet
 
05:56:39.948 --> 05:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
we have uh four handicap vans for um
 
05:56:41.230 --> 05:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
transport residents to medical
 
05:56:43.750 --> 05:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
appointments we have a uh resident bus
 
05:56:45.868 --> 05:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
to take residen out for activities and
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
fun things uh then we maintain our own
 
05:56:50.750 --> 05:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
plowing Fleet because we maintain um two
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
and a half you been the campus so we do
 
05:56:55.708 --> 05:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
all our own plowing uh we have a a
 
05:56:59.750 --> 05:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
number of um four um off-road vehicles
 
05:57:02.230 --> 05:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
for also doing plowing and things like
 
05:57:06.468 --> 05:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
that follow quick followup so the
 
05:57:10.030 --> 05:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
biomass Heats heats water that makes
 
05:57:13.230 --> 05:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
steam but the steam is not heating the
 
05:57:16.468 --> 05:57:16.478 align:start position:0%
building totally so this is basically
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about I'm sorry I
 
05:57:21.628 --> 05:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
think it's my mistake you're okay
 
05:57:23.030 --> 05:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
clarify we're basically just talking
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
about a gas pump gas pump if you went to
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
the gas gas vehicles gas pump for your G
 
05:57:29.990 --> 05:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
not building
 
05:57:31.990 --> 05:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
Sor there we
 
05:57:35.230 --> 05:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
go that's great yeah I think the pieces
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
here they're selfs staining facility
 
05:57:39.030 --> 05:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
campus right so everything is on there
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the gas that Supply is the supplies
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
to all of the work that needs to get
 
05:57:46.868 --> 05:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
done and separate from the heat so they
 
05:57:48.708 --> 05:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
could run to the gas station a million
 
05:57:52.708 --> 05:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:54.910 --> 05:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
own representative
 
05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
kazinski well we're talking about that
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
how how big of a tank is
 
05:58:04.830 --> 05:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
this I believe it is a 700 gallon
 
05:58:07.948 --> 05:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
tank that's $1.2
 
05:58:10.788 --> 05:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
million the reason it's uh so expensive
 
05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
is not only do we need to replace it but
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
we need to move it and that involves
 
05:58:16.350 --> 05:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
moving power lines moving the tank
 
05:58:18.468 --> 05:58:18.478 align:start position:0%
bringing it up to code um doing some
 
05:58:20.708 --> 05:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
grading work um those type of things so
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's a significant
 
05:58:25.590 --> 05:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
project okay thank
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:58:30.030 --> 05:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr
 
05:58:31.990 --> 05:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
chairman can't begin to tell you how
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
many times I've driven past Glen cliff
 
05:58:36.830 --> 05:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
on my way to Woodsville and
 
05:58:38.868 --> 05:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
how sitting in the shadows of Mount
 
05:58:41.110 --> 05:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
musaki how remote it is but I also
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that from a security
 
05:58:45.990 --> 05:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
perspective it's challenging because
 
05:58:47.230 --> 05:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's just you out in the middle of
 
05:58:50.910 --> 05:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
nowhere there my question is how often
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
do you get hikers that use the
 
05:58:52.558 --> 05:58:54.468 align:start position:0%
do you get hikers that use the
Appalachian

05:58:54.468 --> 05:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
Appalachian
 
05:58:56.910 --> 05:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
Trail frequent frequenting the campus
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
creating unnecessary concern for for the
 
05:59:02.590 --> 05:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
guest at Glen cff uh thank you for the
 
05:59:04.628 --> 05:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
question u i don't have specific numbers
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
but um having been there for 24 years I
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you it's easily a dozen to 15
 
05:59:12.110 --> 05:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
times a year it actually just happened
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
um about 6 weeks ago um on an off shift
 
05:59:18.510 --> 05:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
and two hikers um made it all the way
 
05:59:21.468 --> 05:59:21.478 align:start position:0%
into a resident area until a nurse asked
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
some and they were just looking to use a
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
phone but uh in the bathroom uh but it
 
05:59:28.750 --> 05:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
did speak to your point of we're in the
 
05:59:30.548 --> 05:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
middle of of the woods and on appalation
 
05:59:32.350 --> 05:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
trail so we get hikers quite frequently
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
and other people that that are looking
 
05:59:36.350 --> 05:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
for directions okay thank you appreciate
 
05:59:39.030 --> 05:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
represent Newman
 
05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
yes the the site visit was it was pretty
 
05:59:46.230 --> 05:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
it was really interesting um and I just
 
05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
asked and I usually ask this every time
 
05:59:51.270 --> 05:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe comes up so when you have to
 
05:59:54.510 --> 05:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
have any repairs done we talked several
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
years ago about people who have to come
 
05:59:59.270 --> 05:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
up to do contract work or that are
 
06:00:01.628 --> 06:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
looking to do a bid they make a site
 
06:00:03.390 --> 06:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
visit so they know what they're dealing
 
06:00:04.830 --> 06:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
with and where they're dealing with so
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
they can give you a complete um
 
06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
bid that that is correct we always
 
06:00:13.628 --> 06:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
strongly um advocate for Public Works to
 
06:00:16.990 --> 06:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
hold an a mandatory on-site um bid
 
06:00:20.070 --> 06:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
process for that exact reason because in
 
06:00:21.788 --> 06:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
in projects in the past we've run into
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
where uh you know bids come in and then
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
they're awarded and then the company's
 
06:00:27.030 --> 06:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
like whoa we didn't realize you were an
 
06:00:29.070 --> 06:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
hour and a half outside of conquer um
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
they see the state of New Hampshire and
 
06:00:33.310 --> 06:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:36.750 --> 06:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
conquer any further questions
 
06:00:39.628 --> 06:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
uh before we get into your uh lap system
 
06:00:41.230 --> 06:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
I've I've got a one quick one and you
 
06:00:42.830 --> 06:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to get it to me right away
 
06:00:44.788 --> 06:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
but if you know going back to your
 
06:00:44.798 --> 06:00:47.190 align:start position:0%
but if you know going back to your
elevator

06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
elevator
 
06:00:49.868 --> 06:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
project if you could get us the cost
 
06:00:49.878 --> 06:00:51.230 align:start position:0%
project if you could get us the cost
please

06:00:51.230 --> 06:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
just replacing the Blen Cliffe elevator
 
06:01:00.670 --> 06:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
just approximately sure get back to us
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative Jack will go
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
through the uh
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh lapse items with you because he's
 
06:01:10.190 --> 06:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
he's got his own system and it works
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
well and goes
 
06:01:15.190 --> 06:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
swiftly you don't know about this case
 
06:01:17.270 --> 06:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're up I already delivered for you I
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
already delivered for you representative
 
06:01:23.270 --> 06:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
Swift you're up all right well I have a
 
06:01:29.430 --> 06:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
good deal many more laps extensions than
 
06:01:31.070 --> 06:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
you have on your
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
sheet okay and I'm I'm having difficulty
 
06:01:36.990 --> 06:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
matching them up
 
06:01:41.150 --> 06:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
so let me go from the oldest one which
 
06:01:44.670 --> 06:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
is 2011 repl platform op option
 
06:01:47.230 --> 06:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
application and that's not mentioned in
 
06:01:49.868 --> 06:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
this year's House Bill
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
25 so is that project
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is from 2013 new
 
06:02:03.430 --> 06:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
heights incremental modernization again
 
06:02:07.468 --> 06:02:07.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
um if you bear with me give me one
 
06:02:11.110 --> 06:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
moment I need to pull up a spreadsheet I
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
know what you're pulling from I I'm
 
06:02:15.750 --> 06:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
pulling from the previous year's House
 
06:02:18.910 --> 06:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 what was appropriated or lapse
 
06:02:20.468 --> 06:02:20.478 align:start position:0%
extended in that
 
06:02:23.590 --> 06:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
budget and comparing it to what is laps
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
extended in this
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget and 2013 Roman 7e New Heights
 
06:02:30.000 --> 06:02:31.910 align:start position:0%
budget and 2013 Roman 7e New Heights
incremental

06:02:31.910 --> 06:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
06:02:34.468 --> 06:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
monitorization uh is not extended in
 
06:02:36.390 --> 06:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
this budget and was extended Ed in the
 
06:02:36.400 --> 06:02:38.230 align:start position:0%
this budget and was extended Ed in the
previous

06:02:38.230 --> 06:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
previous
 
06:02:41.430 --> 06:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
budget and that is correct as that
 
06:02:43.868 --> 06:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
project is also complete most most of
 
06:02:45.868 --> 06:02:45.878 align:start position:0%
these probably will be but we found over
 
06:02:48.750 --> 06:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
the years we don't want to miss one that
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
that you may have missed so we'll right
 
06:02:52.190 --> 06:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
the problem being they have nine items
 
06:02:54.030 --> 06:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
on their list and I have about
 
06:02:57.670 --> 06:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
25 so we're going to have
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
to um from 2015 Roman 7 L New Hampshire
 
06:03:09.310 --> 06:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:11.468 --> 06:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm right yeah I just need to give
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
Dave a minute to look some of that up
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
because we have a couple of projects
 
06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
happening at New Hampshire hospital so
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
I'd need to know specifically which
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:30.468 --> 06:03:30.478 align:start position:0%
L and I apologize to the rest of the
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee but there's I mean we're we're
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
talking about over half a page
 
06:03:39.708 --> 06:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
of items here so and it doesn't match up
 
06:03:41.788 --> 06:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
well with what they
 
06:03:50.948 --> 06:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:54.468 --> 06:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
money so you're on House Bill 25 from
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
well previous year the the original
 
06:03:59.230 --> 06:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation is from
 
06:04:02.190 --> 06:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
2015 uh Romans and the references Roman
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
7 letter L New Hampshire hospital
 
06:04:07.070 --> 06:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
renovation of I'll make a suggestion can
 
06:04:09.270 --> 06:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
we go over the ones that you know of
 
06:04:12.468 --> 06:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
that you want to have approved and Marty
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
you can get with them and give them your
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
list and they can either come back or or
 
06:04:18.150 --> 06:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
get you that information for Friday's
 
06:04:19.628 --> 06:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
meeting all right if you're agreeable
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
that would be great because it allow
 
06:04:23.830 --> 06:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
wrap up committee we can go through this
 
06:04:26.230 --> 06:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
list if you want to do that just just
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
give them that list that you've got yeah
 
06:04:29.390 --> 06:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
if you provided to us I don't know if we
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
have access to those spreadsheets to get
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
you the accurate information sitting
 
06:04:34.110 --> 06:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
right here I think that's what Dave is
 
06:04:35.750 --> 06:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
trying to dig for but if you give them
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
that to us we can then fill it in and
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
get it back to you to get it to the
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
committee can you send them the thing I
 
06:04:45.230 --> 06:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
sent you okay
 
06:04:47.670 --> 06:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
great we'll get that back to you we can
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
how how would it be if uh Mr Shay sends
 
06:04:54.270 --> 06:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
you this document that I'm working from
 
06:04:58.070 --> 06:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
which he has and then honor before the
 
06:05:00.990 --> 06:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
day for the lapse extension subcommittee
 
06:05:03.390 --> 06:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
we work through it yeah we'll as soon as
 
06:05:04.750 --> 06:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
Chris gets that we'll get it filled out
 
06:05:08.190 --> 06:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:11.590 --> 06:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
