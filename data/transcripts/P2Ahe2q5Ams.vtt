00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
metric that we use the most to assess
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
debt affordability and it's also the the
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
metric that the rating agencies use um
 
00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
to evaluate Bond insures um when they're
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
assessing U the financial health of the
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
state so um just this updated numbers
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
what uh for example in in fisc year 20
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
what that shows is that our debt to
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
Remer ratio which is um the last line in
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
the slide is um so for for fisc year 20
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
the debt to runer ratio went down to
 
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
6.7% since our last estimate I think
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
last time we we showed you that it was
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
um we were estimating it was going to be
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
6.8% um now the the in the next slide
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to show you in a minute um
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
is is showing that in FIS year 2019 the
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
the metric was 6.4% so clearly um and
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
FIS year 20 the number changed um for uh
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
really the the primary reason is the um
 
00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
the revenues um the revenues decreased
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
compared to fiscal year 19 and that's
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
what caused the ratio to increase to
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
6.7% our estimate was higher it was 6.8%
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
so the good news here is that revenues
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
um for fisc year 20 came in stronger
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
than originally anticipated so uh we
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
were able to adjust that in in in a a
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
better number
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
so um the next point I would like to
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
make is um if you look at fiscal year
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
21 um the ratio is going down and is
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
going down to uh a very uh uh goodlook
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
number is 6.2%
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
um the reason for that is also um that
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
revenues are
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
um based on the estimates that we hear
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
from Department of Revenue it looks like
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
the revenues are going to come in um
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
stronger again than what was original
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated so what we did in our
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
assumptions here is we only adjusted
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue by a decrease of 2% which I
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
believe that's what they're anticipating
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
for uh for revenues in fiscal year 21 um
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
so we included that in the
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
calculation but this the the the the
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
main point of this change really is um
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
the in last December December 2020 we
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
issue bonds of
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
um um we had a new issue of 47 um 47
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
million normally uh we we issue
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 million each year and
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's the typical
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
um bonding authorization that we
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
calculate for this study 120 million for
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
the vium 60 million for the fiscal year
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 20 we only needed
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
approximate 47 million and that's what
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's the amount that we issued so with
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
less debt being um incurve we borrow
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
less uh our number went down the other
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
reason is that uh we were able to refin
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
we we did two refundings
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
um so we um so with those refundings we
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
we generated some savings and and again
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
the thatb service was reduced and and
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
with that the calculation um it shows
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
that the ratio went down to 6.2% so it
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
is a very goodlook number that's the way
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
we would like to see it unfortunately um
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
things change for fiscal year 22 and the
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
point that I want to make in 22 is
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh in this calculation we are uh we are
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
we are considering that we're going to
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
issue approximately 60 million in in new
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
money bonds but we're also including um
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
the um the possibility of issuing
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
additional 50 million which relates to
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
the PFA
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
remediation uh project those are bonds
 
00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:24.949 align:start position:0%
remediation uh project those are bonds
already

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
authorized and uh we don't know the
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
details of how those projects are going
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
but um there is a possibility that we
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
will end up issuing an additional 50
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
million for uh the FIFA remediation
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
project so with those two amounts of
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
6.7% and um of course that service at
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
the point increases so then uh the
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
following years um the ratio is looking
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit higher overall uh we
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
continue to say that this are uh this
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
are good numbers
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
and um you know despite the the changes
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
and the assumptions that we're making um
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
they continue to show that the Le the
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
levels are manageable so with that um I
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
think the question that you know that
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
you're that you want to hear from me
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
is we we still we still want to
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
recommend 120 million in bond and
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
authorizations um that's the number has
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
that has been recommended over the last
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
few sub few fiscal years so just to be
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
consistent we'll continue to recommend
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
that and we're just showing you the
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
numbers based on those authorizations so
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
we know for example that I believe the
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
governor's budget has 130 million um the
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
legislature May recommend different
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
amounts um those are policy decisions
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
that uh you all will have to discuss and
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
and determine what's the best approach
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
um to follow um again we feel like our
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
job is really to provide you with the
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
tools and the numbers so you're able to
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
determine um you know what is the best
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
approach um so those are the numbers I
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to get too deep into
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
the numbers um happy to answer any
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
questions I think the next slide with um
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
with this next slide show is is um again
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with what be presented
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
to you before um the
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
the the 10% really is a warning level
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
that we essentially if we have reached
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
that 10% on the debt to rer ratio we've
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
gone too far the uh the rating agencies
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
would like to see that um you know that
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
will put um
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
that for for variet reasons um this is
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
we're just right now we're talking about
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
um um debt levels um due to um bonds
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
being issued but we also have other uh
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
obligations the state has other
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
obligations uh pension obligations opep
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
obligations and and all of that is of
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
course considered as part of the overall
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
health of the state so our goal really
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
um is going to be to try to maintain the
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
de to reel ratio um um hopefully uh
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
lower and and maintain it that way to be
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
able to show that again to be consistent
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the states that policy um that is
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
um is managing um their debt levels um
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
again um this is uh you know one of the
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
credit positives um that the rating
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
agencies like to see um it just shows
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we we have the a borrowing capacity
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh to also um you know manage the
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
current uh projects but also to respond
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
to potential emergencies if there is a
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
need to issue to to deal with a
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
particular um emergency or initiative
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
that is important to to legislators and
 
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.829 align:start position:0%
that is important to to legislators and
policy

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
makers um the chart that is in the
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
middle of the page also shows obviously
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
the history how the Deb rent ratio has
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
performed uh over
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
time um you know back when we were um
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
closer to the recession the ratio went
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
up and it was managed uh over time um
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
during the last uh few
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
years uh again uh um FIS year 2018
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
2019 um it was um you know the lowest
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
number we've had in a while again due to
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and 20 we went back up but
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
but it was still we still we still
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
consider this that we have U manageable
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
that levels and and and that is really
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
um how um New Hampshire is recognized to
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
maintain this this conservative policy
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
in in his in his really being
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
praised um the last the last point on
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
this slide is is just to show you how
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
much uh we still have of authorized and
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
unissued um um debt and so we have 174
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
million that's still that has been
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
authorized but uh we haven't spent money
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
on those on those
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
projects um so with that um I'm going to
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
ask um Rachel if she would like to add
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything um and after that we will 'll
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions that
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
have sure uh good morning can can folks
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
hear me yes great great
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
um the only the only point I would add
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
just to pick up on where what Monica
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the 174 authorized
 
00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:58.990 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the 174 authorized
unissued

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
unissued
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
a small portion of that may have been
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
spent but but it's it's accurate to say
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we have not bonded it so when we
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
Bond we put together a a project list
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
and that list consists of uh prior
 
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:14.919 align:start position:0%
spending that we're reimbursing
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves for and future
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
projections uh so just just a little
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
detail but that 174 some of it may
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
be uh spent you know as we speak speak
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
but since we only Bond once a year we
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
scoop up all prior expenses and future
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
projections um but but no I I happy to
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions again with Monica
 
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.230 align:start position:0%
answer any questions again with Monica
but

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
um great thank you Rachel thank you very
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
much um mam Treasurer I know you have to
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
leave L around 10 to go to fiscal
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee as well um that's just for the
 
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.390 align:start position:0%
committee as well um that's just for the
committee

00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we'll ask you back but I do
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions if you could
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
174 million that is out there does that
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
include the $50
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
million for the uh pfoa um
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
remediation or is that on top of the
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
174 I believe that's included is that
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
correct Rachel just correct me if I'm
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
wrong you're abs absolutely right that
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
50 um thank you and I I know you re you
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
said you recommended 120
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
million um and I assume that that is
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
what you recommended to the governor as
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
well and he came in over that um what
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
does your debt
 
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
does your debt
affordability

00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
um percentage numbers look like at the
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
130 level versus the 120 for the next
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
foreseeable um future as youve laid out
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
in one of these
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
slides yes thank you for the question it
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
really doesn't change the ratio it
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
really Remains the Same and again just
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with with what we have
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
the treasury has recommended um we like
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
to utilize the 120 million and and and
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
and show you the numbers to to really
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
show you what that does um but we we we
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
we change the number to 130 million it
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
really doesn't change the ratio um again
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
I think for formality purposes we we
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
continue to recommend that 120 million
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
but a change of five million upper down
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't change the
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
number okay and and I'm sure at some
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
point um members of the committee will
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
ask what if it goes more than you know
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
five or six or it goes to the one 35
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
million level or something like that but
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ask you to speculate at
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
this point um we can handle that when
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
the questions come up
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was just gonna add I think I
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
think when you start seeing real changes
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
are when you start adding 50 million at
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
a time and and again I think as you saw
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
and and when we added the the the 50
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
million um of the pfa's remediation
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
project that's when we start seeing
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
changes of half of a percent in in and
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
so those are those those again
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
additional five to 10 million is really
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
not going to change the calculation is
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
really when you go about that is is when
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
it becomes a little significant and th
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh our debt levels will increase at that
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
point thank you because I remember when
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
I asked two years ago that very same
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
question about well what if it goes to 6
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
point whatever percent and and the the
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
number was huge to that you had to do to
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
to do that so I just wanted to get that
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
out there um any other members of the
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
committee representative
Jack

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
Jack
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
than the of La extension in this budget
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of La extension in this
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
budget is substantially more than what
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
it normally is which means that we're
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
not retiring as much by the as we
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
normally would assum you've taken that
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
into account as
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
well I'm very sorry I couldn't I
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear the
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
question the am the amount of laps
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
extension in this budget is
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
substantially more than what it has been
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
in past
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
budgets and that means that not as much
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
bonded indebtedness is getting retired
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
as would normally be retired I I would
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
assume you taking that into account in
 
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.110 align:start position:0%
assume you taking that into account in
your

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation yes all of that is taking
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
into account we are we are in in the in
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
the in the Deb um de affordability study
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
we include um you know we assume the new
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
debt that we are be initiative each year
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
we also remove the retire debt and and
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
we also um you know the the final study
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
is going to show you um it's going to
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
show you additional um sensitivities
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
that that we prepare we we include uh
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
stay guaranteed um that the state is um
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
guarantees for um the business Finance
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
Authority for for um um for peace so you
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
will see um you know all of the
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
sensitivities that we include in that
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
study so it's a more robust
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive study so the the basic um
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
case base that we call we we do include
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
those are the basic um um you know
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
components of the calculation adding the
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
new debt um retiring and paying off the
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
debt and how we are able to um again the
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
state's policy is that we try to pay 60%
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the debt um in the first 10 years and
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
the other 40% in the other 10 years so
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a conservative um um and
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
beneficial way to pay off debt and and
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
calculation representative
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
fer yes thank you for than the question
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the ratio of Debt Service to
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
revenue could you explain what Revenue
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
goes into the denominator and how
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
sensitive changes in tax revenue might
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
be to that that
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
number thank you great question it is
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue uh what we use so
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
any changes in revenue and decreases in
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
ratio any other members of the committee
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
either in the room or ending remotely if
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
you're attending remotely if you would
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
um hit the uh raise hand button it
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%

there waving your hand especially if
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%

watch 9:59 we have 10 o'clock with the

governor's budget director but since
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
these are simply presentations I think
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to go straight
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%

talk about the priorities that was used
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
by the governor and his office and
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
establishing who got what in the capital
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
budget if you could start there it would
 
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.590 align:start position:0%
budget if you could start there it would
be

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%

virtually um and I look forward to your
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
questions on the governor's capital
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
budget as introduced uh and also thank
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
you to uh state treasurer
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
State treasure state treasurer mapelli
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
for her presentation this morning as
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
well um you did note Mr chairman the
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget as introduced does
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
exceed the recommendation of 120 million
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
um but we do not expect uh any more than
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
nominal impacts uh based on the debt
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
affordability analysis the treasury has
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
conducted uh and we do feel comfortable
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
at the level that we've put forward uh
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
as you can see from the materials that
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
the LBA has provided the committee the
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
governor does recommend $17 million in
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
new general fund Capital
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
Appropriations this combined with the
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that were delineated in
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
hb25 from 2019 uh for the 2223 bium
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
bring that total to $125 million in
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um one thing I do want to
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
note is this budget
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
includes $40 million in IT projects
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is uh somewhat higher than we've
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
seen in the past and I think this
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
underscores the state's commitment uh to
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that the state and state
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
employees have the resources uh
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
especially in light of covid and our
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
aging it infrastructure systems uh to
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can continue
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
operations uh even in light of a
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic and these issues are things
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
that have come to light in past year and
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
projects that were prioritized to
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
need uh additionally um as I'm sure Mr
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
chairman you know and for the benefit of
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
other members on the committee uh there
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
is one erroneous appropriation in hb25
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
and the materials that you have relative
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
to the Hudson CTE Center um as this
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee has put forward uh legislation
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
last session outside of
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
hb25 that did fund uh that $2.5 million
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that project that was
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
originally scheduled for FY
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
2223 um what I will say about the
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
process is that these projects have been
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
scored both by administrative services
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
in the department of it uh where
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh and through our
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
consultative process identifying the
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
greatest needs for the state whether it
 
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
be to ensure that our systems are secure
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
um or ultimately providing those most
 
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
um or ultimately providing those most
essential

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
Services uh we did put forward a
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
pre-selected list of projects uh which
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
is what you see in the 2021 Capital
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan booklet that I'm sure
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
you have all received and then from
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
there working with each agency having
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
detailed conversations about those
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
projects where the areas of greatest
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
need were uh and funding as many
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
projects as we could uh at a level that
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
we felt comfortable putting
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
forward of course course this budget
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
can't fund every
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
request but we have prioritized those
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
projects that either have the greatest
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
return on investment uh address critical
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
needs have the longest useful life um
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what you see before
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
you one consideration that I do want to
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
point out for the committee our ongoing
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
conversations in Washington DC regarding
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
potential money uh for state and local
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
governments uh ultimately those
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
conversations have not factored in to
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
hb25 as presented given the timing uh
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't have certainty that a a
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
bill would pass or B what the Contours
 
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
of that bill would look like but that is
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
something that this committee will have
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
to address if and when uh a potential uh
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
legislative package does move forward in
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and if there's money that
 
00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919 align:start position:0%
is flexible for one-time infrastructure
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
projects here in the state of New
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um given that timing there is
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
one appropriation in House Bill 2 that
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
would prioritize those federal dollars
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
and that is for the forensic hospital
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
that was originally partially funded in
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 4 uh from
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
2019 and we have carried that forward
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
into uh House Bill two as
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
introduced uh this year as well one
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
other note that I do want to make that
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
currently exists in House Bill 2 but may
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate to shift to House
 
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.110 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate to shift to House
Bill

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
25 is a lapse of capital Appropriations
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
relative to projects at the department
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
of safety and what the department has
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
brought forward and I'm sure they will
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
have additional conversations with the
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee as well is to reappropriate
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
those laps dollars to complete the state
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
police hanger project uh jointly with
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
with the Department of military Affairs
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
and veteran services uh so just wanted
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the committee is aware
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
um of that in hb2 which I know is not uh
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
formally introduced from OS at this
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
point in
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
time um just to comment on on some of
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
the questions just one question on House
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
Bill two on the psychiatric
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
hospital inhouse bill two as as the
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
governor has sent it to the legislature
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll see it eventually um is that
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
bonded money and if so how much is that
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
bonding for so that question and I think
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
the language will make this clear once
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's released uh essentially would
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
prioritize federal dollars if those
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
federal dollars become available it
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
would be the intent to pay for that
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
project in cash the way we had made
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
original Appropriations two years ago um
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
but it does include a provision that
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
should uh federal funds not be available
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
or that the department cannot identify
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
other options to fund that
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation it would fault or default
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
back to a a bonded Capital appropriation
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
um but there are several conditions that
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
that would come into play before we get
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
to that point Mr
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman oh and the total amount I
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
apologize if I didn't mention that is
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
were you were you finish with your
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
presentation or I I you at that point
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
but no worries Mr chairman the only
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
other thing I would mention um the
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
lapses and one of the representatives
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
had a various St question given covid we
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
have seen some capital projects get
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
shifted um or continue to see extensions
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
um that an important consideration for
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
the committee and it's great to hear
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
that those questions are already being
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
raised uh for the treasurer um and
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
similarly we do see an opportunity given
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
the low cost of debt where we are today
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
to make strategic
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
Investments um while staying within
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
those thresholds that have been
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
identified by the rating agencies and
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
even though we do exceed that $120
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
Million number we feel that the market
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
conditions are favorable to make those
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
types of Investments today while also
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that there may be one-time
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
Federal money on the horizon um but
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
again that's a question that that the
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
governor's phase really couldn't address
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
because of the ongoing uncertainty there
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
but with that I'm happy to take any
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee I I have one and it deals with
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
um the community colleges as well as the
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
University system when I look at the
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
numbers that are being proposed for both
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
of those um systems it looks like all
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
you have done is give propose giving
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
them the money that was promised in the
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
last uh bium in House Bill 25 of
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
2019 is there any
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
reason um that you cut it off at just
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
well we'll give you what we promised
 
00:36:26.839 --> 00:36:28.190 align:start position:0%
well we'll give you what we promised
before

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
um and leave it at that um rather rather
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
than looking at uh current needs as
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question Mr
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and it's great to be talking
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
about the university and the community
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
college system because obviously our
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
commitment uh to those systems as they
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
exist today and as the governor has
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
proposed in his budget to unify the
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
boards in year one of this bium and then
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
combine their funding in year two um
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
that is certainly something that did
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
factor into our
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
conversations uh not to say that there
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
aren't emergent or new needs that have
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
Arisen past uh the Appropriations that
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
were made in fiscal year 2019 but given
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
the size and the magnitude of what we're
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
proposing to do with the boards we
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that those decisions
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
could be made by that unified system as
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
they weigh their priorities
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
um in a unified manner as opposed to
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
each independent board or system
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
bringing forward those recommendations
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
so that is certainly something that came
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
into our conversation um there may be
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the committee to fund
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
some of those projects that were
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
presented in this cycle um and some of
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
them do have Merit but it is important
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
to consider that when we talk about
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
unifying the boards and merging the
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
systems some of those factors do need to
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and this is a hypothetical if that
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
unification does not happen then both of
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
the systems
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
have lost two years of Capital
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
Improvements by uh we hope this happens
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
true I I would say that you know there
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
are considerations to be had there Mr
 
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I think we're confident that
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
those conversations will progress and we
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
really do approach this as an
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
inevitability that these are Alles that
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
systems across the country are facing
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
and rather than wait for that crisis to
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
manifest itself we want to do this in a
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
strategic Manner and given that if it
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
were not to happen it is true that two
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
years would have gone by but weighing
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
the pros and cons of that approach
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
versus the opportunity that really does
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
exist um coming out of this opportunity
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
to unify the systems we see that as a
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
stronger benefit that will put that new
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
combined New Hampshire college and
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
university system on the best footing uh
 
00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:07.390 align:start position:0%
university system on the best footing uh
going

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
forward questions from other members of
 
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.430 align:start position:0%
forward questions from other members of
the

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee um I see no hands raised
 
00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.630 align:start position:0%
committee um I see no hands raised
either

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
um I do have one other um I thought
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
somebody would ask it looking through
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
here um how much of the goal was also to
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
maximize um Federal matching funds for
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
for all of these as as you presented
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
there you know in De the military and
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
Veterans um the veterans home all of
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
those have um federal dollars that are
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
that can be matched or or are totally
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
Federal how much of that entered into
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
your factor of what projects got uh
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
approved or not approved at at the
 
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.150 align:start position:0%
approved or not approved at at the
governor's

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
level thank you Mr chairman and that's a
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
a great question to consider and
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
certainly something that did come into
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
our scoring uh the opportunity to
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
leverage out outside dollars uh to build
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
projects I think that as you mentioned
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
those agencies also places like HHS um I
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
will say there are projects that were
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
proposed that would have leveraged
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that did not make it in
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
um to the governor's uh version of the
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget as introduced uh one
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
notable project would be uh the Canon
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
Mount Tramway uh which would leverage
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
federal land and water conservation fund
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh monies um so that is not included it
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
would be an opportunity to further
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
leverage those funds um but certainly a
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
factor that we we did consider Mr
 
00:40:51.079 --> 00:40:59.910 align:start position:0%
factor that we we did consider Mr
chairman

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
questions May you're really getting off
 
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
questions May you're really getting off
light

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
light
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
today but I'm sure that you will be back
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
at some point as we begin our our
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
deliberations on what to include or not
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh include in the in the governor's
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
proposal or changes there too the final
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
question that I have because I've heard
 
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.750 align:start position:0%
question that I have because I've heard
from

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
couple of agencies already about we want
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
to make changes to um the governor's uh
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
proposal how closely did
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
you as the budget director work with
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
agency heads or their staff to make sure
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
that they understood what was going into
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
the capital budget before it was sent
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
over to the
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislature uh so we did have
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
conversations uh with agencies
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
especially projects that the governor
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
had further questions on beyond the
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
detail that was provided uh in the blue
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
booklet from Das um I will say uh we
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have a conversation with every
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
single agency especially if their
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
projects were either well explained
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
initially um but we do understand that
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
changes do happen and then some of those
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
priorities have shifted and I'm sure
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from some of those agencies
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
today um so we have heard from those
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
agencies as well uh we certainly want to
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
support their requests um as presented
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
and were appropriate uh consider and and
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
work with them on what their revisions
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
might be um and to your point Mr
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm more than happy to come
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
back anytime the committee does have
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions um but I do appreciate a light
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
first day so thank you all for that
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
there is still time to change that I
 
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:55.230 align:start position:0%
there is still time to change that I
will

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
say see no hands raised either in the
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
room or those attending uh
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
remotely um I thank you Matt and I'm
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
sure that we will be talking um
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
especially as we start making changes
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
and you want to know what we're doing as
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
well as the governor I'm sure um and and
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
there will be questions I know about
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
thinking uh and most of those should be
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
answered by the agencies but we shall
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
you all right for the members of the
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
committee I have 105
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
1014 um our next presentation is not
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
until 10:30 and is Department of
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and as you just
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
heard from the budget director there's
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
$40 million of it work in this budget um
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
which is why he is the first one up for
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
the agencies because it cuts across a
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
lot of the agencies but um the house
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
does work on schedules and we have a 15
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%

00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
the time 10:30 if everybody could mute

themselves if you're not
 
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.230 align:start position:0%

00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
of Information
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner is on um
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%

the record my name is Dennis goule I'm
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for the Department of
 
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.309 align:start position:0%

Technology um I'm hoping that the um
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
presentation materials that that we sent
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
hands I believe most of everybody got
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
them um if not they can find them at the
 
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
lb's web
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
page so I'll jump right in um starting
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
on the second page we have um three
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
items that that we're requesting for
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
this this period um the first one is
 
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.910 align:start position:0%
this this period um the first one is
cyber

00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
cyber
 
00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.789 align:start position:0%
cyber
security

01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
security
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
um and the second one is for cloud
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
services and the third one is for
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
continuity of operations and Disaster
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
Recovery planning I have a page a
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
summary page for each one so I will move
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
now to P page
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
three and our first priority which is a
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
cyber security program
 
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
enhancement um if you look back to
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
previous um capital budget requests
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
requesting um capital for cyber security
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
um each banm I think this may be the
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
fourth bium in a row and sadly I don't
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
expect that to change uh the the the uh
 
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
bad guys keep getting better at things
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we keep having to adapt so um we we
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
have some new initiatives uh that we're
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
looking at um this year looking forward
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
I should say to the next
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
uh couple fiscal years
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
um one is uh the first item is to um we
 
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:10.039 align:start position:0%
we've enhanced some of our tooling um
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
with the with the last um budget request
 
01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:17.559 align:start position:0%
in the last banian and that allows us to
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
to get deeper into what's happening with
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
our applications from a cyber security
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
perspective and um so what we're what
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing there is um number one
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
really is is going deeper into the
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
number of systems that we're able to
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
Monitor and
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
analyze keep track of how data is being
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
used and whether it's being used
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
correctly or misused so it's kind of a
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
high Lev view of that I could really I
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
could probably spend an entire hour just
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
on that one bullet in terms of the types
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
of things we we would be doing um but
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
I'll just give you a small example there
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
um we're actually right now for vaccine
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
management we are looking at log file
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
data that's created by the systems and
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
analyzing that data to look for bad
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
things happening we know that we've
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
heard from the um um from our federal
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
partners that there's there's credible
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
threats that um you know the um folks
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
would uh folks who do ransomware would
 
01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
try to monetize by taking down
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
vaccination systems so we be out Extra
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
Care on that particular thing and we'd
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
like to expand that in the next bium to
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
many more important systems in the state
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
um second item is really um improving
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
the way we um we validate and identify
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
users across the state systems so that
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
we do it in a in a much more secure way
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
um in a much more consistent way across
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
systems um and then finally um we during
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
the early days of the pandemic we did
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
Implement um New Edge uh Computing
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
equipment to deal with the fact that um
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
we had lots more people working remotely
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
we had to upgrade all of our equipment
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly and we did put in a new um
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
intrusion protection system or
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
prevention system IPS and we implemented
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
it basically as we had our old system
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
but the new system has much more
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
capabilities than the old one and we
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
want to invest in making sure we're
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
using those
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
capabilities to to the greatest extent
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
possible so uh so that's um that's item
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
number one um I will now um I think uh
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
it might be easy to stop for questions
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
on each item if that works for the
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee so I will um I will I will ask
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
the committee now if there's any
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
questions on item
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
one um thank you commissioner I do have
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
01:03:59.780 --> 01:03:59.790 align:start position:0%
question from CHR
 
01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
question from CHR
[Music]

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
theba thank you repm Graham um I was
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
only going to offer to share the
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
presentation on the screen if that's
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
easier for members and for the
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner or they could share their
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
um document if they would like it to do
 
01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:13.390 align:start position:0%
um document if they would like it to do
it

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
directly just wanted to put that out
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
helpful I I'm having head shaking yes
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
here in the committee so if you could do
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
that it would probably be
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
helpful all right hold on one moment and
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's okay with you commissioner goule
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
or did you want to have either you or
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
Ken do it no no having you share it that
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay so everybody should see um priority
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
number two I think that's where you're
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
we're headed do you want me to go back
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
to Priority number one well let's see if
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
there's any questions on priority number
 
01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
there's any questions on priority number
one

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right hearing none I guess we
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
can go go to Priority number two I had a
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
question oh
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
excuse yes yes commissioner goule
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
um does your under under item number one
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
do you does your department have
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
anything to do with developing the
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we're we're involved in that with the
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
and public
 
01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.910 align:start position:0%
and public
health

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry could you repeat your
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
answer um we are involved are you
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the um the scheduling
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
system or the immunization management
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
system or
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
both I guess um I don't know the the V
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
I've been asked that question several
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
times by people um that's why I'm
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
bringing it up I believe it has to do
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
with the authorization that came last
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
year to get it developed and the
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
specific question to me was who's doing
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
it and when is it supposed to be
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
finished oh okay I think I know what
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about now that would be
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
the I believe that's the immunization
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
what they call the immunization
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
information system or IIs and that is
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
actually being implemented as we speak
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
by public health and there um that and
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
that was funded in I believe in I saw
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
the contract go to governor and Council
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
ago thank you you're welcome other
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you Mr chairman I just had
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it says in this information that the
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
life expectancy in this project is 10
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
years is is that realistic or is in fact
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
period um is that a question relating to
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
how we would Bond the the debt for
 
01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.029 align:start position:0%
how we would Bond the the debt for
capital

01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
or no it just says the life expect oh
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean yeah typically we put up a
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
new system system um we would expect to
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
run it for about a decade because it's a
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
pretty big investment and you need to
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
leverage it over a period of many years
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
so I I think that is realistic for the
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
most part yes I mean the stuff the cyber
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
security measures that we put in place
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
um you know a decade ago um most of them
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
are still operating today it it's a
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
layered it know we don't unfortunately
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
cyber security is you know we keep
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
adding layers and we never we never
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
remove them because we always have to
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
you know there it keeps getting more and
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
more difficult to secure our data and
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
protect ourselves so we just keep
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
layering on more protections over over
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
realistic representative
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
fauler yes thank you I think my question
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
is similar to representative Abbott uh
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be help us understand
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
how much of this in investment is going
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
to purchasing out equipment or outside
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
services and how much of it is to
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
fund um you know
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
full-time uh you know state employees
 
01:08:38.839 --> 01:08:39.590 align:start position:0%
full-time uh you know state employees
they

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
have okay thank you for the question
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
none of it is to fund
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
employees um it's all for um we have a
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
relatively small cyber group um and we
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
do sometimes uh for example last time we
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh the last by we funded a a
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive cyber risk assessment
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
which we did with outside Services which
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
were which was completed um recently
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually and so so zero for state
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
employees thank you you're
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
welcome seeing no further questions if
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
so um this this item is um during the um
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we accelerated our
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
implementation and use of technology to
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
run the business of the state and it's
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
really been helpful um we um using cares
 
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
act money we implemented um the
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
Microsoft um
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
cloud-based um collaboration suite at
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
the E3 level which I believe is what
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
both the um both the legislature and the
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
um and the courts are using as well um
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and we did it very quickly mostly to get
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
teams up and running so that the state
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
employees could collaborate and it's
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
really helped a lot um but but we have
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
much more work to do there to fully
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
realize that investment um the the
 
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
licensing for that is is in the 2223
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget and it's about
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
um depending on how you measure it's
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
about um $3.8 million a year operating
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
expense this is this would be for
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
products and services to
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
enhance um what we've already
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
implemented and make sure that we get
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
the full leverage out of uh that
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
operating expense
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
investment um the other
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
um and um what we're seeing now is a a
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
great demand in inside state agencies to
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
leverage you know now that they've had a
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
taste of this technology um and they
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
found the the U um you know the
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
improvements in Effectiveness that it's
 
01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:06.590 align:start position:0%
improvements in Effectiveness that it's
given

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
them um there's a great thirst to
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
continue and and fully leverage the
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
tools so that we can um benefit the
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
state even more particularly at this
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
time when we are so res we are resource
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
constrained um from the standpoint of
 
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing so um and again this is this
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
none of this would be for state
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
employees this would all be for products
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
and services associated with um uh cloud
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
services and digital government services
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
and when I say digital government that's
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
projecting capabilities out to Citizens
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
um uh to
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh to provide the services that we might
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.709 align:start position:0%
 
seeing

01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.719 --> 01:12:03.709 align:start position:0%
 
none

01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
on so now we'll go to Priority
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
three um so in in the previous
 
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
bium um um there was funding for um a
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
beginning to um work on improving our
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
disaster recovery and continuity of
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
operations plans um I've I've actually
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
requesting uh that for um number of
 
01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
banians and I believe last bani was the
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
first time we got some funded um the
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire does not have a
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
very good um core Disaster Recovery plan
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
for it systems so in the previous vium
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh we funded a a analysis um and I I
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
think at this point now we're we're
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
about to or already have awarded a
 
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.629 align:start position:0%
about to or already have awarded a
contract

01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
to have a company come in and study and
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
analyze our current Disaster Recovery
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
capabilities and make recommendations
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
for the for what we should be doing in
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
the future this um as we had planned as
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
the follow on to that which would then
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
begin to act
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
on the findings of the outside study or
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
the outside analysis of our Disaster
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
Recovery capabilities and what I mean by
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
that really is that our ability to
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
should we have a a physical disaster or
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
some other thing that causes our data
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
center to to be damaged we want to be
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
able to bring up critical State Services
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
as quickly as
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
possible today we have a very small
 
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
relatively small Disaster Recovery
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
capability for our Core State services
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
but it's in conquered which is
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely not best practice because you
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
know say we get a big ice storm that
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
takes out all of conquer that would take
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
out our main our main
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
capabilities as well as our um as well
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
as our backup capabilities so um and and
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I just got an update from my
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
Deputy Ken who says that U you where
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
contract is going to GNC soon on that
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
phase one so this is this is a follow on
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
to that um and I think it's really
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
important for the state particularly um
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
now as we're seeing all the more and
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
more weather events that are more and
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
more severe um you know I get nervous
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
that that we don't have this uh
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
place any questions from the committee
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
one I'm seeing none and no hands raised
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
from those who are participating
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
remotely thank you okay um so the next
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to cover is you know we
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
have we we I just shared three of our
 
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
Capital requests with with the committee
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
but you'll see lots of other technology
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
Capital requests coming before you and
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
um now I wanted to share the process we
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
go through and and many times I've been
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
asked um you know do you do you
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the agencies as they
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
develop their um their capital budget
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
requests the the answer is definitely
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
yes and this is the process that we
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
follow uh so the U you see the kind of
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
the three main
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
steps um that we look
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
for um the um step step one is really
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
the initial list um developing the first
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
round of testimony in the in the
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
governor's phase and then we do we do uh
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
vetting of all the projects you know is
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:52.950 align:start position:0%
vetting of all the projects you know is
it

01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
duplicative is there uh or uh or is
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
there maybe there's already a capability
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
that the agency didn't know about um
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental life cycle considerations is
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
it time has has the previous system been
 
01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.910 align:start position:0%
it time has has the previous system been
fully

01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
fully
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
leveraged um or maybe in our case um is
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
it Pastime like we see we often see this
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh ptime for example the Department of
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue is implementing a new Revenue
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
information system replacing a 30 plus
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
year old system so that clearly was
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
Pastime from a life cycle perspective
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
um is it in alignment in other words we
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
work on during the budget planning we
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
work with every Agency on their AG their
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
their strategic technology plans it's
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
called aitp or Agency information
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
technology plan and you know so we have
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
an expectation that their plan their
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
strategic plan and their Investments
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
would align with each other and if they
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't something's really wrong
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
there so we look at that um and then we
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
we go down even more granular um
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
criteria and if um and you can see that
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page step three
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
criteria so you know how important is it
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know is it um to the state overall
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
and is it an Enterprise or agency impact
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
so so um you know obviously something
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
that has a broader impact than just the
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
agency might be you know might be um
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
more heavily weighted than something
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's simply just for an agency um
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
is it in alignment with key things that
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
we think are important modernization of
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
government reducing complexity for you
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
know for citizens to access um their
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
services and then transparency you know
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
we like to you know you know
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
transparency is part of our information
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
technology plan so we certainly like to
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are at least and
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
keeping that as transparent as is is now
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
or more transparent from a from a
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
service and a financial perspective then
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's the feasibility and risk stuff
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
organizational Readiness so so um if a
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
if an organization for example is asking
 
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.709 align:start position:0%
if an organization for example is asking
for

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
funds um but they aren't properly
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
staffed to implement that that might
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
signal that they're really not ready and
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be more um focus on
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
getting the staff ready to implement and
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
so investing in something like that that
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
might not be appropriate um and uh and
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
legal and or political considerations
 
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
and that that you know there are things
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of because we're in
 
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
in government there are a lot of
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
considerations that go into a system
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
that go beyond just the pure technical
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
or business process stuff that you you
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
normally see in the private sector U so
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
we look at that as well and of course we
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
look at security um and that's that's
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
from from a couple of perspectives one
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
is you know the keeping the data
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
protected um um but also compliance with
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
the many standards that we have to um to
 
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
live within most of which are
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the federal
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
government um but some are not like PCI
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
for example payment card industry
 
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
standards we must be in compliance with
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
those and and so we look to make sure
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
that the project would be would be able
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
to to to at least remain compliant or
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
improve our compliance posture and then
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
finally we look at Financial
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
considerations um including um you know
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
cost reduction Revenue
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
generation uh you know of course some
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
agencies don't generate Revenue but many
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
do and then um leveraging alternate
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
funding sources for example in in you'll
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
see a lot of Health and Human Services
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
projects that are on the list um and
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
while they're they tend to be you know
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
pretty large and costly projects they
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
also have a lot of federal funding
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
leverage so that tends to that tends to
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
make them appealing both from the
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint of leveraging alternate
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
funding as well as a lot of those
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
projects tend to be focused directly on
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
citizen service so so those are the
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
criteria we we look at um when we're
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
considering the projects and we we share
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
our views with the governor and that's
 
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
how you know he uses you for the most
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
part he'll use what we're what we're
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
thinking about with respect to those to
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
make his recommendations when he passes
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
his proposed capital budget and if we go
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
to the next page page seven you will see
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
the the list of of um projects that um
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
that the governor um had had approved
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
that from the requests that were made U
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
by the agencies and one call out the the
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
priority column that's the agency
 
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
priority so you know in the um almost
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
six years that I've been in manhan and
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
state government I've seen that what I
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
call technology density increasing that
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
is more and more technology being used
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
for more and more things and the other
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
thing I'm seeing is that the
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
prioritization of these projects has on
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
average has been increasing within the
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
side the agency so when you look at how
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
many um agency prority ones there are in
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
there um it's you know it's pretty
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
striking or even twos and threes so
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's quite a lot of um
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot of um you know high
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
priority for the agency
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
projects and the rest is is just now I I
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
will call out that um there's a a dncr
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
um Communication System replacement
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
project in there oh yeah the number is
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
right there that could get increased I
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
thought maybe we had the old number the
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
original ask for that project was more
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
like in the 400,000 range now it's up to
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
700,000 that one since I mentioned it
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's I I'll use that as an example of
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
of how our the the analysis we put
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
projects through it work because as we
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
were looking at at um in the previous
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
vium as we were looking at um dnc's need
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
to upgrade their Radio Systems we also
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
knew that department of safety was
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
upgrading their radio system so rather
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
than doing it twice
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
separately we connected dncr and
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety so that um dncr is
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
now going to use uh the the core system
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
that department of safety implemented
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
and is
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
implementing um to save the state money
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
and and also um since safety has a lot
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
of expertise with these kind of systems
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
that they're actually able to help dncr
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
with their staff reducing the
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
implementation costs for their for DNC R
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
's new radio system so that's a nice
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
concrete example of how the analysis and
 
01:23:03.149 --> 01:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
and the collaboration with in between
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that we we Foster during the
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
process actually help save the state
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
money um so um that that concludes my
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
formal testimony um I'm happy to answer
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
any and all questions that you may
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
have um thank you
 
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.470 align:start position:0%
have um thank you
commissioner

01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
um I have one and it's more of a request
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
um you're obviously the first of many
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
agencies that going to come before us
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
over the next month or so and based on
 
01:23:35.239 --> 01:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
over the next month or so and based on
past

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
practices some of them will come in with
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
additional projects that they want to be
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
funded if it has to do with
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
it would you be willing to take a look
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
at them and do a quick fetting of them
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they fit into um what
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
you just explained to is your process
 
01:23:55.719 --> 01:23:57.550 align:start position:0%
you just explained to is your process
for

01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations we absolutely would
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
Mills thank you Mr chair Mr chair I
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
think you took the uh my question right
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
out of my mouth that that that was
 
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
basically my entire concern here uh you
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
know the past years we've gotten so many
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
so many it requests from different
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
departments and our our major concern
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
has always been have they been vetted by
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
the IT department and do you guys
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
actually know what's going on and it
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
appears that with this system I think uh
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
our minds are a little bit more set at
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
ease so that we can we can be assured
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
that all the budget requests have been
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
vetted by you
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
guys that that is true um we spend a lot
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
of time on this and and honestly what
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know my process and is to try to
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
improve at every VI Anyan as well so we
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
always reflect on when we're going into
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
a budget season both from a capital and
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
an operating budget perspective we like
 
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
to reflect on what we did last time and
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
try to up our gain each by Anyan in
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
terms of how you know the level of
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
information and level of discipline we
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
try to apply Financial discipline and
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
business discipline so um that's
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
something I care a lot about
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
particularly in the you know you know
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
because of the public nature and and the
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we're you know we're taking
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
monies that we collect from citizens and
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
and and spending them I think it's
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
really important that we we be really
 
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
that um there is one more thing once
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
when the questions are are complete
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
there was one more thing I wanted to
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
mention to the committee um before we
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
close so I'll just let's let the
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
questions continue I'll cover one more
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
thing if I may um I do have other
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
um member who would like to ask a
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
fker thank you um commissioner gulay for
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
your testimony I'm new to the committee
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to ask quickly um this
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
chart this final chart that summarizes
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
all the different Department's requests
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
how does it compare to the last couple
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
of years is it pretty much in line with
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
or does it bump up or down and if so
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
briefly why well that's a great question
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
question um so the we've the quantity of
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
requests that I've seen over the Bia
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
that I have been in state government are
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
about the same each year from a
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
technology perspective what varies
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
greatly this year is the amount that the
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
governor decided to fund from technology
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
versus other uh this is I think it's
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
almost double what was what was funded
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
by the governor or requested to be
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
funded by the governor in the previous
 
01:26:53.719 --> 01:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
funded by the governor in the previous
bium

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
bium
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's a recognition of the
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know the importance of technology in
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
our citizen service Mission certainly
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen in in Co that you know a lot
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
of the things we've been able to get
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
done um would not have been done had we
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
place I see no other hands raised
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner you said you had
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
a final
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
comment yes um so there was language um
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
added to in 2021 to hb25 we actually
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
didn't request the language but it
 
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
turned out to be very helpful to us in
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
covid um from a flexibility perspective
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
and and and I'll read it to you and I
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
canot send it along as well if you wish
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner of the Department of
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
Information Technology is authorized to
 
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
reallocate funds on among the projects
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
in in sub paragraphs blah blah blah blah
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
as it was in House Bill 25 as necessary
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
to complete the projects so we you know
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask for that language and um
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
but it would turned out to be very
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
helpful um during Co in the sense that
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
we could um you know um we could be very
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
responsive on the digital government
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
side helping out in various places to um
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in in the digital
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
government space but so I would I would
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
ask I I can forward that language along
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
to Chris and I would ask the committee
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
to consider adding similar language in
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
this in this time in this case if you
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
would well commissioner we don't have a
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
copy of House Bill 25 at this point it's
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
still being drafted but if you could
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
send that
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
along to to me I'll make sure that uh
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
the committee sees it and we give it due
 
01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.629 align:start position:0%
the committee sees it and we give it due
consideration

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and it may be included in what the
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed I I just none of
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
us have seen the final language of what
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
the Govern well it's it ended up in the
 
01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.590 align:start position:0%
the Govern well it's it ended up in the
previous

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
banians um House Bill 25 in 2021 and and
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
it it was a pleasant surprise for us
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
when we saw it there and I'm not sure
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
how it got in there but um I wanted to
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
just mention it and fact that having it
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire National Guard in the
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs and
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%

going off of sir just so I make sure
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
when I run down the list I'm in sync
 
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.629 align:start position:0%
when I run down the list I'm in sync
with

01:30:21.629 --> 01:30:21.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm going by what the uh Governor
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
proposed all right so I will go down the
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
list of what the governor proposed and
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
then if it's okay with you I'll go
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
through some of the items that were not
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
funded that we would like consideration
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
of all let's go through in that order um
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you heard but we've
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
heard from the treasurer already um
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
additional funding for any agency is
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to be very tough right um and so
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're at the start um but you
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
may not get much more if um if anything
 
01:31:09.550 --> 01:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
more Yep so understood um so first if
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
there's a new representative out there
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
um just to give you context for us our
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
department um uh when you look at the
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
funding General funds versus federal
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
funds generally speaking and being very
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
simplistic we have two types of
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
buildings our armories which you see 17
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
18 of them throughout the state which
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
typically have a 5050 federal state cost
 
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
share then you'll see our Aviation
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
facility in conquered you'll see some of
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
our maintenance facilities in hookit
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester conquered Hillsboro those are
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
100% federally
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursed so you look at the cost here
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
for some of our specific projects if
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's a state cost share it typically
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
affects our armories for us to sustain
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
them if it's 100% Federal um it's just
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know competing against federal
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to get the money into the
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
state and just then fixing or
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
refurbishing some of those federally
 
01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.750 align:start position:0%
refurbishing some of those federally

of the six items that were approved in
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%

correct yes okay
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
so that had a 7525 federal state cost
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%

like fencing um curbs some parking um
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
that was a 7525 federal state cost share
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
of which we can do some of those uh

projects that were
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
approved I would like to address one
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
change that I addressed in a memo to the
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
committee and that's changing item one
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
anti-terrorism force protection marac
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
County we would like to move those funds
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
to 4 $15,000 of General funds to another
 
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.030 align:start position:0%
to 4 $15,000 of General funds to another

01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
project the reason why is because prior
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent to us submitting this budget
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
submission National Guard Bureau
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
approved of an exception to policy to
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
allow us to utilize 100% federal funds
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
on this specific
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
project so those
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
$415,000 of General funds we would like
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
to move to a general Readiness Center
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
um project Statewide that allows us to
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide so those are the six items
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the governor's Capital project were
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
approved that is the reason why we want
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
to move those General
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
funds what do I now like to address is
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
what we didn't get and I understand
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
trust me with 800 soldiers and Airmen
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
activated throughout the state in covid
 
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
another two to 300 soldiers Airmen
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
employed we understand the uh the fiscal
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
environment that states
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
in we're our organization assumes risk
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
um is the fact that none of these
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
projects provide us any general funds
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
for our 17 armories throughout the state
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire for the next two years
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
when our oldest Armory is 1880 our
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester Armory is 1932 and the rest
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
of our facilities are Cold War era
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
facilities both in the 50s and 60s 0 to
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
17 armories that total 400,000 square ft
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
of office space there's a significant
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
amount of risk there we do not have any
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
funds in the current budget to replace
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
any roof leak or any boiler
 
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
failure those same armories are being
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
used for PPE warehousing and
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
distribution we use them for covid
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
testing we're using them now for
 
01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.109 align:start position:0%
testing we're using them now for
vaccination

01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
support um that's our Challenge and
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's why I'd like to discuss two
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
project s that are not in the governor's
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
budget that we are sort of uh asking for
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
your support
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
for sir would you like me to continue
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
then with those two two items go
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
ahead so there's two items um you know
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
that were not funded that had a cost
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
share right a 5050 cost share one of
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
them was titled Readiness Center
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
renovation Statewide 1.2 million 600,000
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
General funds 600,000 federal funds 5050
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
State cost share that 415k we would like
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
to be moved into that
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
account that it will allow us as a
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
minimum to at least replace one roof and
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
one boiler during the next two
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
years the it other item that was not
 
01:38:13.149 --> 01:38:13.159 align:start position:0%
addressed in my memo to you would be to
 
01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
ask the uh committee's um you know I
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
guess leniency or support on getting
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
what's called Energy resiliency and
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency Statewide
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
so I discussed the one that was for
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
buildings that are 100% federally
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursed but we also have another
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
project of the same name and topic for
 
01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:33.229 align:start position:0%
project of the same name and topic for
our

01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%

01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
General funds 875,000 federal funds any
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
funds in that account would be
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
appreciated um you know bottom line for
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
us is it's a great budget it's a great
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
start it allows us to sustain our
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
federally reimburse
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
facilities it does not not allow us to
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
sustain our 17 armories throughout the
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
state which with an average age of
 
01:39:08.189 --> 01:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
1950 uh subject to your questions is

County sir it's most likely going to be
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
Berlin um we had to make a decision in
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the North Country we have two armies up
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%

01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
um resources we decided to close our
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
Lancaster Armory and transfer to the
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
and we will keep Berlin Armory and we're
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
just looking at you know aspirational
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get additional funds to
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
sustain that in the long
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
you do I see any other question I have
 
01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
one General on moving you do not need
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
that 415,000 that was there for the
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
antiterrorism at maram County if we were
 
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:27.159 align:start position:0%
to move adust that into
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
um what you were talking about the 1.2
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
million if we give you 4115 can you
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
match that with federal funds of 415 and
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
get something done or is that just all
 
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
on us no we can match it that's what I'm
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
telling you any dollar you give us in
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
general funds will be matched at least
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
by one to one or uh 7525 so uh you know
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge for us is um
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know if you think about it uh we
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
have 70 to 80 buildings uh just under a
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
million square feet of office space
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
3,000 soldiers and Airmen plus or minus
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
and uh almost everything we do has a
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
federal match so any dollar you give us
 
01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:13.719 align:start position:0%
is going to be matched uh you know so I
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
mean yeah we'll double down so any
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
dollar you give us is going to be match
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
with a an equal federal state federal
 
01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.430 align:start position:0%
with a an equal federal state federal
match

01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
and and just so that as we're looking at
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to go along with any of this
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation it would be um titled
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
ready to send a re renovation
 
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide um whatever the the general
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
fund and then the federal fund matching
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
as well yes sir
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.589 align:start position:0%
yes thank
you

01:41:51.589 --> 01:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
El uh yes thank you Mr chairman uh I'm
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
just going to go on record as saying
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
that when we do when we start uh
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
discussing this in committee and we do
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
our little up and downs on everything
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make the recommendation to
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
add on to that 415,000 to bring it up to
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
600,000 for the uh for their original
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
request for priority number four uh
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's less than $200,000
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
and and in a budget decize I think it
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
will be well spended thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mills if you
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
could convince um 12 people on this
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee to go along with you we will
 
01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.070 align:start position:0%
committee to go along with you we will
do

01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
it any other hands
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
raised see
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
none oh representative Edgar I missed
 
01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
none oh representative Edgar I missed
that

01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
Mike thank you uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
I see that there's a difference between
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
what we received in February and the
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
great big bound book we got in
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
December um it looks like maybe some of
 
01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
the priorities changed uh do you have
 
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
any comment to that uh
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
General Sir what I think happened is we
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
proposed 10 priorities
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh five of them with a uh general fund
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
match and I believe what transpired
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
through the governor's budget is they
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
they funded six of our 10 projects so
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm assuming is the
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
difference in um the the listing
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
priorities between the past and the
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
present chairman was am I
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
correct um pretty much um if you look at
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
um the as as one of our members tells it
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
the wishbook that went to the governor
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
the the blue the blue book that we all
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
have and what was actually in his
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
proposal sent to us you'll see that many
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
agencies the the listing is different
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
but the projects are all right um so I'm
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
not sure if it was just um the staff
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
going okay we're gonna do all six and
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
just put them down in whatever order
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
they they wrote them or what but they're
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
all there so okay um and I'm not sure we
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
didn't ask uh the budget director if the
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
the priorities that are in the
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal or the governor's
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
not okay if I could just uh if I could
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um there was also a land
 
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
listed originally in the uh the blue
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
book that we got did but the totals are
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
the same and the other items are the the
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
same was there anything unusual about
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
that did you get the land some other way
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
no a Ser we'll accept the risk um
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
usually what we'll do is every budget
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
cycle or every other budget cycle we
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
usually put in it's the state's
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide us with land
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
so we can build new
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
armories we understand in the current
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal requirement asking for a half
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds with no
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
federal match probably isn't going to
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
work and
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
so with prior bium budget freeze
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
releasing some funding we have remaining
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
from Land um that should be sufficient
 
01:45:35.310 --> 01:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
for us to use uh use and try to get
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
after what we need you know so you know
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
why we need so much some of these
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
General funds in this current budget
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
cycle when I tell you that you we have
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
17 armories and zero funding for them
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
for the next two years I can look the te
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
leaves and tell you that two years from
 
01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.870 align:start position:0%
leaves and tell you that two years from
now

01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
um if you and I are still here I will be
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
asking you for my number one priority
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
will be $5 million of General funds to
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
match a $15 million um Federal Armory
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be building in
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
2027 so I you know so like we're always
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
trying to you know get the land today
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
for five years out and what we'll
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
essentially do is you know with funds
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
that were're just released uh um from
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
the current budget frees we will use
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
those to get the next sort of future big
 
01:46:24.589 --> 01:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
milcon project to bring them to the
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
state so that's why we it was our number
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
one priority then Co hit then we said
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know what this this won't work so
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's why we I'm not advocating for it
 
01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:33.870 align:start position:0%
that's why we I'm not advocating for it
right

01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
up it was um represent Graham all I was
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to do was just uh help clarify
 
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
some of the various documents that
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
people may have looked at or maybe have
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
in front of them um and if I could if I
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure and representative bunker I I do
 
01:47:07.629 --> 01:47:07.639 align:start position:0%
know your hand is up so so right now
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking at um this is the summary
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
list from the what I would call the the
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
the fat binder from the June meeting
 
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
where the capital budget is presented
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
for the to the
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
governor and in that um you had 10
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
projects for the Department of military
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services and those
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
are listed here and you can see the land
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
you can see the reference to number four
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the um General was me uh discussing
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
of these 10 projects that were there in
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
June seven made it into that blue bound
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
book that you were mailed the it's
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
called 2021 Capital Improvement
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
program and during that process there
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
may be some adjustments to the amounts
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
that you see in that book compared to
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
this page that I have on the U in on the
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
screen because the uh Public Works
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
division within administrative services
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
will look at the various projects and
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
try to um get a better handle on what
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
the cost might
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
be and then the last piece that you have
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
right now is the recommended Governor's
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
capital budget which is that gray thin
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
book and in there there were six
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
projects for the for the department so
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
the the land one is um was identified
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%

department or going forward um that's
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
one place you can look if it's not in
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
the blue book so that's all I just
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to help the committee with that

needs of the New Hampshire veterans home
 
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
over the next bium um for the record my
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
name is Margaret Le and I'm the commant
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire veterans home um as
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
you can see from my presentation and
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
from the governor's uh capital budget um
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
there are two vital needs at the New
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans home at this point um
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
the parking lot repairs and
 
01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure although it may not sound
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
like um a needed project truly um is our
 
01:58:54.510 --> 01:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
um mission to make sure that our staff
 
01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
and visitors are able to get into the
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home in a safe manner currently
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
we have many uh cracks and um divots
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the parking lot area that
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
makes it um very hard for our um
 
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
visitors especially those who are
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
handicapped to transverse into the
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
veterans home um and we have areas
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the um area it's called the
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
lot e that is an unimproved dirt parking
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
lot that during winter time many of our
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
staff need to park out there in order
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the other parking lots to be cleared
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
of snow and
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
debris and um to pave that would add to
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
the security and safety of them to get
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
into the building um so I um in the
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
parking lot just walking around it you
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
can tell I walked around it with the
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
public works uh gentleman when he was um
 
01:59:49.390 --> 01:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
here it happened to be raining that day
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
and literally you would see the water um
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
just puddling around the building and um
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
where the cvet was almost two inches
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
above where the pavement is um creating
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
trip and um fall hazards that we feel
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
that absolutely needs to be corrected
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
and so we um look for your um support on
 
02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.030 align:start position:0%
and so we um look for your um support on
that

02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:12.040 align:start position:0%

n thank you uh again the Master Plan
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
update um our last master plan was done
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
in 2010
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
2011 and um so we would like to make
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
sure that we are updating our designs
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
and definitely the needs of um the
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities throughout the
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
state as you know with the health and
 
02:00:49.629 --> 02:00:49.639 align:start position:0%
safety guidelines especially with the um
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
the current pandemic we want to make
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
sure that our building is as safe as it
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
can be and so um with a master plan
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
looking towards what our veterans will
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
need in the future as well as any
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be that need to
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
occur throughout the building to ensure
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
that we are providing a safe um and
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
secure building um for our veterans in
 
02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:14.109 align:start position:0%
secure building um for our veterans in
the

02:01:14.109 --> 02:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
future thank you I do have one question
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
about that one and maybe the other one I
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
I know that the VA helps fund part of
 
02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
your operations yes sir is there any
 
02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
potential for us being able to use
 
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds for either of these
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
projects um my review of the regulations
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
that support um they they support
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
building repairs um I have not found a
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
regulation that allows um land repairs
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
for federal
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
support and a master plan so
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
comes what they to have I would hope
 
02:01:59.310 --> 02:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
that they would help pay for it um I'm
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
going forward I will definitely look
 
02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
into that especially where um the
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic comes into place I would um
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
definitely submit this forward um if the
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
monies were secured on our end um they
 
02:02:14.189 --> 02:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
do require that the general fund portion
 
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
be secured um prior to their
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
approval thank any other questions at

this um end of this fiscal year um and
 
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
will be coded as such the first project
 
02:08:38.669 --> 02:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
that I have um is the building firewall
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
repairs was originally 1.4 million uh
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
currently stands at approximately a
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
little under 1.3 now that is the
 
02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
firewall that needs to be repaired into
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
the Leo portion of our building and as
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
you can see that that's almost 2,000
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
linear square feet of um
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
repairs um once that is done we're
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
hoping that our contractors will be able
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
to get back into the building now that
 
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
the community spread is down and those
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
repairs can be completed if that project
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
is completed by the end of June that too
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
and all um expenditures made we will uh
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
lapse those funds as well and coat it to
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
close the next one I have is the heat
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
pump equipment replacement and as you
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
know um our Leo building and the tar
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
buildings is aging the um geothermal um
 
02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
placement um of approximately 146 of
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
these heat pumps um over the years we
 
02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
have many that um are failing due to
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
their life um useful life cycle having
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
long passed uh so we appreciate um and
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
ask that those funds are able to go
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
forward as well I will tell you
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
contractors have been in areas that are
 
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
non-residential when they're able to to
 
02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:55.559 align:start position:0%
do any kind of the work that they can um
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
we at this point are still not allowing
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
them into residential areas um but we're
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that going forward within the
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
next month that with the community
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
spread continuing to decline we'll be
 
02:10:10.549 --> 02:10:10.559 align:start position:0%
able to have those uh contractors in the
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
building and um have those fixed um the
 
02:10:16.589 --> 02:10:16.599 align:start position:0%
last item that has been a long-standing
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
item is the Leo third floor Edition um
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
that has yet to be um approved on the VA
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
side so it has not um I would call
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
bubbled up on their
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
queue and um I believe approximately
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
three $300,000 have been spent on the
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
design of that building uh with the new
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
covid it may be something that we would
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to look at and see if that truly
 
02:10:44.189 --> 02:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
still um stands as the most current
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
design that we should go forward with I
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
will tell you they are all single rooms
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
and have single bathrooms which is
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
something that has was um recommended as
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have gone through this pandemic um so
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is one of the pluses of that
 
02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
addition we would move away from two
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
veterans in one room and the veterans
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
would be able to be individually and
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
single uh single rooms which we have
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
found um is beneficial to the uh spread
 
02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.109 align:start position:0%
found um is beneficial to the uh spread
of

02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
infection and I will stop there sir and
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
um answer any questions you may have
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.549 --> 02:11:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
none and that's it com that thank you
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
all I appreciate your support for our
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
veterans in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
and for everything that you do for us
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
have a great
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted I'll take you through
 
02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
to our website so that the committee
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
knows exactly where the documents are so
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
again so right now you should be seeing
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
homepage if you scroll down and on the
 
02:12:19.069 --> 02:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
left hand
 
02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
side in that column the from the bottom
 
02:12:23.709 --> 02:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
you see legislative budget
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
assistant click into that and that
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
brings you to our homepage for the
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant and across
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
the top you have home budget division
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
audit division and about us hover over
 
02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
budget division in the third one down
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
that says budget and revenue
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
documents you click on that and you're
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
going to see um a page pop up and in the
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
middle of that page it says operating
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
and capital budget documents and if you
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.229 --> 02:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
223 you're going to have you're going to
 
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
find it's going to have all the
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
operating budget documents but it's also
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
going to have all the capital budget
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
documents and you'll find the capital
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
budget documents at the bottom at this
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
time and you're going to see um Capital
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
budget- house so any document that um
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're receiving from agencies will be
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
found here um when we prepare a um
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
comparison sheet for you we'll put a pdf
 
02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
version of that that up on this um site
 
02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
as well but everything that you find
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
here is something that you would have
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
been emailed from
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
me so if there's any questions as you go
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
forward you're like I can't find a
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
certain document look here or if you
 
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
thought you should have gotten an email
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
and didn't please email me and let me
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
know um there are some things that
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go on this like the um summary
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
document for the uh June work I have not
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
been able to get permission to put that
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
on our website
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
um we tried to get the documents um for
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
the blue book that be that have that
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
available um electronically and
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
administrative Services hasn't given me
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
permission to post it on our site nor do
 
02:14:06.990 --> 02:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
they have it on
 
02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
theirs um so there may be a couple of
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
documents as you go through the process
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
that don't end up on the website but for
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
the most part everything should end up
 
02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
here um you have a meeting scheduled
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
next Friday
 
02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
you should get an email from me on
 
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
Wednesday at some point during the day
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that should have all the documents
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
I've been able to acquire from the
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
agencies that are scheduled to meet on
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
Friday my effort will be to try to get
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
you things at least two days before you
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a meeting scheduled um a lot of
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
that has to do with when I received the
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
information from the
 
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
agencies for today you have everything
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
that um was provided the department of
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is scheduled for
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
this afternoon um they did not provide
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
any documents and that's why you don't
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
have anything from them so um I will try
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
to make a note of that in future emails
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
that you know here's the documents we do
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
have and these are the agencies that
 
02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:02.559 align:start position:0%
have indicated they won't provide
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
something if I know
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
that so hopefully this is helpful but I
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
I know working with Ways and Means and
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
in capital budget and trying to navigate
 
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
our website um sometimes it's a little
 
02:15:16.589 --> 02:15:16.599 align:start position:0%
confusing to find some of the
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
things um also understand this is the
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
first year that we're really putting all
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
the documents that you see down here
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually on the website and we're doing
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
that for finance we're doing that for um
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means as well so there's a lot
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
of information that we're adding to our
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
website and we're trying to get better
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
at organizing it as we move
 
02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
forward so happy to take any questions
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
share but I think most importantly is if
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%

going to talk about when we do this talk
 
03:29:38.309 --> 03:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
about the the projects project by
 
03:29:38.319 --> 03:29:39.830 align:start position:0%
about the the projects project by
project

03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
um uh and she'll talk a little bit about
 
03:29:44.910 --> 03:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
about how we select the projects that we
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
request um um you know we manage more
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
than 90 buildings and uh for multiple
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
branches of
 
03:29:55.229 --> 03:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
government um and and how we it's we do
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
our own sort of mini thing and I think
 
03:29:58.429 --> 03:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
it might be useful for some of your
 
03:30:00.870 --> 03:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
members to to at least have a refresher
 
03:30:04.510 --> 03:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
on that and and and how that happens um
 
03:30:06.189 --> 03:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
to to kind of see the thought that goes
 
03:30:10.269 --> 03:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
into it and and how we uh how we decide
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
which roofy leaks which leaky roofs are
 
03:30:16.910 --> 03:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
um are the leakiest and need the most
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
work and we'll talk about that let me
 
03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about sort of the
 
03:30:22.189 --> 03:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
process of developing a capital budget
 
03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
itself um which is I think what you want
 
03:30:27.510 --> 03:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
to get into um and how it works because
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
it it I I think it's interesting
 
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
um I was thinking this Wednesday uh uh
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
at the governor and council meeting when
 
03:30:37.269 --> 03:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
we were talking about a project and we
 
03:30:39.309 --> 03:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
ended up having a contingency on it that
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
was like you know $400 and someone said
 
03:30:44.349 --> 03:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
why is it only $400 and I said because
 
03:30:45.670 --> 03:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's all the money that's left so we
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
better hit our number um early I'm
 
03:30:51.550 --> 03:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
looking at a I'm looking at a timeline I
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
have that that we put together to sort
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
of help guide us and it gives you an
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
idea and it's for this capital
 
03:30:57.439 --> 03:30:59.030 align:start position:0%
idea and it's for this capital
budget

03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
um we send out forms to agencies in
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
February so February a year ago we sent
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
so more than a year ago at this point we
 
03:31:09.750 --> 03:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
sent forms to agencies saying get your
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
capital budget requests in together one
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the agencies that we send it to is
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
Karen because she sort of she's sort of
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
that for for this um their responses are
 
03:31:24.269 --> 03:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
due back to were due back to us April 3D
 
03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
so what you're looking
 
03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
at um comes out of requests that were
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
developed by agencies with a due date of
 
03:31:31.319 --> 03:31:32.150 align:start position:0%
developed by agencies with a due date of
April

03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
April
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
3D a while ago remember that was back
 
03:31:37.469 --> 03:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic was new and exciting
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
for all of us um uh and then we go
 
03:31:42.870 --> 03:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
through a process in June there's a
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing they're called the
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget hearings in
 
03:31:50.349 --> 03:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
State laww this is governed by RSA 9
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere 95 I think um there's a
 
03:31:54.910 --> 03:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
process about who gets invited who's
 
03:31:58.670 --> 03:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
there um we typically invite um it was
 
03:32:00.510 --> 03:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
online this year right because everybody
 
03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
was scattered to the wind um I think we
 
03:32:06.510 --> 03:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
invited the entire uh uh Public Works
 
03:32:09.309 --> 03:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
committee as it was then um some people
 
03:32:12.189 --> 03:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
were on um some people weren't I see
 
03:32:14.590 --> 03:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
seem to recall representative cluder
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
being on it who was the uh uh sitting
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairman at the time um and they ask
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions we go agency by agency and
 
03:32:25.150 --> 03:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit like the November
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
budget hearings on the operating side
 
03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
where everybody's got maybe 15 minutes
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
to talk about stuff and they go through
 
03:32:33.389 --> 03:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
their request and what they want well
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
people request all kinds of stuff and
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
some of them are emergency items and
 
03:32:39.630 --> 03:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
some of them are we'd like showers for
 
03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
the bathroom in the basement of of a
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
building which I won't name because that
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
might have been last on my list list of
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
priorities um I mean not that I don't
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
think bathrooms are good to have showers
 
03:32:53.670 --> 03:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
but when we've got a roof that's leaking
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I think we can probably do without a
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
shower in a bathroom um so that happens
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
those hearings happen at that point
 
03:33:05.150 --> 03:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
um the law requires us to make
 
03:33:07.870 --> 03:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions to the governor's office and
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
us us is a US is a funny question and
 
03:33:13.830 --> 03:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and in fact when I started somebody said
 
03:33:15.389 --> 03:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
I said who exactly is us and they're
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
like they're like I don't know it's Mike
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
Connor so Mike Connor who was Deputy
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner who retired in 2017 um
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
although he does some work for us
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
parttime because he's he's very good he
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
works for Karen um Karen is in some ways
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
her successor but other people are in
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
some ways his successor sorry um and
 
03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
Public Works is one so what happens is I
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
sit down with Ted copper um who many of
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know is the director of Public Works
 
03:33:42.670 --> 03:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
and Michelle Giuliano who's the deputy
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
director of Public Works um which is one
 
03:33:46.349 --> 03:33:46.359 align:start position:0%
of our divisions
 
03:33:48.750 --> 03:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
and we go through the lists and
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
basically you know at that point and if
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
you've seen the binders of those
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
projects it is um some of them are very
 
03:34:00.389 --> 03:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
thorough an agency knows exactly what it
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
wants to do maybe I want to build a new
 
03:34:04.110 --> 03:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
courthouse in Milford um which we
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
already did but so we're not building
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
another one but um sometimes they're not
 
03:34:10.990 --> 03:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
quite as thorough because they're very
 
03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
much in the sort of early stages of what
 
03:34:15.070 --> 03:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
they're thinking and so what they think
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost is
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
very sketchy because they they haven't
 
03:34:22.349 --> 03:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
even fully thought it through they
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
haven't sat down with the project
 
03:34:26.429 --> 03:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
manager an engineer or an architect and
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
gone through the process we go through
 
03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
and we try to rank order those what we
 
03:34:33.870 --> 03:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't know is what the and we're doing
 
03:34:36.990 --> 03:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
it for the governor um in theory this is
 
03:34:39.189 --> 03:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
all about the preparation of the
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal that you have in
 
03:34:43.630 --> 03:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
front of you the thing that that starts
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:34:49.990 --> 03:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
um basically what we do is we we um I'll
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
just tell you what we did what we did
 
03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
this year we go through and we decide
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
what's an a what's a b and what's a c
 
03:34:56.830 --> 03:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
because at some point you have this
 
03:34:59.710 --> 03:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
giant amorphous blob of projects and you
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
have to try to figure out what they are
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're helped in the process a little bit
 
03:35:06.990 --> 03:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
because uh Karen who's now way over here
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
on my screen my Brady Bunch screen keeps
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
changing um Karen has the most projects
 
03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
and um and they tend to be the ones that
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
are more the most traditionally Capital
 
03:35:21.030 --> 03:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
Budgy not just not just the Das ones but
 
03:35:22.510 --> 03:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know Corrections would fall in that
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
category too but they do kind of a rank
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
order in inside themselves going well
 
03:35:28.870 --> 03:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know the roof at you know the the
 
03:35:32.189 --> 03:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
roof on 27 Hazen really needs replacing
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the you know if we didn't
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
do the dairy Courthouse it wouldn't be
 
03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the world um that kind of
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
stuff um and so we use that but we try
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit of equity and a
 
03:35:44.189 --> 03:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh you know let's make
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure we're picking at General projects
 
03:35:49.590 --> 03:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
According to which we think our goal is
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
to identify health and safety as much as
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
we can there are political
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
considerations that we don't make
 
03:35:57.030 --> 03:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
something might be like well you know
 
03:35:58.630 --> 03:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
this is the governor's really want wants
 
03:36:02.110 --> 03:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
to work on a a new secure psychiatric
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
unit we don't know that and and frankly
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we did we wouldn't we wouldn't judge
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
based on it because our input is meant
 
03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:10.309 align:start position:0%
based on it because our input is meant
to

03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
be public worky if you will um and so we
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
do that we suggest
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
name um suggest to him broad categories
 
03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
of projects in the past occasionally
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
people have rank ordered them like one
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
through 120 which becomes very
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
subjective and a little goofy um we
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
didn't do that this year we had broad
 
03:36:33.309 --> 03:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
categories they then get back to us and
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
say I want you to estimate these
 
03:36:39.990 --> 03:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
projects um these are the ones that I
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
want to take a second stab at so the
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
giant binder that we prepare for the
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
June hearing is sort of one take on it
 
03:36:50.550 --> 03:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
then at the next level when
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're when we're preparing this um which
 
03:36:56.110 --> 03:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
I think you all have as well the capital
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
Improvement program book this is not
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
everything that every agency proposed
 
03:37:02.070 --> 03:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
right this isn't that's an important
 
03:37:04.830 --> 03:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
note to make um because in theory the
 
03:37:07.229 --> 03:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
governor could go off of this list
 
03:37:07.239 --> 03:37:10.389 align:start position:0%
governor could go off of this list
the

03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
2017 budget debates I was the governor's
 
03:37:15.150 --> 03:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
budget director I wasn't here um and we
 
03:37:17.189 --> 03:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
actually picked a project off the list
 
03:37:21.189 --> 03:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
that was um that was not in this book um
 
03:37:23.950 --> 03:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
and and I only got wind of it from an
 
03:37:27.189 --> 03:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
agency we did a we did the library Union
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
catalog at cultural resources instead of
 
03:37:33.070 --> 03:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
the archaeology something or the other
 
03:37:34.389 --> 03:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
because the guy who was running it at
 
03:37:36.110 --> 03:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
the time really wanted the union catalog
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
and he didn't understand why we didn't
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
do it and he was really nice so we did
 
03:37:42.670 --> 03:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
it um and then I think you you guys even
 
03:37:46.510 --> 03:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
agreed um anyway so this comes out what
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
is this these are the projects that so
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
Michelle and
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
Ted assign each project Karen says to
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
them we need to redo the the roof on
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
Philbrook it's actually not one this
 
03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
year but um I think it's going to cost a
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
100 Grand or whatever um it then gets
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
assigned by by Ted and Michelle to one
 
03:38:14.110 --> 03:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
of the uh what we call Project managers
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
at Public Works they're architect and
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
Engineers we try to assign it to
 
03:38:20.030 --> 03:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who kind of knows that area you
 
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
know if it's related to a prison Tim
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
Smith ends up getting it that kind of
 
03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:25.150 align:start position:0%
Smith ends up getting it that kind of
thing

03:38:25.150 --> 03:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:38:30.189 --> 03:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
um Dave gou does mechanical etc etc um
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
they then go through an estimating
 
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
process where they they try to figure
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
out if what the agency thinks about its
 
03:38:39.070 --> 03:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
project is right in a big picture sense
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about estimating a
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
ton of projects in a few
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
weeks um that that Pro that document is
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
due to the governor um by I think
 
03:38:53.550 --> 03:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
December 1st so at that point we are we
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
are producing what we refer to as the
 
03:38:59.670 --> 03:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
book um or the CIP book and and present
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
it to the governor in theory then what
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
the governor does and that this is
 
03:39:06.429 --> 03:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
happening behind the curtain a curtain
 
03:39:09.630 --> 03:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
that I didn't look behind this year um
 
03:39:11.910 --> 03:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
but uh he's then going through that
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
going yeah I guess that makes sense and
 
03:39:15.150 --> 03:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know about that roof and do we
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
really need four cour houses how about
 
03:39:18.510 --> 03:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
we just build two and I want to make
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
sure we do something on this and like oh
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know what we got to do that thing
 
03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the University system that kind of
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
stuff and so then he puts together a
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
capital budget but the estimates that
 
03:39:31.070 --> 03:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
he's using in the capital budget are
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
coming out of this book um there have
 
03:39:36.750 --> 03:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
been years in the past where
 
03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:38.030 align:start position:0%
been years in the past where
occasionally

03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
Governors do things with the estimates
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
like they kind of make up their own mind
 
03:39:45.550 --> 03:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
um about whether
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
they were estimated well or not I
 
03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
believe that this year for the most part
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
they were um adopted that is to say that
 
03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
the the estimate that is in the capital
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
budget comes out of the blue book that
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
you all have um that's kind of the big
 
03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:00.950 align:start position:0%
you all have um that's kind of the big
picture

03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
on how we got where we are
 
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
today um and I I could stop and answer
 
03:40:10.429 --> 03:40:10.439 align:start position:0%
questions on that or or maybe jump to
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
Karen what do you what would you like to
 
03:40:14.710 --> 03:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
do Mr chairman um are there any
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions on on the process of how we
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
got to where we are
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
today see no hands up we'll jump to
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
where you want to go and if we could as
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
I said earlier just go down the way the
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
governor laid it out in his proposal if
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
we could stop at the end of each of the
 
03:40:36.510 --> 03:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
sections you know for example at the end
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
of Court facilities take questions at
 
03:40:41.469 --> 03:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
the end of each of that rather than on
 
03:40:43.469 --> 03:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
each project as she's
 
03:40:46.990 --> 03:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
talking good so I'll let Karen tell you
 
03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
everything that she knows and and the
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
advantage there is that she's the smart
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
one well with that introduction thank
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
you yes hi I'm Karen rantamaki I am the
 
03:40:59.189 --> 03:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
director of plant and property um thank
 
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
you for giving me the opportunity to
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
speak today um before I jump into courts
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to I did did some quick
 
03:41:06.080 --> 03:41:07.349 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to I did did some quick
math

03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
math
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
um Das or the plant and property
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
division of Das I should say because
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's some uh financial data
 
03:41:15.990 --> 03:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
management projects on here as well
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
we in our original request um our
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
projects totaled $73 million so you'll
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
see that um our maintenance is kind of a
 
03:41:30.189 --> 03:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
a a tail that we keep chasing um in
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to get things funded and
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get things done um in our
 
03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
state buildings so with that request
 
03:41:38.110 --> 03:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's um paired down to what you see here
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
on this list today so I will start with
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
the court facilities projects um there's
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
four projects that made the list here uh
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
the first one Hillsboro County South
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
which is the Hillsboro County courthouse
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
located in nashwa um we'd like to
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
complete a cooling and building controls
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
project that was started this year um so
 
03:42:00.030 --> 03:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
we did have some funding uh available to
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
start that project however
 
03:42:06.030 --> 03:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
um some of you might recall two years
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
ago when we requested that funding that
 
03:42:10.830 --> 03:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
um we were planning to either use it for
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County or Hillsboro County um
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
and so was actually a number that was
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
based on the Rockingham County project
 
03:42:19.710 --> 03:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
but we were able to use it in NASA and
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
we were just requesting the remainder of
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
the funds to complete that project uh
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
the cooling system uh the existing
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
system had failed and so it's good that
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
we were able to get in there and at
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
least get the project started to get
 
03:42:32.590 --> 03:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
them some Cooling in that
 
03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
location um the second project the
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Circuit Courthouse um has a
 
03:42:39.550 --> 03:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
failed underground storage tank we're
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're operating with a very small
 
03:42:44.149 --> 03:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
temporary oil tank right now that has
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
filled um almost weekly at this point
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
because there's no room on the site to
 
03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
put an above ground storage tank that's
 
03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
large enough to heat the courthouse um
 
03:42:55.389 --> 03:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time so we're
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
proposing to put a permanent tank in and
 
03:42:59.550 --> 03:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
again locate that
 
03:43:02.910 --> 03:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
underground um boilers in Portsmith and
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
Dover are both um over 20 years old um
 
03:43:09.389 --> 03:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
and and kind of limping along to get us
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
some heat this winter and so very urgent
 
03:43:14.110 --> 03:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
that we get those two locations um
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
replaced and then the final Court um
 
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
project actually is for six roofs and we
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
decided to combine them because some of
 
03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
them were very um small and we didn't
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
want to put in a request for a small um
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money maybe like $100,000 so
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
we figured combining those um would be a
 
03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
a good way to get them all done it also
 
03:43:35.349 --> 03:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
gives us some flexibility because as
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past few years um
 
03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
Roofing projects can come in really high
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
over budget or they can come in under
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
budget and putting them all all six
 
03:43:46.590 --> 03:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
together in one project gives us the
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility to kind of shift money back
 
03:43:50.349 --> 03:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
and forth between the projects if we
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
need to um so those are my comments on
 
03:43:54.269 --> 03:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
the court projects I'd be happy to
 
03:43:56.429 --> 03:43:56.439 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions any comments on courts I do
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
have one I note that what was sent to
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
the governor included we won't talk
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
about a new courthouse but the the
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
generator installations that's been a
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
perennial issue
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
with the courts as we go through the
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget over the last few
 
03:44:19.760 --> 03:44:21.990 align:start position:0%
capital budget over the last few
bium

03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
bium
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
um what is the status of of ongoing ones
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
and where would these go if we were to
 
03:44:31.710 --> 03:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
approve it by some
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
fluke great yeah so the original request
 
03:44:39.670 --> 03:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
um that was put in before my time um
 
03:44:41.870 --> 03:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
included 10 locations and what we did
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
last time was we split that into two
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
projects we said here are the five most
 
03:44:49.229 --> 03:44:49.239 align:start position:0%
critical um and those most critical ones
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
were mostly located in the North country
 
03:44:52.750 --> 03:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
where the temperatures tend to get
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
colder and we have five other ones that
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
are um uh closer to the conquered area
 
03:45:01.149 --> 03:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
we also have some portable generators
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
which is much easier to kind of move
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
those around in the conquered area than
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
to drive them all the way up to Coos
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
County and so when we split the project
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
two years ago we did get funding for
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
five locations um and that project is
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
finishing design currently and those
 
03:45:18.429 --> 03:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
installations will hopefully happen in
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
the coming um warmer season um so that
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're ready for next winter and um when
 
03:45:27.870 --> 03:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
I talked to my Bureau administrator
 
03:45:29.870 --> 03:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
earlier this week you know she did say
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
that these four projects that are that
 
03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
are um on this list now are our top
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
priority certainly that generator
 
03:45:38.189 --> 03:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
project would come in at number five if
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
we were to get an additional project um
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
for the court buildings um the fortunate
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing is we we haven't run into any
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
long-term power outages in this part of
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
the state um that have affected the cour
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
houses in the in the recent past and so
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
that's kind of been working in our favor
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
we do have the portable units which um
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
can get us by in one or two locations
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
but if we have a major Statewide um
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
blackout then we will have a have an
 
03:46:05.910 --> 03:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
issue there as
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
well then you may not have an answer but
 
03:46:12.910 --> 03:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
there was a separate bill we heard
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
earlier um this year about a capital
 
03:46:19.229 --> 03:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation for digitizing the Supreme
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
Court Records I'm not sure if that would
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
follow the court facilities judicial
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
branch or or where do you have if if we
 
03:46:31.070 --> 03:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
were to do anything where would you
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
suggest R Do It um that sounds to me to
 
03:46:37.389 --> 03:46:37.399 align:start position:0%
be more of a court operations um project
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
and so I would think that that would
 
03:46:40.189 --> 03:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
fall under the judicial
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
branch thank you any other questions on
 
03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:46.229 align:start position:0%
branch thank you any other questions on
court

03:46:46.229 --> 03:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
Z that thank you um the next group of
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
projects here is for a group called
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and asset management and
 
03:46:55.870 --> 03:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
that's the technical term for our
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
buildings over on the New Hampshire
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital campus um that used to be um
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hospital buildings but are now used as
 
03:47:06.189 --> 03:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
office space for mostly DHHS but also
 
03:47:09.070 --> 03:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
some other agencies as well um as
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
Charlie mentioned before um life safety
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
was prioritized here so project number
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
one includes four different life safety
 
03:47:18.990 --> 03:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
projects which include fire suppression
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
fire alarms um sprinklers where we don't
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
have any
 
03:47:26.670 --> 03:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
currently um item two also Life Safety
 
03:47:29.950 --> 03:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
we had a few um minor incidents which
 
03:47:32.910 --> 03:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
had led us to um start to investigate
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
the the old wiring in the main building
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
um neither one of those incidents were
 
03:47:38.670 --> 03:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
related to the wiring but we are a
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
little concerned that um we should do a
 
03:47:43.469 --> 03:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
full investigation on what types of
 
03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
wiring are in that existing building and
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
um start rewiring areas that have
 
03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
outdated wiring that could be um a
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
hazard um number three is for the fil
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
Brook building which we are no longer in
 
03:47:59.950 --> 03:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
control of but has been transferred to
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services for a client
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
facility um however the sewer line does
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced it has roots growing
 
03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
into the piping um so it's it's a matter
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
of time before it will fail I have been
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
in contact with HHS and they do want to
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
move forward with this project so um I
 
03:48:20.910 --> 03:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to tell you that it's not a
 
03:48:23.070 --> 03:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
priority for me um it is a priority for
 
03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
HHS and I do think that it needs to be
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
done um item four the their building
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
again is a roof as Charlie alluded to we
 
03:48:32.550 --> 03:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of roofing projects it's
 
03:48:34.349 --> 03:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
almost like every two years we're going
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
to have a whole list of roofs that are
 
03:48:38.950 --> 03:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
ready to be done so uh there is there's
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
up this year in terms of um ready to be
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
replaced and then number five is the old
 
03:48:47.309 --> 03:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
tunnel system that runs under the uh New
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital campus um some of
 
03:48:51.670 --> 03:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
those tunnels are used for pedestrian
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
travel between buildings they're also
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
used for utility infrastructure steam um
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
and electrical um there's some areas
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
that are not currently used and those
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are most concerning
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been down in those
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
areas very much um as part of the
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
conquered steam demolition project uh
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
two areas were determined to be um comp
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
compromised in that area and we've uh
 
03:49:19.469 --> 03:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
undergone the process of filling those
 
03:49:22.110 --> 03:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
in so that um if a car or even a fir
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
truck were to drive over that area that
 
03:49:25.870 --> 03:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be safe for them and it's
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
not going to collapse so we'd like to do
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
a thorough study of the remaining tunnel
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um and there's additional
 
03:49:36.030 --> 03:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
funds in there to repair or fill in the
 
03:49:37.990 --> 03:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
most critical areas that we find during
 
03:49:38.000 --> 03:49:41.830 align:start position:0%
most critical areas that we find during
that

03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.910 --> 03:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
study one question
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
have is in your uh the
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
CIP um for that last item it was
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.389 --> 03:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
620 which do you
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
need um the the $330,000 reduction is
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
not of concern to me um the study um is
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
probably in the
 
03:50:14.790 --> 03:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 range um we know of one area
 
03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
near there that needs to be repaired and
 
03:50:19.469 --> 03:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
we have a quote on that that's around um
 
03:50:23.550 --> 03:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
low 200 so 225 or so um and the
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
remaining funds whatever those might be
 
03:50:27.910 --> 03:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
would be to you know we triage the
 
03:50:30.070 --> 03:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
remaining areas and get done what we can
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
get done with the funds that we have
 
03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
available thank you
 
03:50:39.070 --> 03:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else if not just for the new
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee if you could
 
03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
just really briefly talk about what the
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
main Bill lead is and what the fair Bill
 
03:50:47.439 --> 03:50:48.349 align:start position:0%
main Bill lead is and what the fair Bill
lead

03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
lead
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
is used up we know what we're talking
 
03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
about but just saying main building main
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
building of what great yes of course um
 
03:51:01.550 --> 03:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
so the main building was the original
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital building so if
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
you're on the campus it's the very large
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
building with all kinds of wings that
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
kind of go off the back it's um several
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
hundred, square feet a lot of it has
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
been repurposed for Office Space
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
um some of it is in disrepair and never
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
be used again um it is a it is a
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
valuable asset because it provides a lot
 
03:51:24.990 --> 03:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
of square footage for us to put office
 
03:51:27.469 --> 03:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
staff in um and it's beautiful old
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
building it could use a little TLC but
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
it is it is a nice space um and then the
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
their building um Charlie probably knows
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
better than I but I don't I don't know
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
what the original purpose of that
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
building but it again a lot of those
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
buildings were used for either nurses
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
that lived on on campus or
 
03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
um you know different services that they
 
03:51:49.590 --> 03:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
provided for the patients that were um
 
03:51:51.630 --> 03:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
residents of the hospital so it's an
 
03:51:54.429 --> 03:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
older um Again original Hospital
 
03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
building that has now been converted
 
03:51:59.309 --> 03:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
into office space they is also if you
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
turn in the campus off Pleasant Street
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
which is how most of us would get there
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
and you immediately have to turn go to
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
your right or left if you didn't do that
 
03:52:10.750 --> 03:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
and decided to go cross country you
 
03:52:12.750 --> 03:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
would run smack into ther it's that
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
building it's the building that all also
 
03:52:18.149 --> 03:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
has daycare in it and I'm told um I
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
haven't wandered it um I've mostly been
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
in the basement because that's where the
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's where the new boilers are but the
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
fourth floor is supposedly gorgeous with
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
beautiful Woodwork and somebody said
 
03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's how you can tell where the
 
03:52:31.439 --> 03:52:32.670 align:start position:0%
that's how you can tell where the
doctors

03:52:32.670 --> 03:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
were because they had the nicest spots
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the and uh back in the day doctors
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
had really nice offices and nurses did
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
not so just saying yep
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
that any I see no hands raised on this
 
03:52:57.110 --> 03:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
portion Charlie do you want to talk
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
about the fdm project oh I'm sorry yes
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things I didn't
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
mention when I talked about how projects
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
get done is uh uh some of you will know
 
03:53:12.030 --> 03:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
that over time um IT projects are slowly
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
but surely eating up the capital buet
 
03:53:19.229 --> 03:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
budget um and uh uh I've promised people
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm not going to refer to the
 
03:53:22.750 --> 03:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget as the real capital
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
projects and the IT projects because
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's completely unfair um but there
 
03:53:30.910 --> 03:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
are there are some people who think that
 
03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
and I might sympathize with them um
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
Dennis goulay and his staff look at all
 
03:53:38.550 --> 03:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
the IT projects that are proposed and
 
03:53:40.830 --> 03:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
try to rank order them based on priority
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
everybody wants new computer software
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
right everybody does and everybody
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
thinks thinks if I only got a new
 
03:53:49.790 --> 03:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
computer program and I paid two four8 12
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
million for it suddenly everything would
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
be more efficient um and that's what I
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
thought when I upgraded my phone and it
 
03:54:01.309 --> 03:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
didn't work um the this project is for
 
03:54:03.149 --> 03:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first New Hampshire first
 
03:54:05.950 --> 03:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
is is what's known as an Erp ENT
 
03:54:08.910 --> 03:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
enterprise resource planning it is the
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
computer it is the computer system that
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
is on everyone's desk and it is where
 
03:54:17.710 --> 03:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
all of the stuff is kept all of the
 
03:54:19.630 --> 03:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
state's financial management all of the
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
states HR all of the states payroll all
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
of the state's stuff there are a lot of
 
03:54:27.309 --> 03:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
other systems but it is the primary
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
system by which the the the uh business
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
entity that we call the State of New
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operates we run it through a
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
division that's called financial data
 
03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
management it's a misleading name for
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
the division because it's not just
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
financial data but still it's there in
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the IT world everything is moving to the
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
cloud uh there are reasons for that that
 
03:54:51.309 --> 03:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
make it simple um it's very important
 
03:54:53.229 --> 03:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
that we stay upgraded in New Hampshire
 
03:54:55.309 --> 03:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't for 20 years we sort of
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
ignored every upgrade and and in the
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
early to mid 2000s we had a system that
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
was um held together with bailing wire
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
and paper clips and there was like three
 
03:55:07.309 --> 03:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
people who knew how it worked um and
 
03:55:08.590 --> 03:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
there was a danger that they might
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
retire um and that's not a situation to
 
03:55:13.469 --> 03:55:13.479 align:start position:0%
be in so we try to keep upgrade when you
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
go to the cloud the upgrades happen
 
03:55:16.870 --> 03:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
easier rather than
 
03:55:19.950 --> 03:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
catastrophic um giant disruption to
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
business um it had this fairly high on
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
their list because um we should have
 
03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
gone to the cloud years ago and the
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
money is not there it's it's uh it's $5
 
03:55:32.910 --> 03:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
million it would last a long time it
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
would require an enormous amount of work
 
03:55:37.870 --> 03:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
by everybody in the state's accounting
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
staff in every department and everybody
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
on the state's HR staff in every
 
03:55:44.910 --> 03:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
department but it's critical to the
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
functionality of the system and if we
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
don't do it we will eventually
 
03:55:52.269 --> 03:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
be a I don't want to say a second class
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
citizen because it's not like we're
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
running first class stuff it's it's this
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
is a good program but it's um you know
 
03:56:00.790 --> 03:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's not a Cadillac it's just a nice
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
Chevy um but we want to keep keep a nice
 
03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
Chevy and I don't want to start driving
 
03:56:08.830 --> 03:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
a Yugo um that's not a good explanation
 
03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
and and Alex would be very disappointed
 
03:56:13.469 --> 03:56:13.479 align:start position:0%
at my description but it's very uh it's
 
03:56:16.349 --> 03:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
very important to the to the financial
 
03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
and and HR System of the state that we
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
go that we go to the cloud and we can't
 
03:56:22.750 --> 03:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
do it without spending a modest amount
 
03:56:24.670 --> 03:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
of money although I know $5 million
 
03:56:26.189 --> 03:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot and Karen's gonna go
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
what do you mean modest it's $5 million
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
I could do like 106 roofs but that's
 
03:56:34.349 --> 03:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
stand questions commission
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
this I do have one
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I agree that if
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
something we need to
 
03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
do um is are we talking a multi bium
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
project with this um so could is this
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
just the first down payment is this the
 
03:57:02.910 --> 03:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
total amount and if it's the total
 
03:57:05.469 --> 03:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
amount could we split it between two
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
bium in order to do another leaky roof
 
03:57:10.159 --> 03:57:12.149 align:start position:0%
bium in order to do another leaky roof
somewhere

03:57:12.149 --> 03:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a good question I I
 
03:57:14.840 --> 03:57:15.910 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a good question I I
don't

03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
think the the the problem is that um a
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the costs are going to happen in
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
the banum will it leech over into a
 
03:57:27.030 --> 03:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
third year yes there some of the um some
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the implementation cost will leech
 
03:57:30.630 --> 03:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
over into a third year not a significant
 
03:57:33.670 --> 03:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
portion of them um
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we have to
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
commit we have to um once once we commit
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
we're committed if you know what I mean
 
03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
we have to either do the whole thing or
 
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
not do it at all and and the danger with
 
03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
not doing it in one budget is that
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
um you you quite we have to sign a
 
03:57:54.189 --> 03:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
contract we're gonna have to sign a
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
contract for this amount um because we
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're signing a contract saying you know
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're going to do the whole
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
project um and uh well and we literally
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
can't sign a contract if the money's not
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
there so um uh you know in for infor is
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
the name of the company they're not
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to say well do the first half and
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
then let's just talk about it in in in
 
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
12 months mon so it it isn't it even
 
03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
though it takes a while it's not the
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
kind of project that you can um what's
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
the word I'm looking for it's not
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
scalable if you know what I mean so I
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
kind of don't think we can I I will I
 
03:58:29.710 --> 03:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
will go back and see if there's some
 
03:58:32.349 --> 03:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
ability to do that but I'm I'm worried
 
03:58:34.550 --> 03:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we uh that we literally can't
 
03:58:38.149 --> 03:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:38.159 --> 03:58:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
thing

03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Thompson um
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
I see in
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh Section 8 the governor's bill here
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget um cloud services
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
there5 million under the department of
 
03:58:58.720 --> 03:59:00.469 align:start position:0%
there5 million under the department of
Information

03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
Information
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
Technology are these two not
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
overlapping they um they are they are
 
03:59:08.110 --> 03:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
not overlapping I I'm going to be honest
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know that particular
 
03:59:13.030 --> 03:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
project but I think it's
 
03:59:16.149 --> 03:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
um how do I put this um cloud services
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
Everything is Everything is Going to the
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
quote unquote Cloud um a lot of your the
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
data on your phone is on the cloud for
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
example if if you have if you take
 
03:59:25.950 --> 03:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
pictures with your phone I don't want to
 
03:59:27.870 --> 03:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
presume anything but if you take
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
pictures with your phone and a lot of
 
03:59:31.229 --> 03:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
people do most of those pictures are
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
stored on the cloud so it doesn't clog
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
up your phone um and around the state
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
there are uh I'm going to say dozens but
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
probably more than dozens of systems so
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
while the system I'm talking about is um
 
03:59:46.349 --> 03:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
I would describe as the the skeletal
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
backbone of the state's computer system
 
03:59:50.590 --> 03:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
because it's how we run
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
operations there's a many multi-million
 
03:59:57.550 --> 03:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
dollar system at HHS that runs um uh
 
03:59:59.149 --> 03:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid there are actually there
 
04:00:01.229 --> 04:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
probably six or seven multi-million
 
04:00:03.630 --> 04:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
dollar systems at HHS that run this or
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
that or the other thing they're
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
internally we have a uh we have a
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
separate computer system for Cost
 
04:00:10.830 --> 04:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
Containment which is small we have a
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
larger computer system to manage um
 
04:00:16.149 --> 04:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance projects micromain I think
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's called which is which Karen
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
overseas and other things like that what
 
04:00:23.870 --> 04:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
what D what it is trying to do is is to
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
move as much data as they can to the
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
cloud and provide services for those but
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
none of that's related to New Hampshire
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
first so there's so there isn't
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
overlap it's just that the name is the
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
name signifies a type of thing you're
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
doing where your
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
data is so when I say we're moving we're
 
04:00:48.070 --> 04:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
moving uh uh New Hampshire first to the
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
cloud it's not about that it's not just
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
about um disaster recovery and and the
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
fact that your data is stored in a place
 
04:00:58.429 --> 04:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
that can't get struck by lightning
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
because it's in six places and one of
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
them's under underground in a mountain
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
in New York um it's that we're making a
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
significant uh generational upgrade to
 
04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
the system and that's one thing um it's
 
04:01:16.349 --> 04:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
not just about where the data is stored
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
helps um I understand that and I
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
understand that we probably have a
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
number of different systems within the
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
state but it seems like if we're going
 
04:01:31.760 --> 04:01:33.630 align:start position:0%
state but it seems like if we're going
to

04:01:33.630 --> 04:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
spend 85 million dollar just on these
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
two divisions of the state there must be
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
others that are going to ask for similar
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
funds is there not a way to gather all
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
these together and and accumulate some
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
savings I compiling all I I think that
 
04:02:00.110 --> 04:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
if you'll recall to what uh commissioner
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
gay was talking about this morning is
 
04:02:06.030 --> 04:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
that he does work over all all that and
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
he did provide us with a sheet that
 
04:02:11.710 --> 04:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
showed how much was going into e agency
 
04:02:15.630 --> 04:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
for it things um I'll make sure you get
 
04:02:18.269 --> 04:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
it but if you have a question of that I
 
04:02:21.070 --> 04:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
think that the question should go to uh
 
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule on the inter
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
relationship of those two especially
 
04:02:28.750 --> 04:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
those two items and whether or not those
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
overlap or or whatever and I think that
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
if you could do that and share it with
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
the committee I would appreciate it
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
you any other questions on um the
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
financial data management I know you've
 
04:02:53.349 --> 04:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
been working on this for a while
 
04:02:58.510 --> 04:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner forever I think I think it
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
is uh General Services great thank you
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so General Services is another group
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
of buildings that fall under the
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
division of plant property um General
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
Services has the rest of the office
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
buildings in conquered um so Hazen Drive
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
is included there um downtown um and a
 
04:03:23.189 --> 04:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
few other buildings that are kind of
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
scattered around um the first project
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
HHS roof replacement so that is the 2729
 
04:03:33.389 --> 04:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
he and drive building um that houses
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
doit HHS and um Environmental Services
 
04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I have to go into too
 
04:03:41.550 --> 04:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
much detail on roofs we have a lot of
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
roofs um and anyone that have made this
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
list definitely have uh their fair share
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
of leaks um item two is a mechanical
 
04:03:52.269 --> 04:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
replacement project for that same
 
04:03:55.710 --> 04:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
building again this was um another uh
 
04:03:58.149 --> 04:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
project that um is beginning now that we
 
04:04:02.790 --> 04:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
have some Capital funding for um we have
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh enough funding to do three out of the
 
04:04:07.870 --> 04:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
five air handling units um and none of
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
the controls so this this additional
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
money would allow us to finish that
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
project um item three uh is the tank
 
04:04:19.229 --> 04:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
removal underground storage tank removal
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
so um Dees would like to see all
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks removed and
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
replaced with above above ground tanks
 
04:04:29.309 --> 04:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
because it's the safer thing to do um as
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in the courts project
 
04:04:32.149 --> 04:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's just not the
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
availability to put that on um any
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
location on the property and so we have
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
to use the underground but these uh the
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
ones at Morton John and Johnson um and
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
HHS are older tanks that um
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
potentially could be could could become
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
compromised um so we'd like to remove
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
those um item four is a variety of um
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
mechanical Replacements and repairs
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
again um sometimes with the smaller
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
mechanical projects just like we saw
 
04:05:02.149 --> 04:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the smaller roof projects we tend
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
to combine those into one larger project
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
um which allows us a little bit more
 
04:05:08.550 --> 04:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility in terms of whether one
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
building comes in over or under um
 
04:05:15.790 --> 04:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
budget um again uh Spalding
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
hbac um a lot of our buildings have uh
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
30 plus year old mechanical equipment
 
04:05:23.469 --> 04:05:23.479 align:start position:0%
that is just kind of limping along and
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
um needs to be replaced so Spalding is
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
another um old Hospital campus Building
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
that is currently occupied by the
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
um and then number six the Supreme Court
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
also has um I I believe a very old hvic
 
04:05:41.710 --> 04:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
equipment this has been a request that
 
04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
has been in um at least since 2007 I
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
believe and it finally made made the
 
04:05:49.149 --> 04:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
governor's cut so that makes me very
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
happy to see um but again a lot of our
 
04:05:52.990 --> 04:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
equipment is just very outdated and
 
04:05:54.670 --> 04:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
limping along and at risk of failing at
 
04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
any time so um those were the six
 
04:05:59.070 --> 04:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
projects that made the list here for
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
General services and I'd be happy to
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.189 --> 04:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
committee no hand H representative
 
04:06:12.199 --> 04:06:14.710 align:start position:0%
committee no hand H representative
Newman

04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
04:06:19.229 --> 04:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
please represent okay here I here I am
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
Karen a question for you you just you
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
just mentioned about the underground
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
tanks that you like to get them gone but
 
04:06:33.550 --> 04:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
in the I believe it was the first
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
presentation the Lebanon tank that is
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
still going to be an underground
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
tank yes the the the piece of land that
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
the building is on is such that there's
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
no place to put an above ground tank
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
that is large enough to run the building
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
we like to get a building at least two
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
weeks on a tank of oil because um if
 
04:06:58.830 --> 04:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
there's any disruption in the supply
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
chain in terms of getting um heating oil
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
to the site um we like to have at least
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
two weeks of of oil kind of on standby
 
04:07:07.469 --> 04:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
so that we can run the facility and so
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere um available on that
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
piece of property that we can put a tank
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
that size we're currently I think I
 
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned using an above ground tank
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's very small and it has to filled
 
04:07:20.309 --> 04:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
at least once a week so it's it's not
 
04:07:24.910 --> 04:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.429 --> 04:07:30.439 align:start position:0%
you any further questions on
 
04:07:34.349 --> 04:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
this seeing Statewide
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
emergency great so um we've requested
 
04:07:40.750 --> 04:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million for the Statewide emergency
 
04:07:42.670 --> 04:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
fund that's a fund that's managed by my
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
office as well
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
the funding there is available for any
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
State Building to utilize if they have
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
an emergency situation um I do have just
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
a few notes on things that we've done in
 
04:07:59.030 --> 04:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
the past year or so um with that funding
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
um we've used it to repair um the sewer
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
line in the archives building that broke
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
underneath the building
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so that as you can imagine was a
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
project where we had to get creative and
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
get in there and kind of dig it out and
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
replace it um a bird infestation at the
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
prison property um and also for um
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
components for fire alarm um that were
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
damaged at one of the rest areas um by a
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
lightning strike so it's things that
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
happen unexpectedly or untimely things
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
that happen that we can't wait uh for
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
the next round of capital budget money
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
to um to fix them and a lot of times an
 
04:08:44.429 --> 04:08:44.439 align:start position:0%
agency will come to me and say hey I
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
have um you know for example on the on
 
04:08:49.229 --> 04:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
the rest area project I have $10,000 but
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
I really don't have any more than that
 
04:08:53.309 --> 04:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
can you Pony up another 10 so we can get
 
04:08:56.710 --> 04:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
this project going and completed ASAP
 
04:09:00.070 --> 04:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
and so we tend to um you know try to
 
04:09:01.710 --> 04:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
split things with agencies so that we
 
04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
know that it really is an urgent
 
04:09:04.590 --> 04:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
situation and they're not just coming to
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.199 --> 04:09:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
funding

04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chairman yes
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for committing
 
04:09:20.189 --> 04:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
the question so is there I can see the
 
04:09:23.550 --> 04:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
definite need to have that Reserve um is
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
is there a balance in that Reserve
 
04:09:28.429 --> 04:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
today there's about
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
$700,000 dollars remaining in the um
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
there's several accounts that are still
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
open because um they kind of roll from
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
year to year so the in the most recent
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
one that we received there's about
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
$700,000 remaining in that fund
 
04:09:43.840 --> 04:09:47.070 align:start position:0%
$700,000 remaining in that fund
thank

04:09:47.070 --> 04:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions about the
 
04:09:58.469 --> 04:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
um what's the worst case scenario you've
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
had that in a given
 
04:10:15.109 --> 04:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
year um
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I mean I've been
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
managing it just for a few years so I I
 
04:10:22.269 --> 04:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
can't go way way back um certainly um
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know that broken sewer pipe that was
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
a few hundred, do that we had to spend
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
out of there I think it was between two
 
04:10:28.119 --> 04:10:28.910 align:start position:0%
out of there I think it was between two
and

04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
300,000 um we do have a million dollar
 
04:10:35.550 --> 04:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
deductible on our insurance policy um so
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
if we were had to have like a major um
 
04:10:40.830 --> 04:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
complete loss of a building um it would
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
be good to have at least a million
 
04:10:45.870 --> 04:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
dollars available to be able to rebuild
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
um especially if it was a a building
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
that we well all of our buildings
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
critical we're kind of bursting at the
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
seam so um to go without a building
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
would be really would be a really tough
 
04:10:57.389 --> 04:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
thing to do so I I think this is Charlie
 
04:11:00.309 --> 04:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
I think there was a a situation that you
 
04:11:01.790 --> 04:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
know Karen talks about things like you
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
know the bird infestation and if you've
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
ever had a bird infestation you know how
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
bad those can be um it's not the birds
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
themselves it's what they leave behind
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
um the uh so that those things tend to
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
be smaller you know we think at the
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
veterans home which was hund and
 
04:11:19.389 --> 04:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
something thousand and and there tend to
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
be a lot of those over the course of
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
although we've done really well during
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
the pandemic frankly um but every now
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
and again something really big happens
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
and and we had probably here before my
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
time but um something like eight to 10
 
04:11:37.469 --> 04:11:37.479 align:start position:0%
years ago graphic Services had a huge
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
problem uh the the warehouse down on on
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Sor Street or or Hills depending on how
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
you count um by The Market Basket
 
04:11:49.950 --> 04:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
downtown um and it was multiple millions
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
of dollars and because of the nature of
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the problem our
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
insurance didn't cover it at all so it
 
04:11:59.109 --> 04:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't like we had to we were only
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for the first million so
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
that happens on occasion but you know as
 
04:12:06.590 --> 04:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
Karen said it's typically not not uh the
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario is typically a a lot
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
of little ones and um and we use it I
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure people understand this
 
04:12:17.790 --> 04:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
that Karen administers it um but it's
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
not just for or or nor is there a
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
preference for buildings that are
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
managed by Das so Corrections is where a
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
lot of things happen and technically
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
they manage their own buildings but they
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
have an equal claim to the
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
phone thank you H thank you commissioner
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
I was just going to mention about that
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
warehouse because I was here with to
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
find the money to do that we did not
 
04:12:45.229 --> 04:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
have an emergency f that point um so it
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
made it a
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
little more of a challenge shall I say
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
because we did need to get it fix any
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
other questions on the emergency fund
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
representative AB yes thank you Mr
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um where would would conquered
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
steam would that fall into one of these
 
04:13:10.910 --> 04:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
categories or that was just completely
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
bu um are you referring to the the steam
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
boiler replacement project where we had
 
04:13:26.309 --> 04:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
to install yes okay um so in Charlie can
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
chime in if I missed something but there
 
04:13:30.109 --> 04:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
was about $2 million that lapsed in the
 
04:13:33.070 --> 04:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
original appropriation for that uh steam
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
conversion project which left us $2
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
million short to complete the final um
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
boiler installations um and piping that
 
04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
needed to be done to get all of the
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
buildings online with heat um so we we
 
04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
have used some emergency funds for that
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've also used a fund that we have
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
called the maintenance fund which comes
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
um all of the well not the courts but
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
the other two groups of buildings the
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
ban buildings and the general Services
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
building pay a a small incremental fee
 
04:14:04.429 --> 04:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
on their per square foot charge that
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
they pay to us to maintain and operate
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
the buildings um which goes into a
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund which is used to um do
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance proess some of that
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
money was also used to fill that Gap um
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
where the $2 million had lapsed so um
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
between those two sources we've um
 
04:14:24.510 --> 04:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
assuming everything comes in on budget
 
04:14:27.790 --> 04:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
we have filled that that $2 million gap
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
I I want to add add something to that
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
just for for people who know that the
 
04:14:34.389 --> 04:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
the replacement of conquered steam when
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
when when conquered steam decided to
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
shut down and I think we're even tearing
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
the building down now uh which is a bit
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
of a nightmare um was it $27 million
 
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
project that
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
involved I don't know something like 18
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
separate projects boiler here a boiler
 
04:14:52.990 --> 04:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
there you know something in the up and
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
Walker house something different for the
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
Annex in the State House some a third
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
thing for the L Etc and then all kinds
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
of stuff on the campus and South Street
 
04:15:03.710 --> 04:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere else um it's a $27 million
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
project a portion of that was a capital
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
appropriation um a smaller I want to say
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
something like seven million and the
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
chunk a big big chunk of it was in a
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill passed in the in the spring of
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
2017 um where they took uh you know
 
04:15:22.630 --> 04:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
unexpected windfall or strong tax
 
04:15:25.469 --> 04:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
revenues and they just paid it um they
 
04:15:27.870 --> 04:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
didn't pay it they set it aside um for
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
us to spend the money on the project
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
took forever and it it's actually really
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
fast given what we were doing but it
 
04:15:37.870 --> 04:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
seems like forever because we're still
 
04:15:39.189 --> 04:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know just finishing it and there's
 
04:15:41.309 --> 04:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
some you know we're Loose Ends thing but
 
04:15:42.750 --> 04:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that I'm sitting in the annex
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
right now and it's warm suggest that we
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
were successful um but and the whole
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
project is going to come in almost right
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
exactly at budget I mean we might be a
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
you know even a couple of hundred grand
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
short which is astonishing that you
 
04:16:00.990 --> 04:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
because you can't predict that I mean
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
that's ridiculous it's I mean it's it's
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
either Mike Conor is brilliant or it's
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
dumb loock or maybe a combination of
 
04:16:11.070 --> 04:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
both but um at the end of last session
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
we' gotten the project extended and
 
04:16:15.109 --> 04:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
there was language in in House Bill 2
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
and all of that and because we we had
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know $2 million left to spend
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
because this was taking a while this was
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
taking a while and then the bill that in
 
04:16:24.790 --> 04:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
which it got extended there was a
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution maybe you remember
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
that um we remembered intensely um and
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
then the bill that extended the funding
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
got vetoed and we get a call from the
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office saying because it was
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
one of those bills with 800 things in
 
04:16:41.790 --> 04:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
them and we were just sort of on the
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
edge and chump Chang
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
and not chump change but you know it was
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
all a fight over something else and they
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
said you're going to have to figure
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
something out you know don't stop doing
 
04:16:54.030 --> 04:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
the steam project figure something out
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and so this is where Karen I I said
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
before Karen's the smart one um she and
 
04:17:01.630 --> 04:17:01.640 align:start position:0%
her people figured it out and we you
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
know we uh you know R Peter to pay Paul
 
04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
and a little bit of money here a little
 
04:17:07.109 --> 04:17:07.119 align:start position:0%
bit of money there and managed to get it
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
done a little bit with emergency funds
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
but in the end very little and the
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund which was meant for
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
other things but we had to use for this
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
so um got it done some extra money was
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
needed but it wasn't really extra money
 
04:17:23.790 --> 04:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
it was money that went away that wasn't
 
04:17:25.750 --> 04:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to and we're going to come in
 
04:17:25.760 --> 04:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
supposed to and we're going to come in
under

04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:17:26.880 --> 04:17:32.710 align:start position:0%
under
budget

04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
yay any other questions on Where were we
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
oh Statewide emergency Statewide energy
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes so the last um group that falls
 
04:17:46.109 --> 04:17:46.119 align:start position:0%
under me is the state energy manager's
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
office um which I believe was
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
established in uh 2005 um I used to be
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
the state energy manager I did that for
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
nine years before doing this um so it's
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
near and dear to my heart um every by
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
anym we asked for just a little bit of
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
money to do some energy conservation
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
projects um the money that we get we we
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
turn around and give right back to the
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
state because we um invest in things
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
like energy efficient lighting uh
 
04:18:15.149 --> 04:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
boilers building controls weatherization
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
things that save the state money so
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
um if this million dollars were to get
 
04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
approved it would be invested in things
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
that would um you know have Energy
 
04:18:27.109 --> 04:18:27.119 align:start position:0%
savings and and pay itself back over
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
time um guess that's all I have to say
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
about that we do use it in all any state
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
any state-owned building is eligible
 
04:18:35.950 --> 04:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
just like with the emergency fund to
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
apply for energy funds in the past we've
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
used several different um techniques to
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
kind of distribute the money I think
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie and I talked about um you know
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
this with this million dollars let's
 
04:18:48.309 --> 04:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
let's do the the best bang for our buck
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
kind of projects regardless of what
 
04:18:51.149 --> 04:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
building or where it is so I think
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking to do this
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
year and get the uh the state the most
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
energy savings that we
 
04:18:58.510 --> 04:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
can today this morning at fiscal
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee um we were asked about an item
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
that's tangentially related to this
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
about a Federal grant for for energy
 
04:19:06.990 --> 04:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
projects and it's it's the same kind of
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
thing I mean it's the same thing
 
04:19:12.309 --> 04:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
different money um it's 40 grand um and
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
somebody said what do you get for that
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I said it's not that complicated
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
actually lower electric bills period we
 
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
do stuff we spend less electricity like
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
when you change out your light bulbs and
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
we save
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
money there was a press release that
 
04:19:32.349 --> 04:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
came out last week and it it has more
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
detail on this and over the course of
 
04:19:37.070 --> 04:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
the um existence of the state energy
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
manager Office we've avoided around $45
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
any questions on this I not
 
04:19:47.960 --> 04:19:49.149 align:start position:0%
any questions on this I not
representative

04:19:49.149 --> 04:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
a yes thank you Mr chairman um I noticed
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
in the Blue Book the request for this
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
fund was $
 
04:20:01.119 --> 04:20:03.469 align:start position:0%
fund was $
2,900,000

04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
2,900,000
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
and the governor has put it down there's
 
04:20:07.319 --> 04:20:10.429 align:start position:0%
and the governor has put it down there's
a

04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
million I uh
 
04:20:16.750 --> 04:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
it's funny I thought we requested um
 
04:20:19.710 --> 04:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds right so we there's a
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff that could be fixed the
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
state's buildings are you know kind of
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
rough and um you it's one of those
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
things if you buy a house that was built
 
04:20:29.080 --> 04:20:29.870 align:start position:0%
things if you buy a house that was built
in

04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
2010 probably not a lot you can do for
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency if you buy an old
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
Victorian probably a lot you can find um
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we got a lot of old victorians in
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
the state and so we got a lot of stuff
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
to fix so we asked for
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
we asked for money we asked for a good
 
04:20:46.429 --> 04:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
amount of money and I think the governor
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
looked at it uh I think the governor
 
04:20:50.429 --> 04:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
thinks a little bit like representative
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
Gram's earlier question about scaling
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
something back and he went yeah I want
 
04:20:58.030 --> 04:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
to do that but you know do what you can
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
with uh with this much instead of uh as
 
04:21:03.229 --> 04:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
much as you want and if you give us more
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
less uh thank you chairman uh actually I
 
04:21:16.109 --> 04:21:16.119 align:start position:0%
put my hand up right when um uh
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative Abbott started talking I
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
and I took it down because it was the
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
same basically the same question I was
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
going to ask and but I was gonna I could
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
ask further is there any feel for how
 
04:21:30.429 --> 04:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
much money we would get back um between
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
possible uh Federal uh reimbursements or
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
matching funds or because you had
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you felt we saved uh $45
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
million over a period of years uh is
 
04:21:43.389 --> 04:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
there any feel for the payback on on
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
investment sure so um the kind of the
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
rule of thumb that I used to use when I
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
was in that role was uh a 10year payback
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
is good for the state so there was a lot
 
04:21:57.550 --> 04:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
of projects that were under that so some
 
04:22:00.109 --> 04:22:00.119 align:start position:0%
were five some were two um meaning if
 
04:22:02.830 --> 04:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
you invest um $100,000 that you're going
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
to get $50,000 a year in Energy savings
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
so in two years you'll get your $100,000
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
back um somewhere a little bit higher
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
but if we are in a situation where we
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
need to replace a boiler because it's
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
failing or failed it makes sense at that
 
04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
point in time to purchase the more
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
expensive energy efficient unit because
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in our building for for
 
04:22:27.070 --> 04:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
a long time and so some of the projects
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
were a little higher some were under and
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
um on average we were running like six
 
04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
to seven years on the payback um
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
additionally we do have the opportunity
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
to apply for and reinvest um incentives
 
04:22:43.710 --> 04:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
and rebate so any project that we do we
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
also apply to the utilities um or the
 
04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission or both
 
04:22:50.590 --> 04:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
depending on what type of project it is
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
and if we are able to get an incentive
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
that gets redeposited into the energy
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
investment fund which can then be used
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
to reinvest in our state facilities to
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
projects if I could have a followup
 
04:23:11.149 --> 04:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you um when uh I've been
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
involved in these type of programs to
 
04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
review Energy Efficiency in school
 
04:23:18.070 --> 04:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
systems then we would prioritize
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
payback um on which projects we would do
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
first and and and it really helped uh
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
but after you go expend a certain amount
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
then you obviously getting into ones
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
that have less priority and is less
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
payback so if we right now it's been cut
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
from the 2.9 Million down to a million
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
is there any feel for the way the
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
priorities are set up of how much you
 
04:23:43.510 --> 04:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
would save if let's say you you got
 
04:23:45.870 --> 04:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
another million this
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
year um so one of the ways that we
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
decide what types of projects or what
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
projects we're going to do is every year
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
each agency that owns property is
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
required to do evaluate their facilities
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
and submit a list of energy saving
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
projects that they could do in their
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
facilities um we ask them also to
 
04:24:06.670 --> 04:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
estimate a cost and um an energy savings
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
from that project um again just like
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
with the um capital budget submittal
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
process those numbers can sometimes just
 
04:24:15.750 --> 04:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
be very back of the envelope um but we
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
take all of that information and we
 
04:24:23.309 --> 04:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
um we put it all together and we um
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
submit a report every year that says
 
04:24:26.590 --> 04:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
here's all the things that we could do
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
in state buildings if we had unlimited
 
04:24:28.439 --> 04:24:30.070 align:start position:0%
in state buildings if we had unlimited
funds

04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:24:34.109 --> 04:24:34.119 align:start position:0%
um and then over the course of you know
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
when we do get funding over the course
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the the bium we decide um which
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
projects are really feasible sometimes
 
04:24:41.950 --> 04:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
an agency might go forward and do a
 
04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
project on their own because it's like I
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
said if it's a boiler that's failed yeah
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
they might want to do it as an energy
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
project but they might just need to get
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
it done also and they might fund it some
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
other way go through that list and we do
 
04:24:57.149 --> 04:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
we we tend to pick um the projects with
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
the best payback um but also the
 
04:25:00.750 --> 04:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
projects that we don't think agencies
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to do on their own
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so if it's a very small investment um
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
with a very quick payback we might just
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
say hey take some operating funds spend
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
the $5,000 you're going to get it back
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
in a year or two anyway with the same
 
04:25:17.149 --> 04:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
savings um so I would say um with a
 
04:25:19.109 --> 04:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars I think we could Target
 
04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
probably that six to seven year payback
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
and as you said like then it kind of
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
gets incrementally um higher beyond that
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
but I I do think that everything that we
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
do would still average out to 10 years
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
or less thank you I I would say just to
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
so people kind of understand how this
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
work sometimes I um you can kind of see
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
behind me a window and then there's
 
04:25:43.229 --> 04:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
another one over here um um my office
 
04:25:47.109 --> 04:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
gets really really cold and uh and um
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
Karen is very unsympathetic to me um I'm
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
just saying out loud um but it and
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
because the windows are drafty is all
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
get out and you know I sit my chair is
 
04:25:58.149 --> 04:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
near the window I think I need to change
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
that but um and I said something once
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
about aren't windows don't we isn't that
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
a good thing to like fix and we got to
 
04:26:07.229 --> 04:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
be spending all kinds of money on heat
 
04:26:10.030 --> 04:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
because of the air blowing in on me and
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
um and in part cuz she's fairly brutal
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
this way in evaluating things she said
 
04:26:17.070 --> 04:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
yeah Windows aren't a good
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
payback so my windows have not been
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
replaced because apparently windows are
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
not a good payback so I say that to say
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
that we are routinely evaluating what's
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
a good payback and what isn't and even
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
if your your whiny boss complains to you
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
about Windows he doesn't get
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
them commissioner can we quote you at
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
HHS or others come in wanting to replace
 
04:26:45.550 --> 04:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
windows I uh uh yeah no
 
04:26:45.560 --> 04:26:47.070 align:start position:0%
windows I uh uh yeah no
maybe

04:26:47.070 --> 04:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
um any questions on the Statewide
 
04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
energy commissioner I do have one
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
request the the question came up about
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
the Statewide emergency
 
04:27:04.269 --> 04:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
fund if you could provide us or Karen
 
04:27:07.109 --> 04:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
more likely uh provide us with what's
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
been appropriated the last couple bi
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
enums of where the money went and what
 
04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
left before we decide whether to give
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
you you know half a million a million
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
whatever in this
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
one helpful just to see where where it
 
04:27:27.109 --> 04:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
is hopefully we'll never have that
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
warehouse situation yet KN on
 
04:27:33.149 --> 04:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
wood um we can provide that and uh would
 
04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
it be helpful if we send it to Mr Shay
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay this went than I
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
thought that's what I like to hear any
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
other questions to the
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner um or or admin Services um
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
process representative Thompson what is
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
the what's the benefit of a million
 
04:28:07.159 --> 04:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
the what's the benefit of a million
dollar

04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.109 --> 04:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars the insurance company
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the that we have to pay first what
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
what's the cost as opposed to having a
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
half it's a good question we we evaluate
 
04:28:32.429 --> 04:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
our our coverage
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
regularly and
 
04:28:39.389 --> 04:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
um uh so broadly speaking on
 
04:28:42.429 --> 04:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
insurance um
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
think of it this way for everybody to
 
04:28:46.109 --> 04:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
some extent insurance is meant to be for
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
for your house for anything is meant to
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
be sort of stoploss coverage you're
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
going to do the little stuff and you're
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to make sure they have the big
 
04:28:54.189 --> 04:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
stuff so that you know you pay for the
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
doctor's checkup they pay for the heart
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
attack you know that kind of stuff too
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
but um and on insurance you look at it
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
because if you have a $500,000
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
deductible you know our premium is going
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
to be higher if you have a million
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
dollar deductible our premium is going
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
to be a little lower then the question
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
you have to ask yourself is can we
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
afford as a as an entity
 
04:29:16.349 --> 04:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
the risk at my house we have a
 
04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
relatively low deductible certainly not
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
a million dollars um I don't think it's
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
that low but um um because you know we
 
04:29:28.349 --> 04:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
can't you know we don't have we don't
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
have money set aside we we self-insure
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
on health insurance because the state
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
can absorb the ups and downs and and ins
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
and outs particularly over time um a
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars was set a long time ago
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
as a decent number it went up when it
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
went up from 500 to a million I think um
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
they calculated the savings as
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
relatively extraordinary and realized we
 
04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
weren't getting much we've talked
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
internally recently this is not not
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
Karen's area but risk and benefits um
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
what we used to call risk management who
 
04:30:01.870 --> 04:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
who does the insurance buying and one of
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
the things we've looked at is you know a
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
couple of questions one should the state
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
just be entirely self-insured on
 
04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
buildings and not have any insurance
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
coverage whatsoever on the assumption
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
that we can afford it probably not we
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
can't afford that much like we couldn't
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
afford 10 million is a million the right
 
04:30:21.870 --> 04:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
number is two million the right number
 
04:30:23.070 --> 04:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we're going
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
to do is when our policies are up is
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to price various levels
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
what's a million what's two million
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
what's three million and then look at
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
our claims history and how many how many
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
claims do we have the truth is we
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
haven't really had many claims because
 
04:30:43.229 --> 04:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
we don't hit that number very often or
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
when we do the insurance company has a
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
way like they did at graphic services to
 
04:30:51.149 --> 04:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
not really cover it so um what's the
 
04:30:53.790 --> 04:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
benefit it's it's how much risk we can
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
absorb the emergency fund is the way we
 
04:31:00.269 --> 04:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh absorb the risk of having an a
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
million dollar policy um but it's
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
something that we have to evaluate and
 
04:31:08.109 --> 04:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
we'll probably be be doing over the next
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
nine months as to whether that number is
 
04:31:12.750 --> 04:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
too low
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you there was a um a
 
04:31:24.109 --> 04:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
comment uh Karen you made it early on
 
04:31:27.309 --> 04:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
about roofs and that quite often roofs
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
can be overestimated under budgeted
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
whatever and and you were trying to uh
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
um you know put a a a pile of money
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
together hopefully hopefully that they
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
would cover the roofs as needed do you
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
all look at different materials for
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
roofs or are all the buildings roofs a
 
04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
standard um I'm I'm I'm asking if you'd
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
use metal roofs at all if you've got any
 
04:31:58.030 --> 04:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
um comparisons that some roofs would
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
give you a better bang for your
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
buck a great question um we have all
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
different kinds of roofs in the state
 
04:32:07.389 --> 04:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
and not a lot of metal ones that I know
 
04:32:09.870 --> 04:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
of um especially at Das possibly on the
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
do side they might have some but
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
um you know we have membrane roofs the
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
kind that have the stone on top we have
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
like a typical like New England pitched
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
roofs that have shingles we have slate
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
roofs so we have a whole bunch of
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
different kinds of roofs um we do look
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
at different options so certainly when
 
04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're replacing a slate roof a lot of
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
times we just can't afford to put slate
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
on again so we do some sort of imitation
 
04:32:37.870 --> 04:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
slate that maybe really looks nice um
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
but the the interesting thing that we
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
noted was you know a few years ago when
 
04:32:43.710 --> 04:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
we bid out some roofs they all came in
 
04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
over budget and so I'm thinking oh
 
04:32:47.950 --> 04:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
Roofing has really gone you know through
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
the roof um in terms of pricing but then
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
the next round of roofs went out and
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
they came in right on budget and it it
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a funny thing that it
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
depends on the complexity of the roof
 
04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
the location um the condition and the
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
material so all those things kind of
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
factor in and um Public Works does a
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
great job at estimating but sometimes
 
04:33:11.470 --> 04:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
when they're estimating stuff um 18 or
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
20 months before the project actually
 
04:33:17.150 --> 04:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
happens a lot can change in the in the
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
economy and and and in resources and in
 
04:33:23.629 --> 04:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
and um you know Manpower too like
 
04:33:24.750 --> 04:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to just find a
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
contractor and prices go up so it's it's
 
04:33:28.390 --> 04:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
just one of those things that it's
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
really just hard to predict um
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
year-over-year what you're going to see
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
for pricing we had a lot of roof issues
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half ago and we did a
 
04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
we did a bunch of looking into it for um
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
you know Public Works was doing this
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
because we and you might know that
 
04:33:43.949 --> 04:33:43.959 align:start position:0%
there's a school of thought that says
 
04:33:47.551 --> 04:33:47.561 align:start position:0%
that we estimate everything too high and
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
come in under budget and there's another
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
school of thought I had a I had about
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
nine months ago I had two meetings in a
 
04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
row in the same week anyway where where
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
the one guy said you guys way
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
overestimate everything and then
 
04:33:59.830 --> 04:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else said you know what the
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
problem is everything you estimate is
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
underestimated and I thought well those
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
can't both be right and the truth is
 
04:34:07.789 --> 04:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
they are both right we estimate as best
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
we can but you can't predict markets and
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
things like that we looked at roofs
 
04:34:12.590 --> 04:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
because we were having problems like
 
04:34:16.349 --> 04:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
Karen talked about um and and one of our
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
guys I think Ted did this went out and
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
talked to a couple of contractors and
 
04:34:22.470 --> 04:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
said said you know let me buy a cup of
 
04:34:26.830 --> 04:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
coffee and um talk to me about this and
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
the one guy said I don't want to do the
 
04:34:30.070 --> 04:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
project State projects are hard to do
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
anyway because the state is UN
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
complicated so okay I get that that's
 
04:34:36.629 --> 04:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
probably not going to change that much
 
04:34:38.189 --> 04:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
um because of some of our you know the
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and and and uh
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
Protections in place
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
but he said we got a lot of business
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
right now and I don't want to do any but
 
04:34:48.750 --> 04:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to throw money at me
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
I'll do it so I hate Roofing projects
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
and nobody likes it and apparently
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
Roofing is not something a lot of people
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
like to do um in in the trades um and he
 
04:35:01.070 --> 04:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
said uh but so you're gonna put
 
04:35:03.470 --> 04:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
something out to bid and I'm thinking
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
could I do it for 150 Grand yeah I don't
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to I'm gonna throw a bid in at 350
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
which is ridiculous
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
but I don't want the business but if
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
you're G to give me 350 I'll take the
 
04:35:17.709 --> 04:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
business and so that that ends up
 
04:35:20.750 --> 04:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
happening the combination or combining
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
things part of the help that that uh is
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
is somebody goes do I want to go through
 
04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
all of this hassle for a project that is
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
100 grand and I'm G to net like 500
 
04:35:37.029 --> 04:35:37.039 align:start position:0%
bucks on no but if you're G to let me do
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars worth of roofing
 
04:35:40.349 --> 04:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
projects my Net's going to be greater
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to absorb some of the
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
hassle so sometimes we'll bid things out
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
multiple ways that way but it's a lot of
 
04:35:49.629 --> 04:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
times it's about the market you know
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
when the when the market was so good
 
04:35:54.349 --> 04:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
just think of you know a little more
 
04:35:56.029 --> 04:35:56.039 align:start position:0%
than a year ago there are a lot of
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
people who are like you know I got all
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
the business I need and so I'm biding
 
04:36:00.910 --> 04:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
high on everything if I get it I get it
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
if I don't I don't
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the people will tell you in
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
the middle of a recession sometimes you
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
get a better you get better prices so
 
04:36:12.590 --> 04:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it's hard to
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
know thank
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
you I see no other hands raised I I
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
would like to mention one thing um
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner kept holding up this uh the
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
the CIP I I would
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
suggest that as we're going through
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
agencies such as uh admin administrative
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
services that have multiple projects
 
04:36:40.590 --> 04:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
that you have that somewhere close
 
04:36:43.470 --> 04:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
because each of these lines they have a
 
04:36:46.590 --> 04:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
page or more of what exactly what the
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
project is so that we can look at it and
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
when it says multiple roots for the
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
court system it lays out the court the
 
04:36:58.670 --> 04:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
courts that they are looking at doing
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
they may not get them all if they can't
 
04:37:02.830 --> 04:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
get tce but at least it gives you a feel
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
for what they're saying and um
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
especially since we're trying to do
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
things via zoom and we don't always have
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the time that we would have if we
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
were in here every day in our own road
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
to question people it would be helpful
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
and I just make that
 
04:37:24.029 --> 04:37:24.039 align:start position:0%
suggestion anything else for the
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh representative edar uh
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman well speaking of
 
04:37:30.561 --> 04:37:31.551 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman well speaking of
uh

04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
Court I had a question on the uh
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
Rochester Circuit Courthouse the one
 
04:37:38.590 --> 04:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
that you'd put in for over 15
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
million um a lot of money and they see
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
it's been pulled but uh it also mentions
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
in there that you don't have the land
 
04:37:48.990 --> 04:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
yet or the price doesn't include the
 
04:37:50.830 --> 04:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
land do you actually have the the site
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
for it
 
04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
already no we don't we um this is
 
04:37:59.470 --> 04:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
something that the city of Rochester was
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
interested in um pursuing because
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're interested in our current
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
building um for City use um they have a
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
piece of land available that we could
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate um in terms of you know make
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
that part of the deal in terms of if we
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
sell our facility to them and and and we
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
think that the land that they have is
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate um we could certainly work
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
um we've built a lot of cour houses um
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
in the past few years um I I don't want
 
04:38:32.429 --> 04:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
to overstep but I don't think this is
 
04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
something that necessarily came from Das
 
04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
I think it came from the judicial branch
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and like I said initiated by the city
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
of Rochester so if it if it were to make
 
04:38:43.869 --> 04:38:43.879 align:start position:0%
it into the budget we would certainly
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
run with it and get it done um I guess I
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
guess that's what we have to say about
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
that I think I think there were concerns
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
and a number of people had concerns
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
about the land uh the question about the
 
04:38:57.390 --> 04:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
land and some of the other questions and
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know where do where do we want
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester to be at the end of the day
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
and and is it a is it a priority
 
04:39:08.230 --> 04:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
um I uh I'll just say this m so we had a
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
meeting and and and Ted really didn't
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
Ted from public works when we were
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating things said well they don't
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
have the land yet and I thought I
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
thought if the projects approv they'll
 
04:39:21.390 --> 04:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
get the land they're probably not going
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
to get the land if they're not going to
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
build a courthouse and you know what you
 
04:39:27.551 --> 04:39:27.561 align:start position:0%
can argue that both ways right uh well
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't come to us until you have the land
 
04:39:30.670 --> 04:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
and then Rochester is thinking well why
 
04:39:31.869 --> 04:39:31.879 align:start position:0%
am I going to buy land if I'm not going
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
to build a courthouse and and you can
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
argue it both ways but I think in the
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
end um while I am not as uh hyper about
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
whether they have the land in in front I
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
think that's probably a a reason that it
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
was not well shall we say didn't make
 
04:39:48.280 --> 04:39:49.310 align:start position:0%
was not well shall we say didn't make
the

04:39:49.310 --> 04:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
cut plus we built a lot of cour houses
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
the last couple
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
years if I could follow up please follow
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
um well yeah thank you for building one
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh close to here in Hampton we
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um but the question H have
 
04:40:06.030 --> 04:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh it lists here in the reasoning that
 
04:40:08.110 --> 04:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
there's a security problem there is
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
there a severe security problem at the
 
04:40:10.840 --> 04:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
there a severe security problem at the
present

04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
present
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh Courthouse
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
there I can speak to older buildings
 
04:40:19.390 --> 04:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
that were not originally built to be
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
cour houses um all have security
 
04:40:24.390 --> 04:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
problems based on our current standard
 
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
um recently there was a court and
 
04:40:29.550 --> 04:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
plastow that was closed as you may know
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
um things like not having separate
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
entrances for inmates that come in um
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
not having steel doors and the holding
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
cells where inmates are held prior to
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
traal um
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh things like that so I don't know
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
specifically what is happening at
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
Rochester I can find out for you um but
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
my guess is because it was an older
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
building not originally intended to be
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
used as a courthouse that there probably
 
04:40:56.430 --> 04:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
are certainly some security concerns
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
there are um court court facilities un
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
unlike executive and legislative branch
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
facilities where you know they're a
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
little bit Loosey Goosey on um Court
 
04:41:09.310 --> 04:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
facilities has an accreditation
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee there's a formal process
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a a committee is
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
chaired by the the Chief Justice of the
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um uh Karen and I go and
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
and um Sarah linbury who's the head of
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
Court facilities practically runs it but
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
she presents on on facilities court
 
04:41:28.510 --> 04:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
security on that uh there are
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislative members or there are public
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
members and they look at all the cour
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
houses to see if they meet certain
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
standards plastow was closed the first
 
04:41:38.590 --> 04:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
one in a long time because it was you
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
know they're holding as a closet I mean
 
04:41:44.110 --> 04:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
literally a closet and so at some point
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
people are like you know what we can't
 
04:41:48.030 --> 04:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
do this um Rochester is not at that
 
04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
point where there's an operational issue
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
but if you were looking at our
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
facilities um and you said you know you
 
04:41:56.670 --> 04:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
think of the the the more modern
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
buildings in in in Hampton and Milford
 
04:42:00.670 --> 04:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we built recently and the and the
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the one over in in conquer um there
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
are a lot of uh you know thoughts about
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know who crosses paths with who and
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
and holding cells and and all that kind
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
of stuff and they're very modern they're
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
all kinds of guidelines this wasn't
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
built according to those guidelines are
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
they making the best of it yeah is it is

additional information if you you have
 
04:44:43.550 --> 04:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
questions about a
 
04:44:46.990 --> 04:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
specific um project that that you're
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
interested in or concerned about because
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we're going to
 
04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
have to agree to a uh capital budget for
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
the house to vote on has been the
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
tradition of this um committee that we
 
04:45:06.350 --> 04:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
have come out unanimously with with what
 
04:45:09.150 --> 04:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
we propos and it sails through the house
 
04:45:12.550 --> 04:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
usually out a Voice vote um which for
 
04:45:17.430 --> 04:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know $130 million is a bad um
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
especially um some of the members but it
 
04:45:23.110 --> 04:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
helps if we can both sides can sell it
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
to their cognizes so we will continue to
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
work on it I know that Mr Shay and um
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
legisl uh legislative Services is
 
04:45:35.948 --> 04:45:35.958 align:start position:0%
working on drafting
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
hp25 and as soon as that comes out um
 
04:45:43.510 --> 04:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get everybody copy um but again
 
04:45:45.788 --> 04:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of time and putting
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
it into the right format for for a bill
 
04:45:53.070 --> 04:45:53.080 align:start position:0%

presentations by
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
agencies as you may have noticed looking
 
04:46:29.670 --> 04:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
at the house calendar it gets tight in
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
the lob for for scheduling all 20
 
04:46:37.548 --> 04:46:37.558 align:start position:0%

our is at the end of March um but we can
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
do the
 
04:46:46.200 --> 04:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
do the
presentations

04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
04:46:50.548 --> 04:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
remotely um you're GNA get the same
 
04:46:52.990 --> 04:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
thing from the agency whether you're
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
sitting in this room or you're sitting
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
at home as far as looking at a screen
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
and what they're bringing up or what you
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
have on your desk um
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
so I have been in discussions with the
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
speaker's office about doing the rest of
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
the presentations at after next Friday
 
04:47:15.628 --> 04:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
fully remote and then a couple of days
 
04:47:17.910 --> 04:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
in a hybrid with as many as want to be
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
in here in here to um do a work session
 
04:47:24.750 --> 04:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with an amendment to House
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 and then an executive session on
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
hus Bill 25 we can get almost all of our
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
work done in work sessions on um um what
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard and what we would like to
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
see in each of the agencies and once
 
04:47:42.510 --> 04:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
that Amendment is done the vote is
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
usually pretty um quick in an exec
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
session because we've already talked it
 
04:47:51.548 --> 04:47:51.558 align:start position:0%
out and conducted straw Poes on e agency
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
as we've gone through the the work
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
sessions for those of you who have been
 
04:47:58.270 --> 04:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
around that's the way it's worked and
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
it's worked well for the news people all
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
abouts evolved um because we are up
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
against deadlines and whereas in the
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
past um the chair had the option of just
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
saying okay we're going to meet Tuesday
 
04:48:18.750 --> 04:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um in room 201 for a couple of
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
three hours I don't have that option um
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
this year so um it will make a little
 
04:48:28.750 --> 04:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
longer days I fully expected that this
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon would have gone a little
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
longer there weren't a lot of questions
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
about um the projects from admin
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
services I don't know if that's because
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
the commission and Karen put put words
 
04:48:47.708 --> 04:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
in in the right order or what but I do
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
that representative Newman yes thank you
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%

04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
emergency and that came in to let
 
04:49:13.948 --> 04:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
legislative Services commun Services
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
upstairs and not to me it was forwarded
 
04:49:21.310 --> 04:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
to me um so that was last night I don't
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
have an update on on how Jim is doing
 
04:49:26.548 --> 04:49:26.558 align:start position:0%

04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
you and and so another thing Mr chairman
 
04:49:30.430 --> 04:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify we will also have to
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
have a formal public hearing on house
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
bille 25 where you will introduce it and
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
anybody have a beef or a complaint
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
probably that's there will be a formal
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 25 live um
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
my intent is to do at least one of the
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
work sessions here from U from all of us
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
on where we think we're going um and
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
then open a public hearing on what the
 
04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
go it will be at that point what the
 
04:49:56.240 --> 04:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
go it will be at that point what the
governor

04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
propose um although people hopefully
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
will have listened to what we're
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about and then after the public
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
Heary another shorter work session to
 
04:50:11.470 --> 04:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
develop the final Amendment um taking
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
into consideration what the public has
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
weighed in on as far as um their desires
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
for Capital Improvements within the
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
state because that is important um again
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that will be a hybrid meeting all the
 
04:50:27.708 --> 04:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
meetings for commities are going to be
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
either fully remote or or hybrid not
 
04:50:33.548 --> 04:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
just this one but all of of course we
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the lab State
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
extensions and
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative working on getting handle
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
a when to do that representative Mills I
 
04:50:46.430 --> 04:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
signed you up for that subcommittee
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh there'll be like four or five
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
people on that which is good and that's
 
04:50:55.868 --> 04:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
important because as you saw from what
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
the um Veterans Home put out you know we
 
04:51:01.948 --> 04:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
have completed these projects there's
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
money left over if there's significant
 
04:51:07.548 --> 04:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
money left over maybe we can fund a
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
different project or add to another
 
04:51:12.190 --> 04:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
project that got curtailed by the
 
04:51:16.390 --> 04:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
governor and and it's worked out um last
 
04:51:20.350 --> 04:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
a year ago and one of the last things
 
04:51:24.910 --> 04:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
that we voted on um
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the oous bills from the
 
04:51:31.548 --> 04:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
Senate um the several projects have been
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
completed since House Bill 25 been
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
passed and there was well over $2
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
million left to complete something that
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
we had shorted the the
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
PR technical education School in Hudson
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
so they were able to get that money for
 
04:51:46.878 --> 04:51:47.990 align:start position:0%
so they were able to get that money for
them

04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:51:50.110 --> 04:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
soon I would have liked to have had it
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
this side but we still would have had to
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
pay CTE in Hudson but that's what we try
 
04:51:59.788 --> 04:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
to do and I know representative Jack has
 
04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
worked on that before and we shall see
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.548 --> 04:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
not will be completely remoted not not
 
04:52:11.558 --> 04:52:12.430 align:start position:0%
not will be completely remoted not not
in

04:52:12.430 --> 04:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
up and again thank you very much for re
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
updating everybody well you know the
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
problem is that you don't update people
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA get the phone calls and emails
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just trying to help you no it
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
is and from time to time the speaker
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
will talk about sessions are going to be
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
and the rest and I will make sure that I
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
get that out to uh members of the
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee for planning purposes
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
of Representative m
 
04:52:45.390 --> 04:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair well I just had
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh one question that's been bugging me
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
since uh we we had the initial
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
presentation from the governor's office
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
and I didn't want to bring it up until
 
04:52:57.150 --> 04:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
we were all just in in Committee hearing
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
um was I to understand that the the gray
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
Governor's capital budget book we've got
 
04:53:05.948 --> 04:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
actually even though it's it's listed
 
04:53:05.958 --> 04:53:07.230 align:start position:0%
actually even though it's it's listed
for

04:53:07.230 --> 04:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
$127 million general fund budget
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
it has $2 and A5 million dollar in out
 
04:53:17.548 --> 04:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
of that figure that they don't need the
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hudson CTE Center if you'll
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
remember Matt May did go when he was
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
talking he said
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
125 he gave a figure of 125 not 127 so I
 
04:53:34.270 --> 04:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
think his mind he's already subtracted
 
04:53:38.190 --> 04:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
that uh 2 million
 
04:53:42.548 --> 04:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
so but yeah that 127 includes that 2.5
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
million for the CTE and Hudson so we're
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
we're less than that
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you well I think that at
 
04:53:53.190 --> 04:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
least gives
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
us the idea that we might have a little
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
bit of leeway if the governor was was
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
willing to come up with
 
04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
127 we might we might have some bump up
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
room on some things that's all I wanted
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
to ask about we can you know and I don't
 
04:54:10.110 --> 04:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
work for the government I don't know
 
04:54:10.120 --> 04:54:12.948 align:start position:0%
work for the government I don't know
about

04:54:12.948 --> 04:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.958 --> 04:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:54:17.230 --> 04:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
you but we have to be within reason of
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
what we think can pass as well so I that
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
is really important to be able to get it
 
04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
through both the house and the Senate
 
04:54:30.548 --> 04:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
with relative e um and not upset the
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
governor so much that he'll veto or
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
something um I think being reasonable
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
and working within the guidelines that
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
we put out plus what we have worked on
 
04:54:45.430 --> 04:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the past as a committee is always
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
useful for for guidance for us going
 
04:54:52.350 --> 04:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
forward then we do have um couple of
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
projects that people have come in for
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
outside of the capital budget that we're
 
04:54:58.910 --> 04:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to work on to see if we
 
04:55:01.150 --> 04:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
can f the the stream Fort
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
digitation being the one that comes to
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.470 --> 04:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
that what um What affected any is the
 
04:55:16.590 --> 04:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
president's new executive order on made
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
America have on these projects as we go
 
04:55:24.350 --> 04:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
forward your guess is as good as mine if
 
04:55:24.360 --> 04:55:25.990 align:start position:0%
forward your guess is as good as mine if
if

04:55:25.990 --> 04:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
we he can't his executive order the way
 
04:55:33.868 --> 04:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
I understand it is for federal agencies
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
Federal contracts and and I understood
 
04:55:39.390 --> 04:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
it mean any state projects that use
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
federal money as and that maybe I was
 
04:55:45.390 --> 04:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
just gonna say that so I don't know um
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
so we'll just have to
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
see and that's where um sometimes have
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
every project that is bid has a
 
04:55:58.830 --> 04:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
contingency fund on it um just in case
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of those things do go up for
 
04:56:04.910 --> 04:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
example if aluminum or Steel in the past
 
04:56:08.670 --> 04:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
we've watched um construction cost rise
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
this commune has watched them R 10 15% a
 
04:56:17.670 --> 04:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
year with concrete steel those types of
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
I personally just have one small water
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
project that is funded with Federal
 
04:56:25.510 --> 04:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
money and the
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
difference in a day on my material cost
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
where I would normally buy the pipe out
 
04:56:35.948 --> 04:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
$27,000 and in all honesty that's very
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
what we can do do at this point is go
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
with the best estimates that um Public
 
04:56:52.110 --> 04:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
Works has given us Das Public Works pass
 
04:56:54.910 --> 04:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
the budget with that there are always
 
04:56:57.990 --> 04:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
projects at the next by any that we
 
04:57:00.628 --> 04:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
cannot do we could not do this because
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
all of the bids came in
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
over and it's GNA happen you know do I
 
04:57:11.948 --> 04:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
like it no but it's best they do the
 
04:57:14.990 --> 04:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
best we do the best that we can as far
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
as we think this is the ballpark figure
 
04:57:21.390 --> 04:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know and if it comes in three times
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
the the amount that was estimated we've
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
got other problems do we have the option
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
setting aside money no we don't not
 
04:57:32.670 --> 04:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
really that's in the contract that's in
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
the actual contract
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
so and we also there's also money that
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
is set aside everything project for art
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
within the
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
building so we care too much with that
 
04:57:49.110 --> 04:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
and David bills is
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
frozen I
 
04:57:54.990 --> 04:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
thought oh he's back okay any other
 
04:57:58.548 --> 04:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
questions or comments I Mr chairman uh
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:04.830 --> 04:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr chairman uh there was a
 
04:58:06.910 --> 04:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
point in time a number of years ago when
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
there wasn't cost at least even a cost
 
04:58:12.430 --> 04:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
of living built into bids and where the
 
04:58:15.788 --> 04:58:15.798 align:start position:0%
10-year plan especially was so far out
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
by the time we got projects in mind
 
04:58:21.788 --> 04:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
everything was just toly low without
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
funds and that was as the chairman said
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
where we those years we had just even
 
04:58:30.548 --> 04:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
ASA in conrete jumping so much so I I
 
04:58:32.670 --> 04:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
commend the services on that bidding
 
04:58:35.390 --> 04:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
because they it's it's a much different
 
04:58:37.548 --> 04:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
process now than it was even 10 years
 
04:58:40.510 --> 04:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
ago right the only reason I raised point
 
04:58:44.548 --> 04:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
was um the Commissioners pointed out
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
that many of these estimates they come
 
04:58:50.430 --> 04:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
up with created 18
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
months by the time it goes through the
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
system we're talking two years out and
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
with that executive order and some of
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
them some of them will be
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
updated not so much when we have it but
 
04:59:07.470 --> 04:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
when the Senate has it
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the latter half of this year
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
um they will go you know based on
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
changes to Federal rules or whatever
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
we've got to change this and then you
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
got to drop
 
04:59:24.780 --> 04:59:24.790 align:start position:0%
something it's a almost zero
 
04:59:24.790 --> 04:59:27.150 align:start position:0%
something it's a almost zero
