00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative fellows for a
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
motion thank you madam chair I'd like to
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
move itl on this bill
 
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth seconds the
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
motion of itl is it would you like to
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill does is it exempts
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
proprietor trip ships which are single
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
person owned business and also single
 
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:55.820 align:start position:0%
person limited liability corporations
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
from both the business profits and the
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax
 
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
and what we heard from revenue
 
00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
Administration is they estimated that
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
the loss once we get a couple years out
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
would be about 36 million annually if we
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
were to do this
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
and they also indicated that they
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
thought that this could be exempting
 
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:24.620 align:start position:0%
just a certain
 
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.329 align:start position:0%
just a certain
class

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
of people being taxed
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
or you know of the of the business is to
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
exempt a certain type
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
um a certain type based on the ownership
 
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:39.980 align:start position:0%
would probably be inconse
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and you know they
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't say before because you know
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
they're dra but they recommended that it
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
should go we should get an opinion from
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice before we would
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
move forward with anything like this
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
oh representative jinnegan
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
um yes there's also um
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
just a fairness issue with this as well
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
um there's when you look at the
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
situation you can have a two-person LLC
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
that effectively May gross and net less
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
than a one member LLC and yet the one
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
member LLC doesn't pay taxes and the two
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
member or or larger does and and I'm
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
also aware of examples of people who
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
have proprietorships that are fairly
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
good sized and bigger than many two
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
person and three-person Etc LLCs and to
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
exempt them and and not you know you're
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to have a fairness issue as well
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
where was it involving
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I had raised this issue with the
 
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.389 align:start position:0%
um I had raised this issue with the
um

00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Wong but I'm
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
actually there's an email I haven't read
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
from him yet he may have answered it but
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh he calculated the BET loss but like
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
like representative janigan I have know
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
of some people that one person that had
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
who's a hedge fund owner
 
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
and has the rest of his business in New
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
York on who I don't know if he is an LLC
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
or not but if he is he's certainly
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I should probably mention for the
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
record I do pay bet and BBT so this
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
would impact me but
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
other comments anyway yes representative
 
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
other comments anyway yes representative
Spielberg

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
Spielberg
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think one of the
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
arguments in favor of this bill that was
 
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.670 align:start position:0%
arguments in favor of this bill that was
raised

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that an LLC is a pass-through entity
 
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
for federal income tax purposes
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
but in that case it passes through to
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
the individual who then files a federal
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
income tax return and Pays His tax
 
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.329 align:start position:0%
income tax return and Pays His tax
accordingly

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire where we
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
have no income tax
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
that analogy does not follow
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and passing the bill would result in no
 
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:15.740 align:start position:0%
tax whatsoever on this business income
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative putt
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to apologize for the
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh author of this bill Travis Corcoran
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
he didn't show up for hearing when we
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
were hearing it he didn't know about it
 
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
his his uh email was screwed up with the
 
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
clerk's office so he didn't get notice
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
on by five different bills so he does
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
apologize I told him what the likely
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
outcome was going to be he sits next to
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
more discussion
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%

yeah uh the question is because it has a
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note uh can it be on the consent
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%

what you think your committee's more
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
riveting than ours what committee would

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
information Jennifer would you explain
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that you can't
 
00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:35.810 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that you can't
pass

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
um that sort of Bill on consent but you
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes question representative
 
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.949 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes question representative
Sherwood

00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes she said uh if the on the consent
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
calendar was 20 to 0 ought to pass we
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
would need to have it on the regular
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
calendar we couldn't put on the consent
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
calendar because it's an itl motion
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
we will attempt to do that but it will
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
be up to the house Clerk to decide that
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
well Market is consent
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
um because it was an itl motion and
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
assume that but in all cases be prepared
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
to speak if someone has a question on
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
the floor if it gets pulled from consent
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
we never know what's going to happen
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
Okay okay with that we will now open the
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
executive session on 297 and the chair
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:15.409 align:start position:0%
on
yes

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
not very well at this point
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um but on this
 
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.909 align:start position:0%
um but on this
on

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
is a relatively a housekeeping measure
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
this year on the dedicated funds we are
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
repealing to on
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
on dedicated funds which have no money
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
in them and no prospects
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
of having money in them
 
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
of having money in them
um

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.810 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.100 align:start position:0%
on we also removed from
 
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.650 align:start position:0%
on we also removed from
consideration

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:53.660 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
five I think it is on funds which are on
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprise funds of the state in one
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
form or another and therefore report in
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
Fallen are audited in full outside of
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds committee so we
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
actually do not get the financial
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
information we need to review them
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
so that's um oh and the amendment I need
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
to to request that we pass the amendment
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
on which has been passed out now to
 
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.529 align:start position:0%
on which has been passed out now to
everybody

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
um that is
 
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.310 align:start position:0%
um that is
on

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
rework rewording both of the two repeals
 
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.070 align:start position:0%
rework rewording both of the two repeals
um

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
because we had on not remembered to
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
include the second on section of each
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.130 align:start position:0%
include the second on section of each
which

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.140 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
would stay have stayed in the the law as
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh establishing funds that will no
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
longer exist the room and board
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund uh was set up with
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
great Intentions by some members a
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
number of years ago to provide for the
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
Orphans of fire and police that were
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
killed in the line of duty but the
 
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:30.380 align:start position:0%
University was already doing that
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
and declined to move it to a separate
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
place and so nobody told people that
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
they could donate to that fund
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it has no money in it and it has
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
never been been used
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
um the Cold Case unit fund
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
was also set up with the ideas that
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
people would donate to a fund which
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
could help support the one person in the
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
Cold Case unit who is doing Muhammad
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
homicide work and the gentleman retired
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
a year and a half ago actually but in
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
the history of the fund which I think is
 
00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:20.299 align:start position:0%
about eight years they've had one 100
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
donation because nobody really knows
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
about it and I don't know how many cold
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
cases actually get solved that they they
 
00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
have a family that cares a lot about it
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
at the time it happens but there were is
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
only one hundred dollars which the uh in
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
the fund and we had quite a long
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
conversation about that and the
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
department of
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh safety is going on oh no of justice
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be figuring out where to put
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to put the hundred dollars as a cost of
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
the Cold Case unit and spend it and then
 
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
send a letter back to the family
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
thanking them again
 
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.010 align:start position:0%
thanking them again
uh

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
before we close the fund we've given
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
them until January I believe next year
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
and they said they can do that
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of minutia that we
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
deal with sometimes it's
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
a lot more complicated and than that but
 
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
this last year was pretty easy
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
all the discussion I think I see
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative Oliver's hand uh
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
representative Army take this question
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
yes it's my understanding that any
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund automatically goes in is
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed by these this fund unless
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
excluded or does it have to be
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
statutorily included on
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
when we started out
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
and we started out saying that they all
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
had to be included on I
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
I got the new Vice chair of the
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
committee to work with me on it the
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
first time and he suggested a hammer
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
which we put in which said if
 
00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:18.299 align:start position:0%
we have if we find you and and you
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
haven't uh registered in 612 within six
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
months then your money is getting taken
 
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.730 align:start position:0%
months then your money is getting taken
away

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
which of course we couldn't quite do in
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
some cases but you're going too far
 
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
some cases but you're going too far
[Laughter]

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's ever been done but it
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
did get people's attention uh but on
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are a number of dedicated funds
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
which like
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
Seabrook for instance which we took off
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
the books all together early on but the
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
new comptroller said okay you need to
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
leave these in
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
uh the the University of New Hampshire
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh fund even though the money goes into
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
it and goes out of it so quickly that we
 
00:23:09.419 --> 00:23:10.610 align:start position:0%
it and goes out of it so quickly that we
don't

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
that it's not registered anywhere
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and the liquor fund
 
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.549 align:start position:0%
um and the liquor fund
and

00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:22.970 align:start position:0%
and
and uh

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
no they they these are all separately
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
audited apparently in the kafir process
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
I believe it is on they are separately
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
audited and they are separately reported
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wish to
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
make that clear for the committee
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
because we're dealing with some
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds for a group along on the
 
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.409 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds for a group along on the
year

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
and I did want to make it clear to the
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
committee when we get a dedicated fund
 
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
committee when we get a dedicated fund
that

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that somebody wants to establish which
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to be funded with
 
00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:00.590 align:start position:0%
they're going to be funded with
donations

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
donations
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
we need to cut
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
ask them about their game plan for
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
getting the donation so we don't have to
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative yes
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is a question
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
for representative Almy I'm I'm looking
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
at the the amendment and I'm looking at
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
the and maybe I'm not understanding what
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
the amendment does because I
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
the the copy of the bill that I had
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
originally I I don't see the difference
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and what we have
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
originally in the bill
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
it looks like we've have those repealing
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
that those those things are repealed in
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe and I could be wrong
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
um they are repealed uh what chain well
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
two things that changed one is that on
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
Roman one but we did not
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
remove Roman 2.
 
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing all of this without
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
the original wording is on the second
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
page line seven second page line 17 to
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
20. uh and it repeals uh the first one
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
repeals uh 612 1B 278.
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.850 align:start position:0%
it does not
repeal

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:48.860 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
187 a20a 2B which is established in the
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
room and board scholarship fund
 
00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419 align:start position:0%
that would have still remained in the
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
law and somebody someday might have
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
picked it up and said what is this and
 
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.830 align:start position:0%
picked it up and said what is this and
why

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
on and the same thing
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
oh and that one also on somebody had a
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
hiccup and in on line 17 it says
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
relative to relative to monies and I
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
forget who picked that one up but we got
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
rid of that part of it
 
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.169 align:start position:0%
rid of that part of it
um

00:26:26.169 --> 00:26:26.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
and on five
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
on it also repeals the 612
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
and does not repeal the cold cased
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
so line 10 in the amendment is new and
 
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
Line 6 in the amendment is new
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
and line four is corrected for the
 
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.310 align:start position:0%
and line four is corrected for the
hiccup

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
so whenever there's an amendment like
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
that sometimes have to restructure it a
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
to make it appear proper
 
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.990 align:start position:0%
to make it appear proper
yeah

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.909 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
we we do sometimes find that the same
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
language is crept into some other
 
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.010 align:start position:0%
language is crept into some other
uh

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
part of the law too and it's better to
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
just do a word search and try to find it
 
00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:26.330 align:start position:0%
just do a word search and try to find it
but

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none the clerk will first
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%

00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
going to turn that into the committee
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it will have a different
 
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.330 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it will have a different
number

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
at that point we have to be a little
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
careful about did they get the numbers
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
wrong in the calendar because that's
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay we will now close the hearing on
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill 297 excuse me the executive
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
session and we will now open the
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 569.
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Ames for a
 
00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:39.649 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Ames for a
motion

00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
I move I move retention on the house
 
00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:44.029 align:start position:0%
I move I move retention on the house
bill

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
bill
569

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative elberger seconds would
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yes and
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill that uh might be
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
thought of in three different parts one
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
change the way the taxes
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
collected and deposited
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
and the second is uh relates to the low
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
and moderate homeowners property tax
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
relief program and the third is a study
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
related to uh property tax that's
 
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
embedded in rent payments and so on the
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
first part of the
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
uh which is often
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
if it's a component of the law that's
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
often referred to as swept retention
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
this bill would instead of allowing for
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
retention of excess swept I should have
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
said excess swept retention uh it would
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
require that all swept proceeds net of a
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh collection allowance for the
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be remitted to the
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
state and from the state would flow out
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
according to whatever formulas were then
 
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:16.220 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
to presumably School purposes but it
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
could be broader than that depending on
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
how over the years it gets characterized
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
so it'd be all money flowing into the
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
state net of three percent that's one
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
component of it and the second component
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
is the tax relief program and this bill
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
would change some of the numbers in that
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
in that and also provide relief from the
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
school tax as well as the swept tax
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
and then the third element speaks for
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
itself it would be simply a study of uh
 
00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
of the issue of uh property tax viewed
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
more broadly to include
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
um its payment through through rent
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
payments in effect
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
so why retain it uh the uh the reason
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
really is that
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
um we we talked about it when I
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
presented the bill that there is
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
litigation going on it's very
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
interesting litigation and it's uh it's
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
reaching its uh
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
hope it appears to be you always have to
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
put in a qualifier there reaching the
 
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.470 align:start position:0%
put in a qualifier there reaching the
end

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
um there is a motion for a partial
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
summary judgment that was filed uh
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
towards the end of last year it's uh
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
being hotly litigated and um
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs have filed their brief
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
the state has filed its repo its
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
response its opposition uh an
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
intervening entity called the uh
 
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.829 align:start position:0%
intervening entity called the uh
oh

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the name it's a group
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
of of municipalities
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and sympathetic municipalities that
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
um that pay act that retain the excess
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
swept so they used to be called donor
 
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.329 align:start position:0%
swept so they used to be called donor
communities

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
um concerned Coalition of concerned
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
communities or something like that is a
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
different name is that it I can't
 
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
different name is that it I can't
remember

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
Coalition is for short yeah
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh maybe something like that so uh the
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
Coalition has filed a brief too those
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
are in the Court's hands and now the
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
state of the United State the plaintiffs
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
get a chance to file a reply brief to
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
all that that's due at the towards the
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
end of this month the last week of this
 
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.510 align:start position:0%
end of this month the last week of this
month

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:50.420 align:start position:0%
uh so very soon and then
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
the uh State and the uh these uh this
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
Coalition get to reply reply to the
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
reply and that's a week later so all the
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
briefing will be done by uh early early
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
March and then it's in the hands of the
 
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.010 align:start position:0%
March and then it's in the hands of the
Court

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
um it's a pretty focused issue I
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised to see the court
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
proceed on it and issue a decision
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
fairly promptly as judge grew off but he
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be the kind of Judge
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
that sits on things
 
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.650 align:start position:0%
that sits on things
um

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:28.099 align:start position:0%
so uh that's a big deal and the
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
arguments in there are interesting I
 
00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
arguments in there are interesting I
just

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
will say that from the state from the
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
plaintiff side it's a tax issue and
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
um the allowance uh to
 
00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:46.339 align:start position:0%
so-called excess or high property
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
value towns to retain uh revenues that
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
are collected at this wept the Statewide
 
00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:57.740 align:start position:0%
education property tax rate above
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
that communities adequacy amount is an
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
allowance that effectively Returns the
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
money into the pockets of the taxpayers
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
of that Community resulting in a
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
disproportionate tax
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
that can be said more artfully but
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
basically it's a a argument based on the
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
tax clause in the Constitution which is
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
strictly interpreted there's not much
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
deference given to communities if you
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
you're either in or you're out
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the argument that the state is
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
putting back to that is say no it's not
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
a tax issue the money is collected
 
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a uniform rate across
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's received and what the state does
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
with it then
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
becomes a spending issue
 
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
so we switch over from
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
from the tax Clause of the Constitution
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
to spending clause
 
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to spending the state has
 
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh traditionally been given a lot of
 
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
leeway by the court to spend
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
you know to make up make its policy and
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
make decisions according to that policy
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
and the the court is unlikely to step
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
into that so that's that's the argument
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's been Advanced by uh the
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
respondents the state and the concerned
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
communities and
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
and its novel is new to uh to this case
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
anyway it was not raised in the several
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
cases in which this issue was raised
 
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll see uh and I I just
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you it's
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
interesting The Briefing is interesting
 
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:46.820 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
there's no point in going forward with
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
this bill at this time given that this
 
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:56.420 align:start position:0%
part of the bill may be
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
significantly affected by at least the
 
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
Superior Court decision remembering that
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
all was Superior Court decisions can be
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
appealed further but that's where we
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
stand that's why I'd like to retain it
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that I I feel the need to look
 
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:14.300 align:start position:0%
closely at some of the numbers in the
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
calculation of the refunds for taxpayers
 
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:19.460 align:start position:0%
so that other section needs some work
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
we'll use the time to do that work so
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.930 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you on during the hearing on Mr
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
Wong said that we would uh that he
 
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:37.460 align:start position:0%
really didn't know much about
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
the municipal part of the dra and
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't comment on how this bill works
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think it would be useful if this
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
becomes a hot issue to bring in the
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
municipal part of the dra and get them
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
to explain how that interacts with the
 
00:39:58.089 --> 00:39:58.099 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.220 align:start position:0%
well uh this bill
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
is a bill to I don't seem to find a copy
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.270 align:start position:0%

all right here we go
 
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.290 align:start position:0%
all right here we go
um

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
House Bill 220
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
is a bill that I filed
 
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.170 align:start position:0%
is a bill that I filed
um

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh largely because representative brahmi
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
who had led the effort that this bill
 
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:24.260 align:start position:0%
um relates to
 
00:45:28.089 --> 00:45:28.099 align:start position:0%
uh as we all know was not re-elected and
 
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
I felt that important to get this going
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
I have been working with him and he
 
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
would have done this uh
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
but he's not here to do it um so the
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee establishes
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh or you one might say continues a
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
committee to study the regulatory
 
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:53.420 align:start position:0%
structure of charitable gaming
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
and you have and what I've handed out
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
the main part of the report of this
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee from
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
dated November 1 2022
 
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.510 align:start position:0%
dated November 1 2022
um

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh Senator
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro chaired this effort I was a
 
00:46:19.569 --> 00:46:19.579 align:start position:0%
totally bipartisan commission
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
also on the committee was Senator gaida
 
00:46:28.569 --> 00:46:28.579 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette was there as
 
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.930 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette was there as
well

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so we we uh we worked as much as we
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
were able given covet and other
 
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.910 align:start position:0%
were able given covet and other
distractions

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
distractions
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
um but in truth as
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
as we neared the summertime Senator
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
Guida had decided not to continue in
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
office and uh with Drew from the
 
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee in effect
 
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh then uh I think there was one other
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
issue but I'm not remembering it but in
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
any event we we visited a number of the
 
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
sites where charitable Gaming's
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
occurring and uh and met and talked
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
about the issues and uh determined at
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
the end that we really needed to have
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
this effort continue and
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
at the end I just want to read this
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
the committee recommends filing
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to continue the efforts of
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
the study
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
the landscape of gaming in the state is
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
highly complex ever-changing and growing
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
at a significant rate by continuing this
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
study members will be able to move
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
forward in delving into the multifaceted
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
challenges faced by the game operators
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Lottery Commission and
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
the Charities involved the charge of the
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
committee would remain the same allowing
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
the members to build off of the work
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
already completed over the course of the
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
past two years I passed out a news
 
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.730 align:start position:0%
past two years I passed out a news
article

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
article
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
um it was actually from a New Hampshire
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
public radio that I thought was pretty
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
good and it just is uh out off the press
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
so to speak February 14th
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
and in here it uh
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
down in the fourth paragraph
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
talks about the brook that was one of
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
the casinos that we visited it is an
 
00:48:27.849 --> 00:48:27.859 align:start position:0%
impressive place
 
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
well-round well-managed and
 
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:32.930 align:start position:0%
well-round well-managed and
um

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
you know full of interesting things
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
and there's this statement and I think
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to study this uh the
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
the book is a stark symbol of New
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Embrace over the past decade
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
of a wide range of gambling options a
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
suite of offerings that would have been
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
all but unimaginable just a few years
 
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.770 align:start position:0%
all but unimaginable just a few years
ago

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:56.780 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
though a bill to legalize casinos never
 
00:49:03.609 --> 00:49:03.619 align:start position:0%
passed in the state house I should say
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
parenthetically that I was deeply
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
involved in that with that bill I was
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
the chair of the gambling commission
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
that was set up I think was during
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassan's time and uh this bill
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
followed from the work of that
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
commission and it got awfully closed I
 
00:49:25.569 --> 00:49:25.579 align:start position:0%
think it was a one vote margin
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
but it did not pass maybe that's just as
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
well who knows but though a bill to
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
legalize casinos never passed in the
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
State House so-called charitable Gaming
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
facilities have proliferated and evolved
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
into exact replicas of casinos complete
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
with craps games complicated carpet
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
pattern patterns and rows of slot
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
machines the state has legalized other
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
forms of gambling in recent years both
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
online and in person
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
should say that that reference to slot
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
machines is this reporter's way of
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
describing those machines their stock
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
gaming machines there has been a lot of
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
debate in this committee as to whether
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
they're slot machines or some other kind
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
of machine
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to get into that debate
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
but this is this is the new new world
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's out there I think it's a good
 
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.010 align:start position:0%
that's out there I think it's a good
idea

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.569 align:start position:0%
idea
uh

00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:31.329 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:31.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
so uh this is the New World
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
um and I think it uh it prudent for this
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
committee which uh has the
 
00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.550 align:start position:0%
committee which uh has the
responsibility

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
taken from the house to Monitor and act
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
on all gaming bills uh to
 
00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:52.790 align:start position:0%
on all gaming bills uh to
um

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand fully what's going on
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
um and a premier concern
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
um it's not I don't want to overstate
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
this uh Premier
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
aspect of the over overview needs to be
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
how because Charities are selected and
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh who gets the best gaming days and so
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
forth and so on who gets on the list who
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't get on the list and it's
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
important that that be fair maybe it's
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
totally fair I don't want to say it's
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
not but uh I don't I think there there
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
is uh that it's important that everybody
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
be on the same page on that so that's
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for having this
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee it is a lot of work I just
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
want to say that getting to
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ami's point about
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds we don't want to set up
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
something that's uh you know that I'm
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
going to flounder so I think we do need
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
to think about whether a committee like
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
this can can do the job that's being
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
assigned to it
 
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm not here so much as an
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
advocate for this is to put it before
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
you and tell you about it and uh about
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
the world out there that we all need to
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
understand and make sure it's
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
functioning well
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
so that's I guess that's the long and
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
short of my uh statement here and I'll
 
00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
questions and by the way for the record
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
I am a in this charity gaming business I
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
have a little operation right down the
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
street in Concord come and visit
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
sometime yes representative Spielberg
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
well if you wanted to see what we do
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
um representative Ames I'm just
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could give us your own
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the potential composition
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
membership of this uh your bill is
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
straightforward I believe four members
 
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
of the house two members of the Senate
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
so it becomes a legislative task jointly
 
00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:02.780 align:start position:0%
with the Senate the committee's report
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
recommends that a commission be formed
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
that includes legislators the New
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lottery Commission Facility
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
Owners and representatives from the
 
00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
Charities two different strategies and
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you could
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
give us some flavor on what you think
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
would work better in the public interest
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
well thank you for asking about that the
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
the recommendations you're looking at
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
the recommendations page of the report I
 
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.430 align:start position:0%
the recommendations page of the report I
think

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
there are two paragraphs there the first
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph is what I read out and that's
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
basically the study committee that the
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that I'm talking
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
about that's strictly legislative the
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
second is calling for a commission
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
um to focus in
 
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
directly at the Charities issue
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
um Senator D'Alessandro filed a bill in
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
the Senate at senate senate Bill 90
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
um to do just that and it called for a
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to support that
 
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.829 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to support that
commission

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
um I looked at the docket this morning
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
for that and it's it looks to me like
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's been ideal'd by this by the Senate
 
00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
so that's that's gone somewhere that
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
should be checked on but I think that's
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
the status of it so this is it and this
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
is uh just a legislative committee
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
um I I think if we recommended any more
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
Senators uh uh we'd get to Nowhere
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and uh maybe this should be more
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
legislators but six is a six is a pretty
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
good number and we're getting used to
 
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
other comments other questions
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
 
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.190 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
chair

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
um having been on Edna for four years I
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
know one time at least one time we had a
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
bill related to the charitable
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
um gambling and my recollection is that
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
there are a limited number of licenses
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
that can be had for these facilities and
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
we haven't maxed out on those licenses
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:17.109 align:start position:0%
we haven't maxed out on those licenses
yet

00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering if part of the
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
charge for this committee would be to
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
just look at that the fact you know the
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
licensing part and and how that fits
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
I would respond to that and say that uh
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
that would be within the charge it's to
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
study the oversight and enforcement of
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming licensure as part of
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
the oversight enforcement
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
sorry all me lost my mind thank you our
 
00:56:01.089 --> 00:56:01.099 align:start position:0%
names are very similar and
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
no no what's happening to the bills in
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
the Senate that do deal with the uh
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
eight license limit until 24 there is
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
one that that on I think uh
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
removes that says that that limit is
 
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.370 align:start position:0%
removes that says that that limit is
permanent

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
on and I think that there's another that
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
tries to expand it
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
on to a larger number but still finite
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
and apparently this these are being
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
taken debated seriously within the
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
Senate that and and other issues to do
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
with with the explosion into real
 
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.069 align:start position:0%
with with the explosion into real
casinos

00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
casinos
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know about the Senate bills I do
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
know that we're about to hear a bill
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
that um House Bill 607 is that right
 
00:57:02.579 --> 00:57:03.829 align:start position:0%

that's that's uh
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
that deals with the structure and uh
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
various sub elements of
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:27.420 align:start position:0%

good morning Madam chair members of ways

00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 607
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
my synopsis of this is it's pretty much
 
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping bill with three very
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
specific exceptions uh we just heard
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
the growth of charitable gaming in the
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
state and the fact that that model which
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony over the years is
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
a great model works well for the
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
charities in the state
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
many of which
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
count on the revenues who do their
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
operations and
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
many Realms in all our communities
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
this that I just lost forgive me
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation kind of
 
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
starts the process of bringing us us up
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
to speed and we will be examining uh
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 220 that you just heard
 
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
testimony on
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
about getting a committee together to
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
study charitable gaming but I think we
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
all can agree that
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
the model we have is
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
is in place and it's what we have to
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
deal with and I totally lost my
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
presentation yet please bear with me
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
take your time I just I don't see any
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
more pink cards from any other senators
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
or Representatives so if you are here
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
please send me a pin card so I can
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
recognize you
 
00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:44.289 align:start position:0%
recognize you
ah

00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:44.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Boom is having Tech problems here to
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
well I can speak to
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest of the changes that
 
01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
that's in this legislation that's
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
relative to what representative almi
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
brought up and maybe represented fellows
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
in the questioning in the prior bill
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term the moratorium
 
01:00:28.319 --> 01:00:30.109 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term the moratorium
on

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
the game specific HHR the machines that
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
are some kind times dubbed as slot
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
machines and and we've heard testimony
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
we know that this is not the case what
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
we did in the legislation was passed
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
last biennium was to put a moratorium to
 
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
a date specific which is a July of
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 24.
 
01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:57.500 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of the operators that
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
applied to and were eligible to
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
provide that game and their charitable
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
Gaming facilities
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
to uh to roll out this game
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
see the effects positive and negative
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
for the charities
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
and the operators in state revenue in
 
01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.809 align:start position:0%
and the operators in state revenue in
general

01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:22.819 align:start position:0%
in this rollout
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
I've heard from
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh different folks The Operators
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
Charities because uh if I can remind you
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
part of the component of passing HHR was
 
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
the ability to double basically take on
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
a second charity for the day
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
instead of the charitable gaming
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
facility servicing one charity on a
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
specific date they can now service two
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
if they have the component of HHR
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
there was some genuine concern
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
with some on this committee about that
 
01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:01.339 align:start position:0%
particular game
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
and the possibility of proliferation
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
of these Gaming facilities throughout
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and I share that concern quite
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm from Salem as you all know
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh Border Town that is definitively a
 
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.250 align:start position:0%
uh Border Town that is definitively a
target

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
target
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
for those looking to provide charitable
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
gaming not only the operators but the
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
Charities and the charities in the
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
surrounding areas it's a great pool back
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
back when they were trying to pass the
 
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.270 align:start position:0%
back when they were trying to pass the
uh

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
Casino legislation
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
the folks in my town overwhelmingly
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
supported the legislature did not and in
 
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
2006 we ended up with what we have for
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
model now charitable gaming
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
with the shared Revenue structure
 
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
with the shared Revenue structure
so

01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
in the passage of the HHR
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
The Operators if they
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
submit to Lottery and I'm sure a lottery
 
01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
can testify to this they have to patch
 
01:03:10.809 --> 01:03:10.819 align:start position:0%
pass a very thorough background
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
financial and criminal check
 
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.630 align:start position:0%
financial and criminal check
and

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
it's up to the commission to designate
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
one or all of those 14 facilities to be
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
eligible to provide HHR
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
what I've noticed while we'll roll back
 
01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
a little bit that that with uh the
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
rollout from uh from Gel car it was kind
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
of stagnated time wise and and again uh
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
Lottery can
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
testify to this I I'm not exactly sure
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
how many of the game operators applied
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
for HHR licenses how many have received
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
HHR licenses and are currently operating
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
or how many may still be in the process
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
of the licensing and background checks
 
01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:08.930 align:start position:0%
of the licensing and background checks
nonetheless

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose for the July 1 uh
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
moratorium date
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
was was fixed in part as to be able to
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
review the the effects of HHR the new
 
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.010 align:start position:0%
review the the effects of HHR the new
game

01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:29.180 align:start position:0%
and uh how things were working out
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
in my experience over the last year or
 
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.430 align:start position:0%
in my experience over the last year or
so

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure many of you who are in tune
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
with what's going on with uh charitable
 
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:43.460 align:start position:0%
gaming there's been some
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
passing of the torch there's been some
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
larger operators some multinational
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
operators so some big big companies big
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
players coming into our state and buying
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
up these local charitable gaming rooms
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
and we can all draw our own conclusions
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
as to why that has happened and I can
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
also also attest to the fact that again
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
Salem being
 
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
in its geographical place
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:19.579 align:start position:0%
we we in New Hampshire have 14 Gaming
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
facilities 14 charitable Gaming
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
facilities in all of New England these
 
01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:29.059 align:start position:0%
Mega casinos in Everett uncansville
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
boxwoods and others Oxford there are a
 
01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
total of nine casinos in New England we
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have 14 Gaming
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
I'm a free market person
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
make no mistake but we set limits we set
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
limits currently on Gaming facilities
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm of the belief and this is the major
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
component of this particular piece of
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm of the belief that we
 
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.250 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm of the belief that we
should

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
allow for these 14 licenses there may be
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
others out there that have not
 
01:06:11.099 --> 01:06:12.049 align:start position:0%
others out there that have not
um

01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
finished up the the process but all of
 
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
the belief that we should not have to
 
01:06:19.329 --> 01:06:19.339 align:start position:0%
use a term from
 
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
testimony less biennium
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
have slot barns showing up on every
 
01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:25.970 align:start position:0%
have slot barns showing up on every
corner

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
corner
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a place for
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming a great place we have
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
some probably I'm guessing probably 1100
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
Charities that can be serviced I belong
 
01:06:38.529 --> 01:06:38.539 align:start position:0%
to many of those charities
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
and they do great work there's also a
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
saturation point I own some property
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
myself in Nova Scotia and I can tell you
 
01:06:51.609 --> 01:06:51.619 align:start position:0%
that I can walk into any restaurant Pub
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
corner store
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
in other places in this video gaming
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
there I don't want to see that in our
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.349 align:start position:0%
our state
so

01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
announcer prevention is worth a pound of
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
cure here relative to this particular
 
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.589 align:start position:0%
cure here relative to this particular
component

01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:12.109 align:start position:0%
 
secondly

01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
another piece that I would deem more or
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
less housekeeping
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
is the maximum bet component of this at
 
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
present a a player can sit at a
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
blackjack table in one of the charitable
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
gaming rooms and place a bet at a
 
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
um but I that same player can also go to
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
the 7-Eleven on the corner and buy a
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
scratch ticket for 25
 
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:42.020 align:start position:0%
there just should be some Equity here
 
01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
and it allows for uh all involved to
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
reap the benefits of uh the revenue most
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
specifically the Charities and it keeps
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
us in line with what the lottery
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
commission's already doing we already
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
thirdly is the employees the licenses
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
for these employees
 
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
they're required to go through a
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
criminal background check a
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting process annually
 
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
which they have to pay out of pocket
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
and also pay the state I believe it's a
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar fee for the annual
 
01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.030 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar fee for the annual
license

01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
this would extend that to a three-year
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
period for the license with the caveat
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
of reporting to the state any changes in
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
their status
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh criminal history or anything of that
 
01:08:38.699 --> 01:08:40.189 align:start position:0%
uh criminal history or anything of that
nature

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
it also changes this definitions in in
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
the piece of legislation uh talking
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
about uh primary game operator and uh
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
primary game employer
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
a primary game operator in in short is
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
basically a floor manager a Pit Boss or
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
somebody who's managing the charitable
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
gaming facility
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
so he's the foreman on the job and the
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
way the law is written right now he also
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
has to get an annual license but has to
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
pay a premium pay a 500 annual fee for
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm proposing to roll that back to
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
the 100 and also make it to three year
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
primary employer is still paying a 750
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
licensing fee I'm not touching that but
 
01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.249 align:start position:0%
licensing fee I'm not touching that but
uh

01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's nonsensical for the foreman to be
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
paying a
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
a 500 fee plus the background checks
 
01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.090 align:start position:0%
a 500 fee plus the background checks
annually

01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the rest is
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
is pretty much cleanup talking about
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
photo requirements and such but that
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
that rolls into the initial licensing
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
there's another component that speaks to
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
like many employees in the state
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh that there's a problem with the
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of employees
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
so some of them may work part-time in
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
one particular facility work part-time
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
in another facility in this legislation
 
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:24.260 align:start position:0%
also allows for them to not have to be
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
licensed in each they can
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh basically transfer their their
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
clearance to another
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
diligently trying to take notes here I
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
don't like acronyms you use one what's
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
HHR stand for uh historic horse racing
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
those are those machines that were
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
spoken of so lengthy over the past few
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
years and they finally get passed into
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
law last year in some of the uh
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
charitable game operators are at present
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
operating but I know some may or may not
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
some may still be in the process of
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
going through the clearances for that
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it occurs to me we have a lot of
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
new people to this committee who have
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
never heard about any of this my
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
apologies so um we do have the Lottery
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
Commission here behind you so they can
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
maybe do that if you're not comfortable
 
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
doing that any other questions for yes
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Almy this is rather a
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
long question as you know on
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to fight this
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
proliferation for a long time on I would
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
like you to go through and tell and tell
 
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
us what each change is doing
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
I can do that
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
there are severe problems in my
 
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.090 align:start position:0%
there are severe problems in my
communities

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:46.100 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
on yeah
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
yeah well she probably shouldn't have
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
said that because it was
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
a comment about the problems in my
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know that it
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
that'll address specifics to that but I
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
can tell you uh
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the changes that are basically made in
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
this what I I blanketly said was
 
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
this what I I blanketly said was
housekeeping

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
okay

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
but why
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
do you include game operator employer
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
why do you
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
get rid of primary game operator in the
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
second one is okay thank you for the
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
question it's
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
simply uh the game uh primary game
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
operator at one point in time early on
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
they were probably in making an
 
01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:47.900 align:start position:0%
assumption now and somebody else can
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
testify to this was probably the primary
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
employer of that establishment now
 
01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
adding the the definition of uh game
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
operated goe game operator employer that
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
is the employer The Entity that employs
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
a primary game operator who is
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
like I said before probably a floor
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
supervisor the deforming on shift
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
so that definitively two different
 
01:13:21.239 --> 01:13:25.250 align:start position:0%
so that definitively two different
things

01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
Schamberg has a question I'm sorry this
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
is for the entire document oh you're
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
going through the up sorry
 
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.090 align:start position:0%
going through the up sorry
continue

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think that gets us down to line 10.
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
fans who must get the primary game
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
operator license I've already explained
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
oh ooh something I did miss it removes
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
the fingerprint requirement for the
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
member list of the charity applicants
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
back in the Inception in the early years
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
of charitable gaming as a charity you
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
had to be on site in a lot I know at
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
least in Salem when it was at Rock Park
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
we had to literally handle the money as
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
as poker tournaments were going off and
 
01:14:29.169 --> 01:14:29.179 align:start position:0%
whatnot not necessarily the case now
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
after the Charities are chosen
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
and they received their dates
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
they're not required any longer to be on
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
premises during those hours of operation
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
so subsequently why would we need to do
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
a background check on the treasurer of
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
it eliminates language about a licensed
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
equipment dealer again others can speak
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
to you on I'm sorry which page I'm not
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
all right just
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I can just give you an overview of
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
the changes that have done a synopsis
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
what I wanted was Page by page so I'll
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
just have to try it
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
spend hours figuring this out right what
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
I can do representative if you like I
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
can provide for the committee a synopsis
 
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh item for item as to what's changing
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
this and I expect to do that anyway I
 
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
did not do that this morning
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
but uh obvious reasons there's some very
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
that I can uh single out for the
 
01:15:59.689 --> 01:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
committee that'll be easy to navigate
 
01:15:59.699 --> 01:16:03.430 align:start position:0%
committee that'll be easy to navigate
through

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay does it make sense because we have
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that would like to speak
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
on this bill that um representative you
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
could follow up with a synopsis of the
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
key things it does and then where to
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
find it in the bill it seems like that
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful we do have a
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
couple other hands up representative
 
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.510 align:start position:0%
couple other hands up representative
Schamberg

the second question are there any
restrictions

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
by state law or federal law to limit it
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
to individuals or domestic corporations
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
the state yeah okay thank you and let me
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
just say also
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
when do you see me with a laptop I had a
 
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
problem with my printer this morning or
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
I would have provided these things for
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
you and and again apologies you can see
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling we'll see you back here
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah okay uh represent any of us are
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
sympathetic yes representative fellows I
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
think hit her hand up
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm not too too sure like who
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
to ask this question one of the my
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
problems is that
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
some of these sections repeal what was
 
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
there and changed it to something so I
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the what what's going
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
on in terms of the change but in terms
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
of Licensing
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
confuse you have so many levels of
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
Licensing I think that
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
the the employees are those all in the
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
um oplc licenses but but for the whole
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
facility the whole who whoever gets the
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
license to say you can even do this that
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
it is and I'm sure Lottery can
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
yeah we have the experts right behind
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet who hopefully will
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
come up and say what they want to say
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
okay good any other yes representative
 
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.169 align:start position:0%
okay good any other yes representative
Britain

01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
Britain
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
the license once you get a license
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
um what is the limitation like a size a
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
facility that you could can do or is it
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
just the sky's the limit
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and excuse me but regarding um you
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
know the chairs offer to uh at least
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
check out the facility that you haven't
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
conquered I'd like to take you up on
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
that I've never been to one and it'd be
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
kind of good to see something like that
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
but well as you just mention I think
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
what represent Ames was talking about
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
there was a committee and they went on
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
field trips to different locations right
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's always something you
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
should consider doing you might have one
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
in your community or near your community
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
go check it out yeah okay
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions from representative
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
Doucet is there a size limitation on the
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
facility and what's you get a license we
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
can ask that of the commission that is
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
something that they would know
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Phyllis that's one
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is there any other state
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
that has this model with the
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
um charitable portion of it does do any
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
other states do anything like that
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge not not like we do
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent representative
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
first I want to apologize as noted
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
before there are two very very similar
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
bills one in the Senate one in the house
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
we drafted fiscal notes for both
 
01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:43.580 align:start position:0%
through an error on my part in monolone
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
one was not submitted to you folks one
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
was submitted to the house I saw the
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
calendar Friday that indeed that was the
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
case or my admin forwarded Monday
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
morning first thing and so somewhere in
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
your vast
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
edifice exists our fiscal note which was
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
drafted in time but once again I
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed it over vacation and the worst
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing you could do is read an email now
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's a red email and you look like when
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
you go back to Vacation you miss it so
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
the fault is mine and I apologize to the
 
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
chair the members of the committee so a
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
number of the questions that you would
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
ask are answered in that fiscal note at
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
several Pages it goes through the detail
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
of the changes to the law uh the the
 
01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
definitions as well as the finances
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
involved and so uh certainly we can
 
01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
answer the questions you want to have
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
now or we're happy to come back another
 
01:21:33.239 --> 01:21:34.610 align:start position:0%
now or we're happy to come back another
time

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
um after you've had a chance to review
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
it and once again the fault is mine and
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to lead with that Madam
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%

01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative just so we don't have to
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
look through the edifice to find it
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%

yes representative Albany I think we
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%

to get the new members a background of
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%

01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
facilities domestic individuals or
 
01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:57.140 align:start position:0%
domestic corporations or multinational
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
corporation or individuals
 
01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:01.070 align:start position:0%
corporation or individuals
um

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly they're domestic
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of their U.S based uh I don't
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
think they have any interests outside
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
but they have interest in other states
 
01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:11.810 align:start position:0%
but they have interest in other states
follow-up

01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
and are there any restrictions by state
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
law or federal law to limit the
 
01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.110 align:start position:0%
law or federal law to limit the
individuals

01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
or these domestic corporations and
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
if if you mean where they can send their
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
revenue as in the charitable Revenue
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
then it has to remain in New Hampshire
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
so the Charities that they that benefit
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
from these game dates would be new
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.490 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you but
 
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.209 align:start position:0%
thank you but
um by

01:24:50.209 --> 01:24:50.219 align:start position:0%
um by
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
uh the way that the historic horse
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
racing which I see in the meat social
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
media and print media only referred to
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
as slot machines now on it has a very
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
large payment goes to the uh place in
 
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
South Carolina Florida which on
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
which runs those machines remotely
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
um certainly the the breakdown is what
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
it is it's three quarters goes to the
 
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.870 align:start position:0%
it is it's three quarters goes to the
operator

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
operator
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
and all their expenses 25 is split
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
between the state and the Charities
 
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
um the individual Arrangements that each
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
of the operators has are made with the
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
what you would call content and
 
01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:36.890 align:start position:0%
what you would call content and
manufacturers

01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
is between them
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
um I I have an estimate as to what it is
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
and it varies by facility and a number
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh follow up and then representative
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
fellows so
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
so we do not have a right to find out
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
I mean certainly we can
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
we we do have those one of the
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
difficulties is the application process
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
is confidential by law and so I don't
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
know what I can divulge publicly as to
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers break down various contracts
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
so I the answer is I think we can get
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
that information I don't know if I can
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
I would could you just give me some
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
clarification on that statement you just
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
made about
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
um where the money goes you were taught
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
I think you were talking just about the
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
horse racing but in general
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
that that I I want to understand the
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
business model and what's going on
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
because you've got the gambling and that
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
money part some percentage of that is
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
going to charity and some percentage of
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is going to the state
 
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.750 align:start position:0%
that is going to the state
um

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if these entities I assume
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
they make a lot of money off off the
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
food and and things that are not part of
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
the the gambling so I'm just trying to
 
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
I've never been to one and I'm just
 
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
wondering like what is going what's
 
01:27:23.209 --> 01:27:23.219 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
um certainly so each of the facilities
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
is different in the sense of what they
 
01:27:29.689 --> 01:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
offer inside
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so I'll take for example the
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
facility which has essentially all of
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
the revenue streams that you would
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
imagine it could so we'll say the brook
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
which is in Seabrook New Hampshire
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
it has table games for which the state
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
receives a significant portion of the
 
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.110 align:start position:0%
receives a significant portion of the
funds

01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
Richard receives the funds
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the facility receives the funds and
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
I can get you the numbers on that
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
it has historic horse racing for which
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
as I explained the operator would retain
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
75 percent to pay all the expenses then
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
the Charities and the state split 25
 
01:28:05.159 --> 01:28:06.290 align:start position:0%
the Charities and the state split 25
percent

01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
they also have a license for sports
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
betting where
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I saw the eyes you asked I'm
 
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
surely happy to go into this um and so
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
which the there's a DraftKings facility
 
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
within that DraftKings the facility and
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
us split the profits on that
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
they also have food and beverages for
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
which their revenues are theirs we don't
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
go into that
 
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
they also have a simulcast license for
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
which they will display horse racing and
 
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
individuals can go there and bet on
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
01:28:41.159 --> 01:28:42.770 align:start position:0%
horse racing
yes

01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
yes I'm okay so it's a live horse race
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
someplace else shown on a TV screen they
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
can bet on live
 
01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.550 align:start position:0%
can bet on live
um

01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that once again is split most of the
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
money goes to the operator and the track
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
that is showing the race we receive a
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
small amount
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
that's essentially the the the the gamut
 
01:29:01.739 --> 01:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
that's essentially the the the the gamut
of

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
activity within a facility and it varies
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
off of that what each facility does to
 
01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
what extent
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
and every time you were saying we were
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
you you were meaning the state so
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
there's just a limited
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
where where does the chair or did were
 
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
you did it mean State and charity where
 
01:29:26.689 --> 01:29:26.699 align:start position:0%
I said we was the state receives funding
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
for this and the rest of Charities the
 
01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
chair receives funding for this yes
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
so I actually representative if it helps
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send over a breakdown of
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
what each
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
web share model is in terms of each
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
thing that happens within the facility
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
if that would make sense to you the
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
folks and sort of any and all
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
information you could provide the
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
members of this committee would be very
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
helpful and again we'll do a work
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
session too because it's a little bit
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
confusing in Matrix form would be great
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
so you could go down and say this one
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
does that this one does that yes we're
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
happy to do it that could be no more
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
than two pages of a breakdown of each
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
each event
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
each function and what the revenue
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
breakdown is
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
all right I saw a hand over here
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative liply um just to clarify
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's what my question was was
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
to request that information I'm thinking
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
about the presentations we've seen from
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
um agencies kind of to help us
 
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
understand the revenue overall and I'm
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
thinking that same model
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
um with the revenue broken down by each
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
um different manner of betting would be
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
ideal thank you for that just to clarify
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair to the member you mean just
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
in charitable gambling right not the
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
overall Lottery breakdown because we
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
have there's two different sides of the
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
house it was more than that but so I'm
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
trying to remember what we've seen from
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission in other
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
presentations so yes whatever was not
 
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
already covered in the presentation if
 
01:31:03.729 --> 01:31:03.739 align:start position:0%
we could get that background information
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful thank you
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
sure yeah whatever you can do yes
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative all me and just to
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
clarify on that this year we didn't get
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
real breakdowns as I recall on on the
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
different forms of gambling and how much
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
how what their revenue swore this year
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
we just got the overall number
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly I was waiting for an
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
invitation as to the
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
after the governor's budget is submitted
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
in terms of the revenue breakdown
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
obviously that number was still in flux
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
because obviously as an executive branch
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
we're asked to make a revenue estimate
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
late fall early winter and then to
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
update that as the budget draws near and
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
I think we made that estimate
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative I think it was last
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
Friday so certainly the information was
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
changing as we
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
were getting on so happy to come back
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
and give a revenue estimate breakdown by
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
category as well as a work session or
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative having not dived deeply
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
into this bill but scanning it it looks
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
like it's fairly Broad and covers not
 
01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.149 align:start position:0%
like it's fairly Broad and covers not
only

01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
the charity gaming but all gaming and so
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
I would like to see The Matrix cover all
 
01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
gaming about what covers charity what
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
the sure thing I mean certainly within
 
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:26.300 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that we didn't send you
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
admittedly uh as a breakdown of
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
certainly the changes Val does it
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
remarkably um thorough job on these
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
things and so that should help explain a
 
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
bunch of it
 
01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:41.270 align:start position:0%
bunch of it
um

01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
when you do do that
 
01:32:46.739 --> 01:32:47.629 align:start position:0%
when you do do that
um

01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:50.300 align:start position:0%
explanation or presentation on the
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
breakout of how the revenues are
 
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.290 align:start position:0%
breakout of how the revenues are
allocated

01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to explain
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
what the revenues are
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
so in historic horse racing for example
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
as I recall the statute
 
01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.729 align:start position:0%
as I recall the statute
allows

01:33:06.729 --> 01:33:06.739 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
is mutual betting but allows the
 
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh what is it the commission the
 
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
commission The Entity that's running the
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
historic racing the casino to take out
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
12 percent from the pool and then that's
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
the revenue that then is allocated out
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
so that's an example of just being clear
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
on what we're talking about so in the
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
end it's 35 percent of 12 percent
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually that's correct
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it's 25 of 30 of 12 is
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so and also that number varies it's a
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
12 is not a fixed number it's it varies
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
by facility and The Operators will say
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
floor mix as to what machines are where
 
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
and if they pay out
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just a follow-up follow-up
 
01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.669 align:start position:0%
yeah just a follow-up follow-up
um

01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
and that that just triggers this further
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh requests really that um if you can
 
01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:10.100 align:start position:0%
update us on
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
how it's playing out because when we did
 
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
um the estimate was I mean the all the
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
all the numbers assumed 12 percent
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
but the statute itself says up to 12
 
01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.209 align:start position:0%
but the statute itself says up to 12
percent

01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I know some in Kentucky and some
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
other places uh were leaving more in the
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
pool so it was
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
more like 10 percent uh taken out and I
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
just don't know how it's playing out if
 
01:34:41.689 --> 01:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
you have any information on that that
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
would be helpful certainly we would have
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
that information as as a whole of the
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
state as well as by facility
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
and that decision is made by the
 
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
for now
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
certainly the the work session we would
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to discuss each
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
individual points as well that we might
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
have issues with so sort of leaving my
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
thumb on the chess piece essentially
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay well it sounds like you have a long
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
request list thank you very much we will
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
try to schedule this out we also have
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates we have to do soon so
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out what works yeah
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
certainly uh our calendar is yours thank
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
okay we will see them back so don't
 
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
don't be worried okay we will now
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
recognize Rick Newman from the New
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%

01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:35:48.239 --> 01:35:48.850 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair

um
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
Excuse excuse me my name is Rick Newman
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire charitable
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
gaming operators Association
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh which is a Association made up of the
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
14 facilities that operate charitable
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
gaming in New Hampshire
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
and we are here today
 
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh to support the bill
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
many of your questions that you asked
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
are excellent questions and I understand
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know some members of this
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
committee have dealt with charitable
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
gaming for years and others it's a new
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
subject to them and I think I'm happy to
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
be a resource to answer questions if I
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
can and I know the lottery will be
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
helpful in that regard I'd like to just
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you and
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
a few of the changes that it makes to
 
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
I think representative Doucette was
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
correct that many of the things in the
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill are really sort of housekeeping and
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
they are issues that were brought um
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
from the lottery to the study committee
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
that representative Ames and Doucet
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
served on items such as no longer
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
requiring the charity members to be
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted every year it's because
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
they don't participate directly in the
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that really is
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
something that is outdated it's
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
cumbersome it costs the money it's just
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
not necessary so that's sort of A change
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
is something that I would consider to be
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
really to be a housekeeping change I
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
think the primary
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
policy changes in the bill I believe in
 
01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:28.219 align:start position:0%
my view there are there are about four
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the the largest one is the
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
language that Fred representative
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
Doucette was talked about in the
 
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
limiting language or what he referred to
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
as the moratorium
 
01:37:42.169 --> 01:37:42.179 align:start position:0%
current law says that
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
with regard to Historic horse racing
 
01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
with regard to Historic horse racing
machines

01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
only those facilities that were already
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
licensed and there are 14 of them can
 
01:37:55.129 --> 01:37:55.139 align:start position:0%
have historic horse racing machines and
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
that remains the case until July 1 of
 
01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.649 align:start position:0%
that remains the case until July 1 of
2024.

01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
after that anyone operating a charitable
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
gaming facility would be eligible to
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
apply for historic horse racing under
 
01:38:13.149 --> 01:38:13.159 align:start position:0%
the current law this bill
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
repeals that July 1 24 date so it would
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
mean that only the 14 current facilities
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
would continue to be eligible for
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing if that change is
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
made now I would point out
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
that has no effect on how many
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming facilities there are
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
you could open up a charitable gaming
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
facility tomorrow and offer all the
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
games that are allowed under law with
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
the exception of historic horse racing
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
you can offer roulette Blackjack craps
 
01:38:49.199 --> 01:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
you can offer roulette Blackjack craps
poker

01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
poker
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
all of those uh and if you're eligible
 
01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
you if you qualify you could get a
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
license tomorrow I would point out that
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
since in the last three years there has
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
not been a new applicant for a
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming facility despite the
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
fact that they could so I think that's
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
important to note
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
the other major policy change here is
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
the maximum uh wager under the current
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
law the maximum uh wager that you can
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
bet on Blackjack craps roulette is ten
 
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.590 align:start position:0%
bet on Blackjack craps roulette is ten
dollars

01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would raise that to 25. it
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
would also raise what's called
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
tournament buy-ins buy-in is the amount
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
of money you pay to enter a tournament
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
currently the maximum buy-in allowed
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
under the largest 250 dollars this would
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
raise that to 2500.
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
now that may seem like that may seem
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
like a big leap and I don't think we're
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to see very many twenty five
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar tournaments in New
 
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar tournaments in New
Hampshire

01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:39:56.810 --> 01:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's possible that down
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
the road somebody might want to run like
 
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
a big tournament once a year or
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
something but we need the changes in the
 
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
wager and the tournament to be able to
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
stay competitive with what goes on
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
around us in other states people can
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
drive to Oxford in Maine or to Encore
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
down in Everett or Eve Foxwoods and they
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
can play table games at a much higher
 
01:40:23.570 --> 01:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
rate than the 10 maximum that we have
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of one of the reasons one of the
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
issues that comes up with regard to the
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming facilities relative to
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
the wager is
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the wager limit limits the
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
revenue to the facility which limits the
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
amount of money available to pay
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
employees now with all that we know has
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
been going on since covet and all the
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
issues related to any business getting
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
employees I can tell you can represent
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
to you that the pay rate the pay rates
 
01:40:58.370 --> 01:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
of dealers and other employees these
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
facilities has risen dramatically just
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
to be able to retain them
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
and the game operators need
 
01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
to have a wager increase
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
partly to be able to continue to pay the
 
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:12.980 align:start position:0%
employees the larger
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
wages that they're getting that they
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
were getting versus five years ago
 
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
so um but it really is about when it
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
comes particularly to the tournaments
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's about competition poker players
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
will travel uh you there are lots of
 
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
Poker forums that you can log into and
 
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
you read and people talk about they're
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
traveling to New York and they're
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
traveling you know they'll drive 100 200
 
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
300 miles to go to a competitive poker
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
tournament and that happens throughout
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
New England and right now we're limited
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
to a Max of 250 we can have one
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
tournament a day at 250 and that just is
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
not competitive with surrounding states
 
01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason that we need we're
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
asking for the increase and I think the
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
third thing is the changing of the
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
licenses from one year to three and I
 
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
just point out I think it was
 
01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative fellows who asked the
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
question about licensing
 
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
every employee associated with gaming in
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
the facility has to have some kind of a
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
license so you have a game operator
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
employer that's the owner primary game
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
operators are basically shift
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
supervisors of people who are manager
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
aerial and then secondary game
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
operators are the other employees people
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
who are dealers and that sort of thing
 
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
work the cage but all of them go through
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
a licensing process
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
under the current law they are required
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
to get fingerprinted and a criminal
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
background check every year this changes
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
that to three every third every three
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
years and we just think that's efficient
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
it does require that they keep the
 
01:42:56.689 --> 01:42:56.699 align:start position:0%
commission up to date on any changes
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
that affect their licensing and that's
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%
done by filing an annual report and
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
paying the fee they otherwise would have
 
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.410 align:start position:0%
paying the fee they otherwise would have
paid

01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:06.950 align:start position:0%
paid
um

01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
we just think those that changes will be
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
very helpful and it's it seems like you
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
know we've got about a thousand
 
01:43:17.689 --> 01:43:17.699 align:start position:0%
employees in charitable gaming and
 
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
um you know right now every single one
 
01:43:21.649 --> 01:43:21.659 align:start position:0%
of them have to go get fingerprinted
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
somewhere and go through a criminal
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
background check every year we don't
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
think that's necessary
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
and one final thing I will say is
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's uh that I think is a significant
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
policy change in the bill is the current
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
law Maxes the bond requirement for the
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
facility at five hundred thousand
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and this bill raises that to a
 
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
million and we think that's a good
 
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
change too particularly with the
 
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
addition of historic horse racing
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
so with that Madam chair I would ask for
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
your support of the bill happy to answer
 
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
any questions and work with any
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that you may have
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative Allman thank you just
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
clear something up I think it was
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative fellows who assumed that
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
the employees were on regulated by olpc
 
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
but uh in this case it's all lottery
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
right that is correct they're they're
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
not they're regulated by the lottery
 
01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:18.050 align:start position:0%
not they're regulated by the lottery
only

01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative jinnigan
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.169 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that going to 25 would
 
01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
help us be more competitive as a as a
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
state is 25 competitive or what are
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
um actually two two parts of that one is
 
01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:37.629 align:start position:0%
um actually two two parts of that one is
25

01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
Max wager and also the twenty five
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars you talked about are
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
both those numbers competitive with
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
other states do they need to be higher
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
or is that a good number Most states in
 
01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:49.820 align:start position:0%
fact I think all of them have no
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
statutory limit on Wagers in their
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
Casino so
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
um I think the facilities for my
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
experience has been facilities will
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
oftentimes limit you'll see 500 dollars
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
is typical at Foxwoods for instance is
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
the maximum wager you can make so in
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
terms of what are is 25 competitive with
 
01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
Encore no because Encore has unlimited
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
wages frankly
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think the legislature would give
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
us unlimited wages we'd certainly like
 
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
to have it but so we're trying to move
 
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
the ball a little as we've done over the
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
past 18 years
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire's approach to gambling
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
is unique in that the question was asked
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
whether states do it this way the answer
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
to that is no every other state that has
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
what you would call you know casino type
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
gambling it's commercial gambling with
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
the no charity component and with
 
01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
ulery and then Ames
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much could you uh please
 
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
discuss how we have 14 licenses which
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
would remain the same
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
and would not expand
 
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.430 align:start position:0%
and would not expand
so

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
is there a competitive market for that
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
01:46:15.179 --> 01:46:16.430 align:start position:0%
if we were to
um

01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
cap the The Market at 14 would that
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
limit any future ghost of growth of this
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
industry or would it lead to what I seem
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
to see taking place larger corporations
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
buying the license of a smaller
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operation to
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
conglomerate it into a let's say a uh a
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
residential destination Casino
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
could you discuss that I don't think I
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
can answer the second part of your
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
question but I would want to clarify we
 
01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
don't limit the number of Charity Gaming
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
facilities that can exist in New
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now you can we there
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
could potentially be a hundred two
 
01:47:01.689 --> 01:47:01.699 align:start position:0%
hundred whatever
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
anybody can apply and if you're if you
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
qualify you can get a charitable gaming
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
license okay so we do only have 14 right
 
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
license okay so we do only have 14 right
now

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:47:13.330 --> 01:47:13.340 align:start position:0%
the limit that is in place right now is
 
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
those are the only 14 places where
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing can take place
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay so if you were to open up a
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operation in Plaistow
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
for instance you could have all the
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
games that the other rooms have except
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
the HHR machines so there is no limit I
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
would as I pointed out my testimony
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
there has not been a new applicant or a
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
new facility open uh in the last
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I think probably five years uh which
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
says to me
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're at a good spot in terms of what
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
the market can bear if there were
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities for others to make money
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
in it I would assume that people would
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
follow up uh thank you
 
01:48:07.609 --> 01:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
um so let's say you have a
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
moderately sized operation in a one of
 
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
the border cities
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
if it were to move into another bigger
 
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.350 align:start position:0%
if it were to move into another bigger
facility

01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
it would expand its the number of tables
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
the number of personnel being employed
 
01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
the number uh number of uh classes of uh
 
01:48:29.410 --> 01:48:29.420 align:start position:0%
adult beverages that were being served
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh all that would take place and if we
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
were to increase the table stakes and
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
the buy-in for poker games that would
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
attract a larger crowd would it not
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
we would hope it would yes so to follow
 
01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:46.380 align:start position:0%
up on the point
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
on that point would be
 
01:48:48.719 --> 01:48:50.030 align:start position:0%
on that point would be
if

01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
that is that considered a new facility
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
opening up or are they just taking the
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
down here and moving it over there
 
01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
under the current law a facility one of
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
the 14 facilities could do exactly what
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
you just said they could move uh for the
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of having the store course
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
racing they could move from one location
 
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
to another within the same community
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay so yes in that sense it would be
 
01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
moving that license from Main Street to
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
F Street if that were the case and
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
trying to think if anybody's done it
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
um to my knowledge nobody has done it
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
yet but they are working on it in
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and they are working on it in
 
01:49:41.159 --> 01:49:44.270 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and they are working on it in
Salem

01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
and Nashua you're absolutely right they
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
did do it the river moved to a facility
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
now called the lucky moose in Nashua
 
01:49:53.159 --> 01:49:55.490 align:start position:0%
now called the lucky moose in Nashua
yes

01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative Ames had a question
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think you got a question yeah thank
 
01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:02.689 align:start position:0%
I think you got a question yeah thank
you

01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:02.699 --> 01:50:03.649 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:06.770 --> 01:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
this may be too broad but um I received
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
this in the mail which presumably from
 
01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.149 align:start position:0%
this in the mail which presumably from
you

01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um just yesterday as I came home from a
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
long day at the legislature
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is from the New
 
01:50:20.649 --> 01:50:20.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable gaming operators
 
01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
Association which is I think you're
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
that's correct what you're representing
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and it's impressive document oh it
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
has your name on the back
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
um so my that's a backdrop
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh I suppose a side question is did you
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
mail it to everybody sitting here it was
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
that was mailed to all members of the
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
House and Senate okay good
 
01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.810 align:start position:0%
House and Senate okay good
um

01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
this is the broad question how are you
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
doing how's business uh for your casinos
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
are you booming
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
are you struggling because you need uh
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
you're there too many uh limitations on
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
what you do you've got uh Massachusetts
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you know pushing its casinos its big
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
Encore casino it's uh
 
01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know how I was doing post
 
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh covid but now it's post covet and so
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
probably more activity there
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts gotten into sports
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
gaming which I know is not directly
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming but the latest model
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
has like the book has a sports book
 
01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
right there and so it's uh it's part of
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
the deal and part of the attraction how
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
are we doing with this well it is a
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
mixed bag I will tell you the facilities
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
that have opened up historic horse
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
racing which I think are just about half
 
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
of them maybe a couple maybe one or two
 
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
more than half
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
um they're doing those those machines
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
are doing well and generating good
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue they're bringing facilities that
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the past were not making money to be
 
01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:56.629 align:start position:0%
in the past were not making money to be
profitable

01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
01:51:59.090 --> 01:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
um we do see you mentioned the post
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
covet World particularly in
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now there for a long time
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts casinos were not doing
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
poker poker is a very important part of
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
of the casino environment and since they
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
weren't doing it that was benefiting
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
rooms in New Hampshire they are now
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
aggressively getting back into Boca
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
which is why we're asking for the
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
tournament and the wager increase
 
01:52:25.250 --> 01:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
frankly but the tournament uh increased
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
because we want to be able to be
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
competitive with with them we we need
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
that increase in order to do that
 
01:52:31.739 --> 01:52:33.229 align:start position:0%
that increase in order to do that
um so

01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
that has affected the Border you can see
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
the numbers have dropped a little and I
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
anticipate they will drop a little more
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
on the border uh casinos charity casinos
 
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
in particular because of the poker uh
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
marketing that the Encore and others
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
down in Massachusetts are doing overall
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
five years ago there were probably
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
I would say at least half of the charity
 
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
gaming rooms were either breaking even
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
or not making a profit and I believe
 
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
that today I could say that they're
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably all making a profit some small
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
because they don't have HHR yet but uh
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
but HHR certainly helped those that have
 
01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:16.669 align:start position:0%
but HHR certainly helped those that have
it

01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%
I have one follow-up
 
01:53:18.659 --> 01:53:19.729 align:start position:0%
I have one follow-up
yeah

01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:53:19.739 --> 01:53:21.050 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned one of one of the uh
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
Parts changes made in this bill raising
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
the debt limit and the
 
01:53:34.930 --> 01:53:34.940 align:start position:0%
Buy in a number for
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
poker if I've got the right word I don't
 
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.350 align:start position:0%
poker if I've got the right word I don't
know

01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
um is partly a response to competition
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and my question is
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
whether they're whether we should be
 
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
worried and as you might be about uh
 
01:53:57.070 --> 01:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
the potential for
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:54:05.169 --> 01:54:05.179 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
problem gaming is that what you asked
 
01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.290 align:start position:0%
problem gaming is that what you asked
yeah

01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I really am not you're at a higher
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
level of money and interest perhaps an
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
attraction to the game
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
so the only thing I would say is I mean
 
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not qualified really to know if
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
if bigger limits would mean people would
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
would problem gamer would bet more
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
because they have to have the money to
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
bet but I would point out that for
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
instance in sports betting in New
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's no limit on how much
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
you can bet on sports betting and you
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
know you see the ads and watching the
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl you see are ads for places to
 
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
bet on on Sports you can bet on you know
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
who's going to catch the next pass and
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
all that sort of thing and that's going
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
on in New Hampshire today I I honestly
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
believe it's not my bias because I
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
represent charity gaming I honestly
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
believe sports betting presents a much
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
bigger problem potential problem for
 
01:55:03.649 --> 01:55:03.659 align:start position:0%
problem gaming than what you see in a
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
casino environment
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for that Insight thank you
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
my representative Malloy and then
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you
 
01:55:14.689 --> 01:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is
 
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
kind of a follow-up on what
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think was working toward but my
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
question is more direct what would
 
01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:28.100 align:start position:0%
change How would
 
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.750 align:start position:0%
change How would
Unlimited

01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
Unlimited
 
01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.669 align:start position:0%
Unlimited
Wagers

01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
Wagers
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire change
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
our charitable gaming business model
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
here you mentioned earlier
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
that you know the legislature would
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
approve that may not but I'm just
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
curious to know how would if it did if
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
we did how would it change charitable
 
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
gaming here in New Hampshire revenue and
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
all that so excuse me so whether you
 
01:55:56.890 --> 01:55:56.900 align:start position:0%
increase it to 25 or some other number
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
the the biggest change is people tend to
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
go out in groups right we don't I mean
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
most of us we have friends who family
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
you go out with
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
I would say that a vast number of people
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
who bet in casinos want to be at a ten
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
dollar or five dollar table but there
 
01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
are some that want to be at a higher
 
01:56:17.699 --> 01:56:18.530 align:start position:0%
are some that want to be at a higher
table

01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
now if we're going out with four or five
 
01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
of us together
 
01:56:24.129 --> 01:56:24.139 align:start position:0%
and you know I I want to be at a 25
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
blackjack table and you're happy with a
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
five dollar table then all five of us
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
are going to probably end up going
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere a week where we could all get
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
what we want so we lose that business we
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
end up going to Encore instead of
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
stopping a Nash or Salem okay uh it's
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so so raising the state to any level
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
keeps some of that business whatever
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
that limit is going to be we'll keep
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
some of that business right here in New
 
01:56:50.930 --> 01:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the things we find is
 
01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:53.540 align:start position:0%
that yes Encore is a beautiful facility
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
but the facilities that we have are also
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
very well done and the fact that they're
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
smaller they're they are attractive to
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
some players they don't want to go
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
through the you know you need a shuttle
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
to get through the parking lot and and
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know deal with all of the hubbub
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
that happens down at a big Casino so
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
stopping at the brook or stopping in
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
Salem makes sense to them but having
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
that larger bet will mean more of them
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
taking making that stop instead of
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
continuing to the next state
 
01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the way that's the
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
biggest change it will get us
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
make us more competitive
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
to keep more of the customers here in
 
01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question so why is the sports
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
betting a problem you mentioned the next
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
past whatever what's the problem with
 
01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:51.659 align:start position:0%
that no I I was only saying that in
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
terms of the question regarding problem
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
gaming which I am not an expert on at
 
01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:55.609 align:start position:0%
gaming which I am not an expert on at
all

01:57:55.609 --> 01:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:57:57.890 --> 01:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
uh it has just simply been my
 
01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:58.970 align:start position:0%
uh it has just simply been my
observation

01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
observation
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
that because you have so many elements
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
so many ways to bet you can bet every 30
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
seconds or so on an online app in sports
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
betting it would be my opinion
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
not based on any scientific data but my
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
opinion that sports betting is more apt
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
to be a target of people with problem
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
gaming than a charity Casino environment
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay very good follow-up please
 
01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:27.410 align:start position:0%
okay very good follow-up please
so

01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
currently there's these limits on Wagers
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the Charities and the state get 25
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
percent is that what I heard earlier
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
today I don't think you said it but I
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
think I heard it earlier today so just
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be clear on that on the on table
 
01:58:45.530 --> 01:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
games whether it's poker or blackjack or
 
01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
craps the charity gets 35 percent of the
 
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
revenue from those tables and the state
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
gets 10.
 
01:58:55.810 --> 01:58:55.820 align:start position:0%
on historic horse racing
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's 25 percent of the revenue is
 
01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
comes out we call it a takeout
 
01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
and that is split
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
between the state and the charity the
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
charity gets 35 percent of that and the
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
state gets 65 percent of that okay very
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
good so here's my question so what if we
 
01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
were to just
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
take the limits off of everything what
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
is it you would want and what would be
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
the increase to our charities in the
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
state any idea well if you increase uh
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
Wagers whether it's the 25 like this
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill does or some other number I will
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
tell you Senate Bill 120 in the senate
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
for instance has passed the Senate once
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
it has a limit of fifty dollars so that
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll probably see Senate Bill
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
120 at some point I would assume but
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
what would it do to charity Revenue it
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
would do it would lift all boats yeah
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
well my my point was what about the
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
percentage so if we
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
were to give you carte blanche what
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
would you want that cap to be or would
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
we just take the cap off that's what I'm
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
asking and then what would the
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
percentages be back to the state and the
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
Charities that you think we could get in
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
other words I'm saying like you just
 
02:00:05.099 --> 02:00:06.589 align:start position:0%
other words I'm saying like you just
said

02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
whatever if you do if you take the Caps
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
off it's going to raise all the bolts
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying I want to raise
 
02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
the money for the staff I don't gamble I
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
don't care uh how's that full disclosure
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
but what I am asking is if we're to just
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
let you do whatever you wanted to keep
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
the customers to bring them here
 
02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
you know to build a bigger because
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
whatever it is what is it you would want
 
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
and what's the what's the payout to the
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
state I think the uh 35 from tables and
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
10 percent of the state is a fair a
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
division that leaves 55 percent we got
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
into what to wagering because if wager
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
increases that's gonna you're gonna get
 
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
more money to the more dollars to the
 
02:00:49.729 --> 02:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
charity and the state uh 35 and 10 has
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
worked it worked at a two dollar bet
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's working at a ten dollar bet it
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
would work at a 25 bet it would work at
 
02:00:58.490 --> 02:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollar bet okay so would you
 
02:01:01.129 --> 02:01:01.139 align:start position:0%
be in favor of taking the Caps off
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
just take the Caps off right
 
02:01:05.570 --> 02:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
I mean would you be in favor of that and
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
why or why not
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
you mean take the Caps off the Wagers
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah of course I'm sure we would we
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
would be in favor though okay I don't
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
think that's viable but I but we'd
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
certainly be in favor of it I'm in favor
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
of it but we appreciate that thank you
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative always who I saw first
 
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go there
 
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I've got two questions so I'll
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
just ask one now on
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
what is the maximum bet on the historic
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines now and what is
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
the maximum yes uh 25 is the maximum bet
 
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
and this bill would not change that
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that can be done every five seconds
 
02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
I think it could potentially I don't
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
think it's practical but yes right my
 
02:01:58.370 --> 02:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
other questions related but I'll wait
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows thank you I
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
I just wanted clarification on
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
the T when you say from the table games
 
02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
35 goes to charity and 10 goes to the
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
state of 35 and 10 of what it's not the
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
bet it can't be that much it's a very
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
good question representative uh thank
 
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
you uh 35 of what we call in the
 
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
business gross Gaming revenue gross
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue is the money left over
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
after prizes are paid
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
so basically it'll be it's also would be
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
called House win
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
what the house won on that particular
 
02:02:38.159 --> 02:02:41.030 align:start position:0%
what the house won on that particular
table

02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.089 --> 02:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
some sort of percentage that you can
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
tell us related to the bets that are
 
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
going down which Max which the max is
 
02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.270 align:start position:0%
going down which Max which the max is
25.

02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
25.
 
02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.310 align:start position:0%
25.
what

02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't understand the
 
02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.510 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't understand the
question

02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
so what does the gross Gaming revenue
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
what percent is that usually of a bet
 
02:03:08.450 --> 02:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
well that's very difficult to say on a
 
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
table game because
 
02:03:13.129 --> 02:03:13.139 align:start position:0%
there actually are days when a house can
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
lose right I mean you could have
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
somebody get hot on the roulette wheeler
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
on a crap table and at the end of the
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
day the house ends up with a negative
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
number there is no house when so some
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
days you can win some now that doesn't
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
happen very often but it can happen it's
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
unlike for instance historic horse
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
racing whereas representative Ames
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
pointed out the the absolute maximum
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
house win is going to be 12 percent of
 
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
the bets you really can't put a number
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
on the table games like that
 
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's going to be it's going to vary from
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
time to time but if you'll if you will
 
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
let me say this with the caveat that
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
please don't hold me to it
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that I think most people
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the industry would say that something
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
between 15 and 20 percent
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
is about what you can anticipate the
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question thank
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
you for your very cogent kind of
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what we're talking about
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
with the four points that helped me a
 
02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:26.450 align:start position:0%
with the four points that helped me a
lot

02:04:26.450 --> 02:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
lot
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions one is when I
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
volunteer in my school my child's school
 
02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
I have to get fingerprinted
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
so it my question is why would you not
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
want your employees fingerprinted every
 
02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:40.970 align:start position:0%
want your employees fingerprinted every
year

02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
um because it seems like professionally
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's their job to work in gambling and
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
to handle lots of money
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
um is it really such a big inconvenience
 
02:04:56.450 --> 02:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a it's not a game
 
02:04:59.450 --> 02:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
stopper or Game Changer but
 
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:00.649 align:start position:0%
stopper or Game Changer but
um

02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
we think that I mean first of all
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the lottery would know this more
 
02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
than I but
 
02:05:10.450 --> 02:05:10.460 align:start position:0%
I think I would know if we'd ever found
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
an employee getting fingerprinted for
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
Renewal that turned up something that
 
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
ended up getting them denied a license
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
right employees know that I mean if an
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
employee knows they broke the law and
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
they've done something bad in all
 
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
likelihood they're gonna not come back
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
because they know they're going to get
 
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
picked up they're gonna it's gonna get
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
caught so so it seems I guess our
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
position is on that point that it's just
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
redundant that it has to happen every
 
02:05:41.209 --> 02:05:41.219 align:start position:0%
single year and it costs the employee
 
02:05:43.370 --> 02:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
money and it costs time and it's it's
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
inconvenient right it's not something
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we would say is essential to the
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislation but it would certainly be
 
02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
more convenient representative
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you place odds on the passage of this
 
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.129 align:start position:0%
if you place odds on the passage of this
bill

02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not a bookie
 
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.350 align:start position:0%
I'm not a bookie
representative

02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.609 align:start position:0%
representative
on

02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
related to the other question
 
02:06:13.810 --> 02:06:13.820 align:start position:0%
um there are charitable gaming places
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
that put more emphasis on the machines
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
and their charitable gaming places that
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
put more emphasis it looks like on poker
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
and other table games
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
and um in Lebanon there is a small place
 
02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
that most people didn't even know was
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
there on
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
which is in the middle of a area of
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
who are people that would just go to
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
machines usually is there a question
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
here and and it's moving to a place that
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
is next to our major thrift store uh and
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
the cheapest supermarket
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
so um it seems to be that as an example
 
02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
on and then the Brooks seems to be
 
02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
heavily oriented towards getting people
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
in for the other games
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
is there a question there the question
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
was uh how many of these I think they're
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
only eight now with
 
02:07:29.689 --> 02:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
with the machines
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
I I think that may be right it does
 
02:07:34.129 --> 02:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
change that's six that don't even have
 
02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
this question yet but of the ones that
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
have the machines how many of them are
 
02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:40.129 align:start position:0%
have the machines how many of them are
are

02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
um pushing or getting more Revenue out
 
02:07:46.129 --> 02:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
of the machines than they are out of the
 
02:07:51.169 --> 02:07:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
are you asking I'm sorry I don't I'm not
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
clear on the question on their
 
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:04.729 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:08:04.729 --> 02:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
are they making more money out of these
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing machines or are
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
they making more money out of the the
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
other games
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
or are they trying to make more money
 
02:08:23.689 --> 02:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
well I I think obviously to try to
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
maximize Revenue any way they can but I
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
would point out that in the rules that
 
02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
were adopted
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
the facility has to have a ratio of
 
02:08:37.689 --> 02:08:37.699 align:start position:0%
revenue from uh table games
 
02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
versus revenue from machines oh it does
 
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
6.33 it's a factor of six point so the
 
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
revenue for HHR machines
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh cannot exceed I think it's six point
 
02:08:57.890 --> 02:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
three three percent uh 6.33 times the
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
revenue from table games and if it does
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
the the rate goes up from 25 to 50
 
02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:05.209 align:start position:0%
the the rate goes up from 25 to 50
percent

02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a dramatic increase the
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
rate of what the rate of the takeout so
 
02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the charity money goes
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
charity actually ends up getting another
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
25 if it exceeds that ratio
 
02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:26.599 align:start position:0%
what's six and a third times
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
the the amount coming out of the table
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
games correct
 
02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative liply quick
 
02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:39.770 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative liply quick
one

02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:40.790 align:start position:0%
one
um

02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
the speaker has indicated he's not a
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
specialist on problem gaming and
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm wondering if the
 
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
committee could invite someone who could
 
02:09:55.609 --> 02:09:55.619 align:start position:0%
help us understand because when we talk
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
about tobacco or alcohol we know there's
 
02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
a cost to society right of problem uses
 
02:10:03.890 --> 02:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
of that and there would be a cost to
 
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
Society of the problem
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
um gambling and I'm wondering if
 
02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:09.589 align:start position:0%
um gambling and I'm wondering if
um

02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
and this would be bigger it wouldn't
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
just be the charity gambling but it
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be I wonder if the Lottery
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
Commission would be who we could ask
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
yeah because obviously there's a lot of
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
economic charitable gaming is one
 
02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
element of what the Lottery Commission
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
does but they also do scratch tickets
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
and probably other things I don't even
 
02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
know about so I think we'll have to ask
 
02:10:28.490 --> 02:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
them when they return to help us
 
02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
understand that piece I just want to
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that if we're capturing
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
Revenue are we accounting for any cost
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
and do we know there is a special
 
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
fund maybe for that and they would know
 
02:10:43.129 --> 02:10:43.139 align:start position:0%
that so we'll ask them so I can tell you
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
that with the passage of House Bill 626
 
02:10:47.689 --> 02:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
two years ago that authorized historic
 
02:10:49.129 --> 02:10:49.139 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
um there is money that it's called
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
breakage breakage is the leftover
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
pennies that are that accumulate in
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
paramutual wagering and that money goes
 
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
to prob to the problem gaming fund and I
 
02:11:05.209 --> 02:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
can say
 
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
just give you an idea I mean not again
 
02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
what not everybody up and running yet
 
02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
but I believe that's averaging somewhere
 
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
around 11 000 a month the last I saw it
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably growing as more and more
 
02:11:20.209 --> 02:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines come online
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify my question is not
 
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
just what Revenue we're capturing which
 
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's really helpful but also if
 
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's some way that the state is
 
02:11:32.089 --> 02:11:32.099 align:start position:0%
quantifying a cost
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
any other questions we have a few more
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
people who are going to testify on this
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill too so we might be able to ask them
 
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so much thank you
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:11:49.609 --> 02:11:49.619 align:start position:0%
okay we will now recognize Tina Andrade
 
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
from the home health and hospice care
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you so much
 
02:11:57.890 --> 02:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
welcome for allowing us me to speak and
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer another perspective if
 
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
I may
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm um the director of philanthropy
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
for home health and hospice care and the
 
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
community hospice house
 
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
and we were one of the first
 
02:12:15.970 --> 02:12:15.980 align:start position:0%
organizations the charitable
 
02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:19.580 align:start position:0%
non-profits to take advantage of
 
02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:22.580 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I would say that last year
 
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
we received a check for our week that
 
02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
was about 71 000 dollars
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to let you know what we did
 
02:12:37.609 --> 02:12:37.619 align:start position:0%
with that money
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we're an old organization we were
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
founded in 1883
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
still going strong we served 25 cities
 
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
and towns in Southern New Hampshire and
 
02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
on any day we probably have about 500
 
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
patients most of them are cared for in
 
02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
the home setting so we have about 250
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
clinicians and they're driving all over
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and going up to
 
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
people's doors and helping those folks
 
02:13:13.729 --> 02:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
stay independent in their homes in
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
addition to that
 
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
we do Hospice Care in nursing homes in
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
people's homes and in the community
 
02:13:25.129 --> 02:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
hospice house where we have a 10 Suite
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
10 beds where we take care of folks at
 
02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
end of life who for whatever reason and
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different reasons
 
02:13:35.689 --> 02:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
they cannot be cared for in the home
 
02:13:35.699 --> 02:13:37.609 align:start position:0%
they cannot be cared for in the home
setting

02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:37.619 align:start position:0%
setting
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
it has been our mission since 1883 to
 
02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:45.260 align:start position:0%
care for people whatever their financial
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances are
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
and that means if a person has no
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
insurance has no resources we try very
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
desperately to care for them nonetheless
 
02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
and that includes in the community
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
hospice house
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
now I think I should let you know that
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
there are only two hospice houses in the
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
whole state of New Hampshire we're one
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:14:13.729 --> 02:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
and both of them
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
are non-profit organizations we do have
 
02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:20.649 align:start position:0%
are non-profit organizations we do have
um

02:14:20.649 --> 02:14:20.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
for-profit hospices
 
02:14:26.569 --> 02:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
but they don't have hospice houses
 
02:14:29.209 --> 02:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
anywhere not in New Hampshire not across
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
the country and the reason for that is
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
because hospice houses run at a deficit
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
so the rest of our business in the home
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
setting and that's why we're still here
 
02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.089 align:start position:0%
setting and that's why we're still here
today

02:14:44.089 --> 02:14:44.099 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
is because yes that does bring in a
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
revenue to support that work
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
the hospice house does not and in fact
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
even when you have Medicare or private
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
insurance or your own resources every
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
day that a patient is in there we lose
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
probably about a little over four
 
02:15:09.050 --> 02:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a day
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have a philanthropy
 
02:15:12.599 --> 02:15:13.669 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have a philanthropy
Department

02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
and so in a number of different ways we
 
02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
raise money we're a little department
 
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
just four of us and we raise money
 
02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:24.500 align:start position:0%
through events through direct mail
 
02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:26.109 align:start position:0%
through events through direct mail
solicitations

02:15:26.109 --> 02:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
solicitations
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
through Memorial gifts and through
 
02:15:33.890 --> 02:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
grants and now the Brilliance of the
 
02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire in bringing us
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
in little community
 
02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
in little community
casinos

02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
casinos
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
so when we get that wonderful
 
02:15:53.209 --> 02:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
last year 71 000 what that meant
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
very directly
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
is several patients
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
dying in the community hospice house
 
02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any of you have had an
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
experience with someone in hospice
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
or in a community hospice house
 
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
but I have to say that every single day
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
there are notes that come to my desk in
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
the mail
 
02:16:21.370 --> 02:16:21.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes with a five dollar gift
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes with a fifty dollar gift but
 
02:16:27.410 --> 02:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
always always
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
with something that someone wrote about
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
their experience
 
02:16:34.969 --> 02:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
and what amazes me
 
02:16:39.410 --> 02:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
is that despite great sorrow
 
02:16:42.889 --> 02:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
in the loss of a loved one
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
the way people express it is it was the
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
most beautiful experience for us
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
I got a letter recently from a woman
 
02:16:55.490 --> 02:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
whose family member had died four years
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
ago in the hospice house and she retold
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the letter
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
what an incredible experience it was for
 
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
them and she wrote at the time my
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
sisters and I didn't realize it you were
 
02:17:14.089 --> 02:17:14.099 align:start position:0%
taking such wonderful care of our dad
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't realize it but you were also
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
taking great care of us
 
02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important
 
02:17:25.730 --> 02:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
in the big perspective
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
you know to know what our Charities are
 
02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
you know to know what our Charities are
doing

02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
and how absolutely important this is to
 
02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:35.389 align:start position:0%
and how absolutely important this is to
us

02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have the Hospice House
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
people would die anyway
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
but they may die in a hospital setting
 
02:17:46.849 --> 02:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
much more expensive both for families
 
02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
for insurance for the State of New
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for communities and taking
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
up a bed
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
that someone who may go into the
 
02:18:00.049 --> 02:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
hospital and recuperate
 
02:18:02.929 --> 02:18:02.939 align:start position:0%
would be able to have
 
02:18:02.939 --> 02:18:04.209 align:start position:0%
would be able to have
so

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:04.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
we now have the historic horse racing
 
02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:13.250 align:start position:0%
we now have the historic horse racing
machines

02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
machines
 
02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
my organizations weak starts next Monday
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we are so grateful to be able to do
 
02:18:24.889 --> 02:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
this because we know it will directly
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
affect people in our community directly
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
affect them
 
02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
now that we have historic horse racing
 
02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:34.429 align:start position:0%
now that we have historic horse racing
machines

02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
machines
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
there now are two Charities a week
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:18:40.559 --> 02:18:41.330 align:start position:0%
that would be
um

02:18:41.330 --> 02:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
that would receive the gift
 
02:18:49.129 --> 02:18:49.139 align:start position:0%
two Charities a week so I know that this
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
this next week we will receive a
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
charitable gift it won't be quite as
 
02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:57.830 align:start position:0%
charitable gift it won't be quite as
much

02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about raising the bet
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
that a person can make we know lots of
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
people won't go up to the 25 because
 
02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
people just don't they know what their
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
limits are these are small places
 
02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:16.700 align:start position:0%
they're Community places
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's one 10 minutes away from my own
 
02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
house that I've certainly been at and
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
see everybody I know you know it's just
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
it's a safe place people are having fun
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
and most of the bats will be small bats
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
but it would be wonderful to be able to
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
be back at that level that we were
 
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
before because for us
 
02:19:45.049 --> 02:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
that is just I can see patients a woman
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
came up to me at a Rotary meeting on
 
02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
Monday and she had a story and she was
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
saying that she had a friend that needed
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
hospice help but they didn't have any
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
insurance what could we do about it and
 
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
I said please let us know have the
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
doctor refer that patient you know
 
02:20:07.250 --> 02:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why we are a non-profit
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
organization because
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
whether you're a prince or a popper you
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
would get the same exact care at the
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
community hospice house
 
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
and the this particular bill
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
will just simply make it possible for
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
someone else like that to have their
 
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
last few days
 
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
in a place like ours
 
02:20:35.950 --> 02:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
and so I urge you today
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
to consider this perspective I know
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
you've spent a lot of time today talking
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
about the ins and outs of it as you
 
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
should without any question
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire has done a brilliant
 
02:20:54.889 --> 02:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
thing than most other states have done
 
02:20:56.690 --> 02:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
I know you're going to hear from a
 
02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
couple other non-profits
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
um today but I just want you to see
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
very clearly
 
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
what this is doing and it's a good thing
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for me
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir for the record I just want to
 
02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:15.170 align:start position:0%
yes sir for the record I just want to
say

02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um what you do is amazing I've
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
experienced it personally so thank you
 
02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:20.929 align:start position:0%
experienced it personally so thank you
representative

02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
yes I have
 
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
take my composure for a moment
 
02:21:27.530 --> 02:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
um is there a limit to how often you can
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
come to the uh the gaming association
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes only uh once a week
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh could I I forgot I'm sorry getting a
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
little older
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to address the
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting briefly
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
because I have first-hand experience
 
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
so the first year I knew I was the one
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
that would pick up the check so I went
 
02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
down to the police station
 
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know and I did the digital and they
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
sent it up to wherever they send it I
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
think that they send it to the FBI but
 
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
at any rate it came back that they
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't read it so I went back to the
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
police station and they did it with ink
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we did the resent it off and they
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
called me up and said sorry you seem to
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
have no fingerprints
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
and I thought oh perhaps I should have
 
02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
been a cat burglar but at any rate then
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
we went and I had another person in my
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
office go she called the Nashville
 
02:22:32.450 --> 02:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
police department and said could I come
 
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and they said oh no we
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
just brought a whole bunch of criminals
 
02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
in so don't come today
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
the next time I got another person in
 
02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
our office the director of Home Care
 
02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
Lucy and Lucy went to the police station
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
same problem Lucy and I decided she had
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
no fingerprints so Lucy and I decided
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
this probably because we have Ray nodes
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know not our fingers are always cold
 
02:23:02.090 --> 02:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
at any rate what I do want to say about
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
this is I think it's actually
 
02:23:07.730 --> 02:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
probably taxing on the police department
 
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
but although they have to speak for
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
themselves but in our organization you
 
02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
know we have criminal records checks
 
02:23:19.969 --> 02:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
done every single year on every employee
 
02:23:19.979 --> 02:23:22.550 align:start position:0%
done every single year on every employee
because

02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:23:25.610 --> 02:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
we work with people in the community and
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
so just something to think about I
 
02:23:31.969 --> 02:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
suspect that our fellow non-profits
 
02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
probably do the same thing now I'm sorry
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
you did have questions
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
Kevin Jordan sorry it took me a minute
 
02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
to read your first name I should have
 
02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
recognized you apologies from the New
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%

House Ways and Means Committee I've
 
02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
learned a great deal sitting here today
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
A lot that I did not know about gambling
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not a gambler I lost fifty dollars
 
02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
many years ago in Las Vegas and it
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
bothers me to this day
 
02:24:25.849 --> 02:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so I don't do that but I have as a
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
result of my charity uh we have
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
benefited from uh the monies that come
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire for under charity
 
02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:36.050 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire for under charity
gaming

02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
so the law enforcement memorial
 
02:24:39.889 --> 02:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
Association was created many years ago
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
to recognize and memorialize the
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
ultimate sacrifices made by the men and
 
02:24:45.650 --> 02:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
women who have lost their lives while
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire citizens the
 
02:24:49.730 --> 02:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
association also recognizes those
 
02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
sacrifices made by the family and
 
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
friends survivors of these New Hampshire
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
Heroes each year during the month of May
 
02:24:58.010 --> 02:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
out here on the front lawn as most of
 
02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
you know we hold a ceremony during law
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement week to honor those
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
sacrifices and to memorialize those
 
02:25:04.319 --> 02:25:05.450 align:start position:0%
sacrifices and to memorialize those
officers

02:25:05.450 --> 02:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:25:08.450 --> 02:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
as a non-profit which we are our
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
greatest challenge has always been
 
02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:10.969 align:start position:0%
greatest challenge has always been
fundraising

02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
fundraising
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
we don't receive any state funding for
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
this organization we operate solely
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
based upon donations
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
the cost to hold these annual ceremonies
 
02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
during Police Week each year continues
 
02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
to increase and the currently the cost
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
for this event alone near seven thousand
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
dollars annually we put the flowers in
 
02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
and maintain the memorial grounds out
 
02:25:33.950 --> 02:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
here as well each year
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
so a few years ago we quite by luck were
 
02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
offered the opportunity to participate
 
02:25:41.570 --> 02:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
in the charitable gaming and that was my
 
02:25:43.250 --> 02:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
first exposure to that and we partnered
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
up with Boston Billiards in Nashua New
 
02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through this young lady
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me Gia
 
02:25:50.570 --> 02:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm I'm here to tell you that
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
certainly saved our organization
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
um we no longer have to struggle to get
 
02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
enough donations to maintain the
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
memorial or the grounds surrounding that
 
02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
site out front here we've been able to
 
02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
meet the cost of conducting an annual
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
ceremony for the families
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
we do support the change uh in this bill
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
and the increase in the ability to place
 
02:26:10.849 --> 02:26:10.859 align:start position:0%
bets from the current ten dollars to a
 
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
25 limit one of the concerns I had when
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
I when I asked about this change was the
 
02:26:17.809 --> 02:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
fact that there are New Hampshire
 
02:26:19.610 --> 02:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
citizens are quite possibly New
 
02:26:21.650 --> 02:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens that are leaving our
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
state to spend this money in other
 
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
states to me that makes no sense I would
 
02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
like to see the state New Hampshire
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
economy benefit from that it seems like
 
02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
a modest change to me
 
02:26:35.929 --> 02:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important for us to
 
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
promote our own economy and encourage
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
those people to place those vets here in
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not only help our economy
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
it'll benefit the very valuable
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
non-profits that that also benefit from
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
this charity gaming
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to Echo the concerns or the
 
02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
or the praise really for the legislature
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
to take you know sitting here I'm
 
02:26:56.330 --> 02:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
watching this and you're taking very
 
02:26:59.090 --> 02:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
careful contemplation of all of this and
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that as a citizen I think
 
02:27:02.929 --> 02:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
it's important to me I have mixed I've
 
02:27:04.690 --> 02:27:04.700 align:start position:0%
always had mixed feelings about gambling
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
but I've also had an opportunity now to
 
02:27:09.650 --> 02:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
see the benefits from it when it's
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
controlled and managed and I believe
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
that you folks are doing a very good job
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
trying to do that so I I give you a lot
 
02:27:18.650 --> 02:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
of credit for that
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing I want to speak to
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
was the fingerprint requirement that
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
happened so every year I go down at the
 
02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
end of the year to get when we have our
 
02:27:29.809 --> 02:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
week and I have to pick up the check uh
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
that comes to the law enforcement
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
memorial and I have to be fingerprinted
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
and I thought being in this field that
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
I'm in and have been in for three
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
decades would exempt me from that it
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
does not I have to get fingerprinted uh
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
and have my background check the one
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
thing I would and so when they when I
 
02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
saw in the bill that this was going to
 
02:27:47.929 --> 02:27:47.939 align:start position:0%
change it kind of made sense to me I do
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
share concerns brought out this morning
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
about you know are we concerned about
 
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.809 align:start position:0%
about you know are we concerned about
people

02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
um you know getting into trouble and I
 
02:27:56.929 --> 02:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
guess I would say this for you to
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
consider or ask you to consider this in
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement field when I signed
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
up to be a police officer some 32 years
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
ago I had my background done my
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
fingerprints were taken and my criminal
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
background was checked as I sit here 32
 
02:28:10.730 --> 02:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
years later it's never been done again
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the time when I go
 
02:28:14.750 --> 02:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
down to Boston Billiards to get my check
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
for my non-profit so we're allowing guys
 
02:28:20.090 --> 02:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
who carry guys and gals carry guns and
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
have the rights to take away people's
 
02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.610 align:start position:0%
have the rights to take away people's
rights

02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
frankly we're not requiring them to be
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
checked every year so I would think that
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
this would be safe to do in this field
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
is my opinion
 
02:28:34.849 --> 02:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about uh and I and I've
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
learned more today than I've ever known
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
about the HHR machines I'm the only
 
02:28:41.809 --> 02:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
concern in in Boston Billiards has moved
 
02:28:43.250 --> 02:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
to that and we've been told that we're
 
02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
going to be sharing a week with another
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
charity I don't have a problem with that
 
02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
the the money that we get certainly is
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
sufficient to run it to run our program
 
02:28:54.889 --> 02:28:54.899 align:start position:0%
I am concerned If This Were to open up
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide and we would dilute that
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity that the Charities would
 
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
then suffer so I am very much in favor
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
of limiting that I think that's
 
02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
important to consider when you're making
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and I don't most of everything else
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
that I had written down here has already
 
02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
been discussed so I don't want to take
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
up any more of your time but I would
 
02:29:19.309 --> 02:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you
 
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
to consider carefully as you're doing
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
from sitting back here watching it
 
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
listening to it that you support House
 
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 607 as we move forward thank you
 
02:29:29.929 --> 02:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative Platt are you aware if
 
02:29:34.969 --> 02:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
there's a central repository for
 
02:29:34.979 --> 02:29:36.290 align:start position:0%
there's a central repository for
fingerprints

02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
fingerprints
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
there is yes so those are main those are
 
02:29:40.610 --> 02:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
not thrown away they are maintained by
 
02:29:42.770 --> 02:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
the FBI so your prince would go to the
 
02:29:44.270 --> 02:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
FBI they would go through safety
 
02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
department of safety and then to the FBI
 
02:29:49.309 --> 02:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
for for analysis or checking follow up
 
02:29:49.319 --> 02:29:50.510 align:start position:0%
for for analysis or checking follow up
please

02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
if so why do we require fingerprinting
 
02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
at all if there are already fingerprints
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
on file well that that is that is my
 
02:30:00.530 --> 02:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
question I guess although not everyone
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
has I guess arguably not everyone in the
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
world has been fingerprinted
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you know unless they've they've been
 
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
required to under a certain but once
 
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
that occurs there's no value to redoing
 
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
that other than checking a background
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
checking a criminal record
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
I will say that anyone convicted of a
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or above crime doesn't do
 
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
that quietly it hits the newspapers and
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's not something that you can keep
 
02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:28.370 align:start position:0%
that's not something that you can keep
quiet

02:30:28.370 --> 02:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
quiet
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Britain so maybe it's in
 
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay Madam chair but maybe it's in the
 
02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
legislation but um regarding the benefit
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's paid to a non-profit yeah now
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
does a non-profit have to be in the
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
municipality that a gaming
 
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
building is or it does not no the
 
02:30:50.809 --> 02:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
requirements for a non-profit must be
 
02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
that you must be a non-profit in good
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
standing so you must be registered with
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
the state you must be registered with
 
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
charitable trust you have to produce and
 
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
you have to have the IRS standard or
 
02:31:02.450 --> 02:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
meet that standard and all of that
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork is required to be filed each
 
02:31:08.590 --> 02:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
year with the gaming
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
institution that's going to contribute
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
to you but there's not a requirement for
 
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
you to be in that area for instance law
 
02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement memorial is housed out of
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
Concord and and we receive generous
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
donations from Nashua from Boston
 
02:31:25.250 --> 02:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
Billiards to follow so follow up and
 
02:31:26.570 --> 02:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
then representative blood has a
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up so is it realistic to think
 
02:31:30.650 --> 02:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
that um myself who's an executive
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
director of uh transport Central
 
02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit in Plymouth might be able to
 
02:31:36.770 --> 02:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
apply for something like this yes I
 
02:31:38.450 --> 02:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
would say that it is yes the other thing
 
02:31:40.429 --> 02:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
I just want to add and maybe a lot of
 
02:31:41.929 --> 02:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
you know that I didn't have a very in
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I have very good feeling
 
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
about gambling casinos
 
02:31:48.170 --> 02:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
based on my training and experience I
 
02:31:49.849 --> 02:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
will tell you that opinion changed when
 
02:31:51.770 --> 02:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
I spent some time and I can only speak
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
to Boston Billiards and I'm not here to
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
promote Boston Billiards but it's the
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
one I'm familiar with I went in there
 
02:31:58.130 --> 02:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's a very professionally run
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
organization I watched the balance and
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
checks from a corner and it's and it's
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
run the way I would expect it to be run
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
and I left there much more confident
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
about gaming in the way New Hampshire
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
controls it than I ever had prior to
 
02:32:15.889 --> 02:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
that so just something for you to think
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
about thank you thank you
 
02:32:20.690 --> 02:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
just a statement I know firsthand that
 
02:32:22.730 --> 02:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
it used to be you have to be a 501c3
 
02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's changed so a 501c4 can now also
 
02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:33.050 align:start position:0%
that's changed so a 501c4 can now also
apply

02:32:33.050 --> 02:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
yes I know a 501c3 can I'm not familiar
 
02:32:40.910 --> 02:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
when we do the work session we can drill
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
down on that unless you would like to
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
fill out a pin card but we're going to
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
fall into a follow-up work session thank
 
02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony and we
 
02:32:52.969 --> 02:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
will make sure oh I'm sorry do we have a
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
question over here oh representative
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
already apologize yes sir just to switch
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
hats a second too yes sir you're a law
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in fish and games I
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
am yes sir now
 
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
just a little bit on background checks
 
02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:08.750 align:start position:0%
just a little bit on background checks
yes

02:33:08.750 --> 02:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:33:12.889 --> 02:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.889 --> 02:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
with a law enforcement agency yes do
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
they do the FBI check or do they just do
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
the state police check both of which are
 
02:33:23.090 --> 02:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
considered background checks right and
 
02:33:25.010 --> 02:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct and correct me if I'm
 
02:33:27.530 --> 02:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
wrong the state police check is only a
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
record not of arrests
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
but only of convictions that appear on
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
the state police Forum doesn't talk
 
02:33:36.290 --> 02:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
about arrest it doesn't talk about court
 
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
appearances it only talks about
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
convictions that so you're correct on a
 
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
couple of different levels so state law
 
02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies do a uh
 
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
mind-boggling background it's a complete
 
02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
background to include FBI records FBI
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
numbers if one exists we go back we my
 
02:33:56.210 --> 02:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
agency we go to the elementary school
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
where the officer attended school we
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
start there and work our way up so those
 
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
are pretty complete at the state level
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
and most most cities now I believe with
 
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
leeak with the implication of the liac
 
02:34:10.429 --> 02:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
commission most cities I think are now
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
doing that as well you would be correct
 
02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
a state if you were to run my background
 
02:34:17.450 --> 02:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire State Police or
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety you would find only
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
convictions that have occurred in the
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you would not
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
find for instance I just ran an
 
02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:26.710 align:start position:0%
find for instance I just ran an
individual

02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
who is going to be applying for a guides
 
02:34:31.250 --> 02:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire sure his record
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
was clear and we found his record was
 
02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not clear when we left the
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
state and went to other states called
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
the triple I investigation so you would
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
be accurate
 
02:34:41.399 --> 02:34:43.190 align:start position:0%
be accurate
follow-up

02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh this is for
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
information I believe
 
02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm also aware that private
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
investigators have both a FBI check yes
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the triple I check and they also check
 
02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
with the RCMP
 
02:35:00.050 --> 02:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
um because of the type of activities in
 
02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
which they're engaged sure and I believe
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of the youth activities also
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
require a multiple State Check Yes uh
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
because of the chance for child abuse
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
but the term background check as it
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise appears in law
 
02:35:19.490 --> 02:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
only applies to the Sur surface check
 
02:35:21.410 --> 02:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
that is done by the New Hampshire State
 
02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
Police is that more or less a correct
 
02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
analysis or New England yes yes that's a
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty good analysis yes that's
 
02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
a that's a very general term thank you
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%

we're an essential service we're a
 
02:36:07.370 --> 02:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of charitable gaming uh God
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
bless charitable gaming they have saved
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
us more than once uh the
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
um couple things I'll say briefly are
 
02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:19.490 align:start position:0%
um couple things I'll say briefly are
that

02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:22.250 --> 02:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
um the Crim criminal checks I've been in
 
02:36:24.170 --> 02:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
human services serving vulnerable
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
populations for more than 40 years I've
 
02:36:28.849 --> 02:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
had background checks I've had criminal
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
checks Galore
 
02:36:32.270 --> 02:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
first time I've been fingerprinted was
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
for charitable gaming and now I have to
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
do it every year so I'd love to not
 
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
doing it's it's a nightmare having to do
 
02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:39.590 align:start position:0%
doing it's it's a nightmare having to do
it

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and sharing of days because the uh
 
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming now has to be shared
 
02:36:49.849 --> 02:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
by two Charities our our
 
02:36:49.859 --> 02:36:50.809 align:start position:0%
by two Charities our our
um

02:36:50.809 --> 02:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:52.730 --> 02:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
benefits from Cheryl gaming have been
 
02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
reduced considerably so anything you can
 
02:36:57.849 --> 02:36:57.859 align:start position:0%
do to bolster charitable gaming is great
 
02:37:00.170 --> 02:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
raising the BET limit is wonderful
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
taking the bent limit away I don't know
 
02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
whatever you need to do to help
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming uh is a really great
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
thing and representative Ames you had
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
asked how the charitable gaming outfits
 
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
were doing and that was a really great
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
question I'm here to say how are the
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
Charities doing
 
02:37:17.939 --> 02:37:18.590 align:start position:0%
Charities doing
um

02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're struggling with inflation energy
 
02:37:24.889 --> 02:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
costs for me food costs Meals on Wheels
 
02:37:27.889 --> 02:37:27.899 align:start position:0%
I got to pay more for gas and food I've
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
got I raise a million dollars a year
 
02:37:31.969 --> 02:37:31.979 align:start position:0%
I've got to figure out how to raise a
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
million two next year because of the
 
02:37:37.969 --> 02:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
costs so whatever you can do to help
 
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
with charitable gaming it benefits our
 
02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
Charities it would be most appreciated
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
people might be getting hungry for lunch
 
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming I do not
 
02:37:57.170 --> 02:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
have any more pink cards is there anyone
 
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
else here who would like to say
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
something no okay we will now close the
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 607 and we
 
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
will schedule a work session which will
 
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
be noticed in the calendar for everyone
 
02:38:22.929 --> 02:38:22.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.849 --> 02:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
yeah we have until 1 15 so you have
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
about 40 minutes to take a lunch break
 
02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
and uh then please come back we all have
 
02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
Public public hearing starting at 1 15.
 
02:38:59.889 --> 02:38:59.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:19.190 --> 03:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Timothy Horgan from
 
03:29:23.210 --> 03:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 which uh
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
has no cigar shops in it although we're
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
right next to uh Dover which does have a
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
federal cigar shop
 
03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:30.830 align:start position:0%
federal cigar shop
um

03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:33.769 --> 03:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
actually probably most of you know this
 
03:29:38.090 --> 03:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
already but uh what is a premium cigar
 
03:29:40.370 --> 03:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm just say there's a more precise
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
definition but those are those pixie
 
03:29:43.370 --> 03:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
cars which are wrapped by hand in
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco leaves
 
03:29:47.690 --> 03:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
rather than uh wrapped by a machine and
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
paper they're much more expensive than
 
03:29:52.370 --> 03:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
cigarettes little cigars or regular
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
cigars and the previous cigars are not
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
taxed at all at the state level here in
 
03:29:59.330 --> 03:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they're subject only to a
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
minimal Federal excise tax of 40.26
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
cents per cigar for a product which
 
03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
typically sells for five or ten dollars
 
03:30:07.500 --> 03:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
typically sells for five or ten dollars
or

03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
even uh more than that sometimes much
 
03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
more than that so
 
03:30:14.210 --> 03:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does it eliminates the
 
03:30:18.290 --> 03:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
legal distincts in the rsas between
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
premium cigars and other cigars so it
 
03:30:22.490 --> 03:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
deletes the definition of Premium cigar
 
03:30:25.610 --> 03:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
from rsa78-1 the least two other
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
references in RSA 78 which was totally
 
03:30:30.590 --> 03:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
recodified in 2020 and actually one of
 
03:30:32.450 --> 03:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
the reasons this is a perennial bill but
 
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I haven't
 
03:30:35.630 --> 03:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
bother to do it in a couple of
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
legislative Seasons um
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
well aside from the fact that uh uh
 
03:30:42.050 --> 03:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
aside from the fact that so far it
 
03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone far but the committee is
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
certainly free to change his mind this
 
03:30:46.130 --> 03:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
time around
 
03:30:46.140 --> 03:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
time around
um also

03:30:47.389 --> 03:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
um also
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
um just in 20 and 21 things were kind of
 
03:30:52.190 --> 03:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
not really normal so this didn't seem
 
03:30:52.200 --> 03:30:52.969 align:start position:0%
not really normal so this didn't seem
like

03:30:52.969 --> 03:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:30:52.979 --> 03:30:54.710 align:start position:0%
like
this

03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:30:57.229 --> 03:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
seemed like just didn't seem like uh I
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
guess I wanted to limit the number of
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
bills I was introducing the amount of
 
03:31:01.130 --> 03:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
Burden they put in the legislative
 
03:31:02.690 --> 03:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
process but this year I went ahead and
 
03:31:04.729 --> 03:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
put it in and here I am again so the net
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
effect of that change
 
03:31:08.809 --> 03:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
has that changed the leading the
 
03:31:11.889 --> 03:31:11.899 align:start position:0%
specific uh definition of premium cigars
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
is that all uh it'll be taxed the same
 
03:31:17.809 --> 03:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
rate as all other cigars and 60 tobacco
 
03:31:20.929 --> 03:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
products a rate of 65.03 percent of the
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
wholesale price and that's 65 percent of
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price not the retail price
 
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
from I've seen premium cigars like most
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
other consumer goods are marked up about
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
100 when when retailed and uh
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
and then backing up a little bit the
 
03:31:37.190 --> 03:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
history tobacco rate tax rate changes
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
and little indicates that demand for
 
03:31:41.090 --> 03:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
tobacco is relatively price inelastic
 
03:31:42.410 --> 03:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
when the price goes up for whatever
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
reason demand goes down uh just a little
 
03:31:49.070 --> 03:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
so my opinion is HB 510 will lead to
 
03:31:49.080 --> 03:31:50.330 align:start position:0%
so my opinion is HB 510 will lead to
well

03:31:50.330 --> 03:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:31:53.389 --> 03:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
a lot more tax tobacco tax revenue or
 
03:31:55.849 --> 03:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
actually it's probably going to be in
 
03:31:57.530 --> 03:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
the order of about a million dollars so
 
03:31:58.729 --> 03:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
I guess we can debate whether or not
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money
 
03:32:00.120 --> 03:32:00.710 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money
um

03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
I love the little this less tobacco
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
consumption and those are both desirable
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
results and uh
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
I see a couple of the opponents of bills
 
03:32:10.490 --> 03:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
I remember the the last four hearings
 
03:32:12.530 --> 03:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
we've had on them and uh
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
and they claim it would drive to State
 
03:32:16.429 --> 03:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
cigar buyers out of business because the
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
cigarfishing nados are all supposedly
 
03:32:21.650 --> 03:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
all switched to buying cigars online
 
03:32:23.570 --> 03:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
but there are plenty of cigar bars and
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
cigar stores in other states which do
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
packs uh premium Cigars Cigars
 
03:32:31.490 --> 03:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
product appeals to the census Alicia
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
from Aficionado I'm kind of I mean I
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
don't mind smelling occasionally I'm not
 
03:32:39.050 --> 03:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
really in that category but you know you
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
can't feel taste or smell the cigars on
 
03:32:43.070 --> 03:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
the website or a catalog they're also
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
much more enjoyable when shared with
 
03:32:47.330 --> 03:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
other cigar aficionados I
 
03:32:50.330 --> 03:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
parenthetically I've noticed looking at
 
03:32:52.510 --> 03:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
the websites of various uh cigar
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
retailers in New Hampshire they all
 
03:32:57.050 --> 03:32:57.060 align:start position:0%
really a lot of them play up the uh
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
relation the idea that you can perform a
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
relationship with the staffs to talk
 
03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
about the personalities of the staffs
 
03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
even the people who make them um so you
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
know especially
 
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's a gentleman there's a gentleman
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
here who's going to come in and disagree
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
with everything I say but uh his his
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
website uh talks all about himself and
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
his employers and certainly uh I guess
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
if you like cigars they're probably fun
 
03:33:23.150 --> 03:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
people to buy cigars from so and it's a
 
03:33:25.849 --> 03:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
so it's a very social aspect to a cigar
 
03:33:27.650 --> 03:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
smoking and they're expensive and
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
unhealthy maybe not as unhealthy as
 
03:33:31.849 --> 03:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
cigarettes but they're still not good or
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
vaping but they're still not as good for
 
03:33:34.910 --> 03:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
you so
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion my take on it is that like
 
03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
yeah cigar fishing out of those they
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
avoid avoiding taxes and getting a good
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
bargain like everyone else but even the
 
03:33:45.170 --> 03:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
absence of a state line first of all if
 
03:33:46.729 --> 03:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
you're really bottom line oriented
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
person if not paying taxes if saving
 
03:33:49.849 --> 03:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
money is what you really care about
 
03:33:49.859 --> 03:33:50.750 align:start position:0%
money is what you really care about
that's

03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:33:52.729 --> 03:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
really not the product for you cigar
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
smoking is not really the bad habit the
 
03:33:56.450 --> 03:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
or the hobby whatever we want to call it
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
for you so it's a
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
and um so actually my opinion is
 
03:34:04.370 --> 03:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
probably my opinion is the market will
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
be relatively unaffected if we impose
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
attacks on them um whether or not
 
03:34:11.090 --> 03:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
specific language screen this tax
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
exemption was added to the rsas in 2009
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
the first year I was in the legislature
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
as part of the Budget Trailer Bill and
 
03:34:17.160 --> 03:34:18.769 align:start position:0%
as part of the Budget Trailer Bill and
frankly

03:34:18.769 --> 03:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure what the rationale
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
for the for the exemption was it may
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
just I think it's just one of those
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
things that gets put in during the
 
03:34:28.610 --> 03:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
budget process and
 
03:34:30.650 --> 03:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
we're not quite sure sometimes you're
 
03:34:31.969 --> 03:34:31.979 align:start position:0%
not quite sure where these things come
 
03:34:33.469 --> 03:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
from it does hearken back to the days
 
03:34:34.490 --> 03:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire was a major
 
03:34:36.769 --> 03:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of cigars one of the
 
03:34:38.269 --> 03:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
actually the biggest most famous cigar
 
03:34:40.550 --> 03:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
factories in the USA was the RG
 
03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:42.130 align:start position:0%
factories in the USA was the RG
Sullivan's

03:34:42.130 --> 03:34:42.140 align:start position:0%
Sullivan's
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
7-20-4 factory located in the heart of
 
03:34:46.969 --> 03:34:46.979 align:start position:0%
downtown Manchester the building is
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
still standing it still has the RG
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
Sullivan cigar sign on it um
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
that area ended
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
well at some point in the middle of the
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
last century probably like really almost
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
100 100 years ago so uh
 
03:35:01.010 --> 03:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
fire as you can tell there's no cigars
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
manufactured here in the in the uh New
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a fairly limited
 
03:35:08.330 --> 03:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
number of cigar bars and cigar stores
 
03:35:08.340 --> 03:35:09.950 align:start position:0%
number of cigar bars and cigar stores
um

03:35:09.950 --> 03:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's hard some of them are near the
 
03:35:13.969 --> 03:35:13.979 align:start position:0%
border but uh some of them are some
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
distance from the border and of course
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
the whole population of New Hampshire is
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
concentrated along the border with
 
03:35:19.490 --> 03:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think they're all
 
03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:20.990 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think they're all
located

03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
located
 
03:35:22.490 --> 03:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
just judging from where they're located
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
and so forth they're not just getting
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
people coming across from Massachusetts
 
03:35:31.010 --> 03:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
to flee the uh cigar tax down there and
 
03:35:33.050 --> 03:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
um as I said their cigar bars and cigar
 
03:35:35.330 --> 03:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts
 
03:35:35.340 --> 03:35:36.590 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts
um

03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:38.929 --> 03:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
and uh and actually I've supported some
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills which would make it easier for
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
garbars to do business like you know we
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
constantly there's very things like
 
03:35:46.490 --> 03:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's hookah bars which are licensed
 
03:35:49.010 --> 03:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
cigar bars which mostly sell uh
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
non-cigar products and we occasionally
 
03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
think about wet food and drink they can
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
sell so I'm not necessary this doesn't
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
affect any of those but I'm not
 
03:35:58.729 --> 03:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
necessarily against those businesses I
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
just think uh
 
03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
I just think these cigars should be
 
03:36:04.370 --> 03:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
taxed at the same rate of other tobacco
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
products and I'm uh obviously not
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to high tobacco taxes and um
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
so I'm confident so I'm confident the
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
cigar industry in New Hampshire will
 
03:36:17.210 --> 03:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll rebound from the imposition
 
03:36:19.849 --> 03:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
of this tax I'm frankly
 
03:36:21.650 --> 03:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
I mean it's frankly I'm not sure if
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
it'll make much difference at all to
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
most of the cigar smokers who are
 
03:36:27.650 --> 03:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
especially the ones who are coming in to
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
enjoy it and social social setting so
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh I certainly don't think
 
03:36:34.610 --> 03:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
everything is going to be driven online
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
um something that should Matt do is we
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
do have like several cigar retailers who
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
do a good online business so I don't
 
03:36:44.570 --> 03:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
think uh I don't think this bill would
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
it would have would affect that
 
03:36:47.279 --> 03:36:48.290 align:start position:0%
it would have would affect that
um

03:36:48.290 --> 03:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
that element of the industry to
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
adversely because at least in theory the
 
03:36:53.809 --> 03:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
buyers of the cars as I understand it
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
have to pay the tax in the state where
 
03:36:57.530 --> 03:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
the cigars are delivered to so they're
 
03:36:59.090 --> 03:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
not at least in theory they're not
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
avoiding these cigar tax and uh
 
03:37:04.370 --> 03:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
and you can certainly I mean you could
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
certainly I certainly view that as a
 
03:37:07.010 --> 03:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
friendly Amendment if you wanted to like
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
clarify that we're not taxing cigars
 
03:37:11.330 --> 03:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
that are shipped out of state but um so
 
03:37:13.309 --> 03:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
and I should also
 
03:37:13.319 --> 03:37:17.349 align:start position:0%
and I should also
foreign

03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
manufactured in New Hampshire but the
 
03:37:21.530 --> 03:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
two places I two companies I found who
 
03:37:23.450 --> 03:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
are manufacturing their own cigars both
 
03:37:25.370 --> 03:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
actually have their plants in Central
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
America one in Honduras and one in
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
Nicaragua so they're not uh they're not
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
producing the uh they're not producing
 
03:37:35.090 --> 03:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh the cigars here in New Hampshire
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
anyway and one
 
03:37:39.410 --> 03:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
one last digression here which is the
 
03:37:41.570 --> 03:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
Archie Sullivan company he was
 
03:37:44.330 --> 03:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh I think his name was Robert G
 
03:37:47.090 --> 03:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
Sullivan he was famous for making one of
 
03:37:49.010 --> 03:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
the best 10th Cent cigars which I think
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
when you account for inflation would put
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
those cigars back in the premium premium
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
Market but
 
03:37:56.750 --> 03:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my bill it's been
 
03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
around the block a few times and uh
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
maybe this time
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
maybe uh maybe this time it'll actually
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
pass and certainly I mean certainly if I
 
03:38:07.010 --> 03:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
didn't introduce it the chances were
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
being passed are zero so I would I guess
 
03:38:11.090 --> 03:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions looks
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
like there may be some representative
 
03:38:14.750 --> 03:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
Platt has a question yes thank you why
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
do you care is it the million dollars
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
you think it might raise or health
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
effects or what
 
03:38:22.250 --> 03:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
well it started out I was uh I was more
 
03:38:24.110 --> 03:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
interested in the e-cigarette and vaping
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
tax which those were also like not being
 
03:38:28.010 --> 03:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
taxed as the same rate of the tobacco
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
products that's luckily uh been kind of
 
03:38:30.239 --> 03:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
products that's luckily uh been kind of
a

03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
that that's been uh that's that's been a
 
03:38:37.849 --> 03:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a resolve but there's still this
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
thing with the cigars I'm not sure why
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
the cheap cigars should be taxed and
 
03:38:42.650 --> 03:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
then the expensive one should not be
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
taxed if anything it would make more
 
03:38:45.889 --> 03:38:45.899 align:start position:0%
sense to do it the other way around but
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's just uh
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
you know just and it's just it's just
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's not really enough to
 
03:38:55.010 --> 03:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
balance the budget Budget on but it just
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
seemed like uh it just seemed like a uh
 
03:38:59.690 --> 03:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
just seemed like a discrepancy like an
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
oddity in the law of that really served
 
03:39:03.410 --> 03:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
no discernible purpose at least no
 
03:39:04.969 --> 03:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
discernible purpose of anyone who's not
 
03:39:08.050 --> 03:39:08.060 align:start position:0%
in the premium cigar business so thanks
 
03:39:10.429 --> 03:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
03:39:13.010 --> 03:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh representative
 
03:39:13.020 --> 03:39:14.630 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh representative
Horrigan

03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
Horrigan
 
03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
um do you have a sense of what
 
03:39:20.450 --> 03:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
percentage of all tobacco sales uh is
 
03:39:22.849 --> 03:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
made up of premium cigars well it's
 
03:39:25.309 --> 03:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
fairly small it's addressed in the
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
the frisco note they have they've
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
captured some of the sales so they they
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
the state knows about all
 
03:39:33.769 --> 03:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
sales of premium cigars that are done
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
through wholesalers who also sell
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
alcohol and or taxable tobacco products
 
03:39:40.849 --> 03:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
which would that's what they call other
 
03:39:42.650 --> 03:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
tobacco products which I guess is mostly
 
03:39:44.210 --> 03:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
snuff and rolling tobacco and then
 
03:39:45.769 --> 03:39:45.779 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and also
 
03:39:47.690 --> 03:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
little cigars which are basically
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
cigarettes wrapped in brown paper that
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh with uh
 
03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
it was maybe like a more different
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco than you'd use in a cigarette so
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
they do capture those and uh the figures
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
there in your fiscal note and ever
 
03:40:04.030 --> 03:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
memorize the exact number but
 
03:40:07.010 --> 03:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
assuming this is the right bill it is
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
um so you know the wholesale value of
 
03:40:12.050 --> 03:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
premium cigars sold through license
 
03:40:13.849 --> 03:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
wholesalers once you sell other products
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
you need a license for is one million
 
03:40:15.540 --> 03:40:17.410 align:start position:0%
you need a license for is one million
487

03:40:17.410 --> 03:40:17.420 align:start position:0%
487
 
03:40:20.330 --> 03:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
549 and then there's some unknown amount
 
03:40:21.670 --> 03:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
which are
 
03:40:24.769 --> 03:40:24.779 align:start position:0%
wholesalers who deal only in premium
 
03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
cigars and I'm not uh
 
03:40:30.050 --> 03:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
at least some of the some of the tobacco
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
pretty much cigar retailers they've
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
looked and seem to also be selling other
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
products there and some aren't but so
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:40:39.950 --> 03:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
and if you if you if you do the math and
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
assume no effect whatsoever on demand
 
03:40:45.769 --> 03:40:45.779 align:start position:0%
they came up with a gain of 967 thousand
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm sure there'd be some
 
03:40:49.250 --> 03:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
reduction in demand but then there's
 
03:40:52.269 --> 03:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
also like all the uh
 
03:40:54.170 --> 03:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
non-licensed wholesalers you're selling
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
premium cigars that's where I figure
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's about a million dollars more you
 
03:40:57.479 --> 03:40:58.250 align:start position:0%
it's about a million dollars more you
know

03:40:58.250 --> 03:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
just doing a very rough pack of the
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
envelope calculation representative Almy
 
03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
03:41:07.610 --> 03:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you were you aware that on the
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
only reason that we know how much
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco gets sold cigarettes get sold in
 
03:41:17.690 --> 03:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
this state is because of the tobacco of
 
03:41:17.700 --> 03:41:20.570 align:start position:0%
this state is because of the tobacco of
settlement

03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
and that there is a requirement in the
 
03:41:26.929 --> 03:41:26.939 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement that the on
 
03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
the sellers
 
03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh send lists of who has bought from out
 
03:41:35.330 --> 03:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
of their state
 
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
to the state where they are buying
 
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
I was not not aware of it in the great
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
detail that you are but uh yes I'm I'm
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're right and I'm not
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
disputing and that does not include
 
03:41:48.359 --> 03:41:49.729 align:start position:0%
disputing and that does not include
cigars

03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
cigars
 
03:41:51.889 --> 03:41:51.899 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you yes in terms of
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for oh I apologize
 
03:42:01.490 --> 03:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
that you are representative orrs
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Madam
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:42:07.729 --> 03:42:07.739 align:start position:0%
question representative so I'm looking
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the health statistic you've provided
 
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
it seems to be very low risk product and
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at all the times you
 
03:42:17.570 --> 03:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
submitted the bill it looks like you've
 
03:42:19.190 --> 03:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
taken a pretty good butt whooping on
 
03:42:23.090 --> 03:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
that uh we just heard from the gaming
 
03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:24.170 align:start position:0%
that uh we just heard from the gaming
Commission

03:42:24.170 --> 03:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
that we are losing a lot of charitable
 
03:42:30.050 --> 03:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
money to Massachusetts because of the
 
03:42:32.750 --> 03:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
way we set fees and that kind of thing
 
03:42:35.150 --> 03:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
I mean it doesn't sound like you've done
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
your homework in terms of what was just
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative I'll stop you there this
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
is a question not questioning any
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
motives we're actually questioning the
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
factual stuff in the bill I'm such a
 
03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:48.349 align:start position:0%
factual stuff in the bill I'm such a
rookie

03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
rookie
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't we have we never
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
question motives or that kind of thing
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh but if you have a technical question
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
about the intent of the bill please ask
 
03:42:58.130 --> 03:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
that question thank you thank you guys
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna get there eventually I guess
 
03:43:02.330 --> 03:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
so I noticed that most of the cigar bars
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
or whatever they're called are along the
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
border so my concern is that we're going
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
to lose this business to Massachusetts
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
do you have you done any studies at all
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not we are I
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
mean you had an opinion yet but have you
 
03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
actually done any studies well the the
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
anecdote we heard and I think the
 
03:43:23.450 --> 03:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
gentleman I heard the anecdote from is
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
probably going to get up and testify
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
after me sort of his version of the
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
story is that there's one well-known
 
03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
story is that there's one well-known
cigar

03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
cigar
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
retailer and mail order retailer here
 
03:43:32.279 --> 03:43:33.229 align:start position:0%
retailer and mail order retailer here
who

03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:43:35.090 --> 03:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
um he'd been fighting with state of
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts over their tax and then he
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
picked up and moved the whole business
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and I guess actually
 
03:43:43.610 --> 03:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
turns out the locations he sold his
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
locations in Massachusetts and I don't
 
03:43:48.650 --> 03:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
see any evidence that they stopped
 
03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
operating as cigar buyers but uh I mean
 
03:43:53.450 --> 03:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
people there may be some I will say
 
03:43:53.460 --> 03:43:54.650 align:start position:0%
people there may be some I will say
we're

03:43:54.650 --> 03:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
and this is these are subjects for other
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
bills but uh we are way behind
 
03:44:00.170 --> 03:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well we're extremely
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
behind in cannabis we have no legal
 
03:44:03.469 --> 03:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis sales whatsoever in New
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whereas Massachusetts has a
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
thriving cannabis industry and um
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of gaming you know they're
 
03:44:11.450 --> 03:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
they're ahead of us too you know they
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
have uh they have that nice beautiful
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
new Wind Casino in Everett can we
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
refocus this conversation on premium
 
03:44:20.809 --> 03:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
cigars yeah exactly thank you
 
03:44:23.870 --> 03:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not too con I'm not too concerned
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
I mean uh I'm not sure if there's I
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure if there's much of a
 
03:44:29.210 --> 03:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
price War over the Border as people
 
03:44:31.969 --> 03:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
people think and uh okay I mean if they
 
03:44:33.950 --> 03:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
if they lower their if we raise them
 
03:44:35.330 --> 03:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
they lower their price there may be some
 
03:44:38.330 --> 03:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
effect but uh I don't haven't haven't
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
studied in the detail I mean what I
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
heard from the industry of course is
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
that if we put a tax in this the whole
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire-based industry will
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
evaporate and that's inconsistent with
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
what I've seen going on in Massachusetts
 
03:44:54.250 --> 03:44:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.170 --> 03:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay the chair will
 
03:45:00.170 --> 03:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
recognize Curtis Berry from
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
representing the cigar Association of
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:45:11.210 --> 03:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
um and good afternoon members of the
 
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh I'll apologize to those
 
03:45:15.170 --> 03:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that have been
 
03:45:16.429 --> 03:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
here for a while because this is
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
repetitive we've heard it all before as
 
03:45:20.830 --> 03:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan mentioned
 
03:45:23.690 --> 03:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative I will address your
 
03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
question as part of my testimony and I
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
think the response that was anticipated
 
03:45:29.809 --> 03:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor is going to be quite
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
different than than what we have uh to
 
03:45:35.330 --> 03:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
give as an example in reality
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
um first of all I want to address the
 
03:45:40.969 --> 03:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
cigar bar issue just to set the stage
 
03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
and and explain or remind about how the
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
statute Works relative to cigar bars
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
um many of the cigar retailers do not
 
03:45:53.090 --> 03:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
have also a cigar bar license some of
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
them do among our group there are
 
03:45:57.530 --> 03:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
probably I think five Cigar Bar licenses
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the 13 or 14 or so maybe more now
 
03:46:03.530 --> 03:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
locations that I'm here on behalf of
 
03:46:07.130 --> 03:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
but the statute requires 60 percent of
 
03:46:09.410 --> 03:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
your Revenue to come from the sales of
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
cigars and cigar related products
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
which means if you don't have the cigar
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
store the cigar bar goes away by Statute
 
03:46:19.490 --> 03:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
full stop
 
03:46:19.500 --> 03:46:20.269 align:start position:0%
full stop
um

03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:22.729 --> 03:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
so to the bill directly
 
03:46:25.190 --> 03:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
um in in I'll apologize again uh
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative almi reminded me I left
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
you a packet but I did not put my
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
business card attached to the packet it
 
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
was paper clipped in in the top sheet
 
03:46:36.530 --> 03:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
looked like this it is a copy of the
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
statute so what you don't see in the
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced is very pertinent
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
this is how the statute defines premium
 
03:46:44.760 --> 03:46:45.769 align:start position:0%
this is how the statute defines premium
cigar

03:46:45.769 --> 03:46:45.779 align:start position:0%
cigar
 
03:46:47.809 --> 03:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
and one piece that I'll draw your
 
03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
attention to is
 
03:46:50.279 --> 03:46:51.469 align:start position:0%
attention to is
um

03:46:51.469 --> 03:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
the first one is made entirely by hand
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
of all natural tobacco leaf
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
so it's not like other tobacco products
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
where there are flavorings chemicals Etc
 
03:47:06.170 --> 03:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
this is 100 leaf tobacco no stems or
 
03:47:06.180 --> 03:47:07.670 align:start position:0%
this is 100 leaf tobacco no stems or
anything

03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:09.170 align:start position:0%
anything
um

03:47:09.170 --> 03:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's important for context now there
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
are three states New Hampshire being one
 
03:47:15.410 --> 03:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
of them that does not tax what is
 
03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
defined as premium cigars the other two
 
03:47:18.290 --> 03:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
of Florida
 
03:47:22.370 --> 03:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
and Pennsylvania those two states have a
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
very heavy presence of cigar
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers there so their influence
 
03:47:29.929 --> 03:47:29.939 align:start position:0%
is felt but New Hampshire also has
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
created an industry that sells premium
 
03:47:33.359 --> 03:47:34.910 align:start position:0%
created an industry that sells premium
cigars

03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
cigars
 
03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
um in on the next page in in the packet
 
03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
which was the map that was referred to
 
03:47:42.190 --> 03:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
earlier there are a number of locations
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
with stores that are affiliated with our
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
organization and as you can see many of
 
03:47:49.849 --> 03:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
them are along the southern border or
 
03:47:53.929 --> 03:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
along I-93 that is not by accident
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the sales of premium cigars I imagine
 
03:48:00.050 --> 03:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
much like the per capita beer sales in
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
the state are not to New Hampshire's
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
residents because New Hampshire
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
residents are
 
03:48:09.050 --> 03:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
smoke cigars heavier than the rest of
 
03:48:10.729 --> 03:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
03:48:13.490 --> 03:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
a premium cigar if stored correctly will
 
03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
last a very long time which means the
 
03:48:17.769 --> 03:48:17.779 align:start position:0%
ability to sell to out-of-state
 
03:48:20.030 --> 03:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
customers who come here occasionally
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
they can load up put it in a humidor
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
store it and enjoy it later on
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
so what you see is by Design
 
03:48:27.720 --> 03:48:29.809 align:start position:0%
so what you see is by Design
now

03:48:29.809 --> 03:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
um one thing about the association I'd
 
03:48:32.929 --> 03:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
like you to keep in mind relative to
 
03:48:35.330 --> 03:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
these locations is we
 
03:48:38.330 --> 03:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
estimate over a hundred employees total
 
03:48:42.050 --> 03:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
among these these retailers so it's a a
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
small but important part of the economy
 
03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:46.490 align:start position:0%
small but important part of the economy
um

03:48:46.490 --> 03:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
the speculation or the assertion that
 
03:48:52.190 --> 03:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
stores will not close if you pass the
 
03:48:56.090 --> 03:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
tax is refuted by an actual example and
 
03:48:58.370 --> 03:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
the truth is Mr Dave Garofalo with me
 
03:48:58.380 --> 03:48:59.150 align:start position:0%
the truth is Mr Dave Garofalo with me
today

03:48:59.150 --> 03:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh owns three locations Seabrook Nashua
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
and Salem
 
03:49:06.969 --> 03:49:06.979 align:start position:0%
uh had several stores in Massachusetts
 
03:49:10.130 --> 03:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
before in the mid 90s and he did fight
 
03:49:12.290 --> 03:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
the tax down there that is true and when
 
03:49:14.330 --> 03:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts decided to
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
tax premium cigars he closed up shop and
 
03:49:19.429 --> 03:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire and the truth is
 
03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
that at that time before the tax there
 
03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
were 30 some odd cigar stores in the
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
Greater Boston area today
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
one store
 
03:49:34.729 --> 03:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
that is an actual result of their tax
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
so what happens when you pass the tax in
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
a the vast majority of sales come from
 
03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
out of state residents B those residents
 
03:49:46.130 --> 03:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
have access to Cigars over the Internet
 
03:49:49.130 --> 03:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
also mentioned by the sponsor so if
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
you're paying the tax the cost is the
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
same are you going to enjoy the
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
convenience of the internet or continue
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
to buy in New Hampshire we assert the
 
03:50:01.490 --> 03:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
same result will happen in New Hampshire
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
the stores will close
 
03:50:05.929 --> 03:50:05.939 align:start position:0%
the cigar bars will close you will not
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
get the alcohol sales from cigar bars
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
you will not get the business taxes the
 
03:50:12.050 --> 03:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
state receives from the stores that will
 
03:50:14.510 --> 03:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
close that the state enjoys now to
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
whatever extent it is that is not
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
speculation that's the experience and
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
what the cigar store owners tell me will
 
03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
be the result
 
03:50:24.060 --> 03:50:25.070 align:start position:0%
be the result
um

03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
it's also already been referenced but
 
03:50:29.090 --> 03:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
the third document that I've given you
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
is a series of data points on cigar
 
03:50:38.210 --> 03:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
smoking and this comes from as the the
 
03:50:40.190 --> 03:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
notes indicate National Institutes of
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
Health FDA this is not the cigar
 
03:50:46.010 --> 03:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
industry one important piece that I know
 
03:50:48.650 --> 03:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
is important to some on the committee on
 
03:50:51.530 --> 03:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
the left column uh indicated by a little
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
birthday cake icon the average age of an
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
individual's first premium cigar is 30
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
years old
 
03:51:00.410 --> 03:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
compared to younger age for cigarettes
 
03:51:03.950 --> 03:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about youth access
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
the last page again already been
 
03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
referred to as I wanted to provide you
 
03:51:10.729 --> 03:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
with the legislative history for this
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
section of the tobacco tax statute
 
03:51:16.250 --> 03:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and again I was going to point out
 
03:51:17.450 --> 03:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
but it's already been pointed out
 
03:51:19.190 --> 03:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
several times the committee has seen
 
03:51:22.610 --> 03:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
this provision before and I certainly
 
03:51:25.130 --> 03:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
hope that the committee's committee sees
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
fit to dispose of this bill as previous
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislatures have
 
03:51:30.600 --> 03:51:31.429 align:start position:0%
legislatures have
um

03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:34.090 --> 03:51:34.100 align:start position:0%
on the note on the fiscal note
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's awful hard awfully hard to
 
03:51:36.720 --> 03:51:38.090 align:start position:0%
it's awful hard awfully hard to
determine

03:51:38.090 --> 03:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
um because we may not know all of the
 
03:51:41.389 --> 03:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
sales and
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that dra can
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
score a fiscal note if you will
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
dynamically in other words they don't
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
anticipate what percentage of the New
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sales go away we believe there
 
03:51:57.530 --> 03:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
will be virtually no Revenue increase if
 
03:52:00.290 --> 03:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed because the sales in
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
large part will go away
 
03:52:02.880 --> 03:52:04.309 align:start position:0%
large part will go away
um

03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:04.319 --> 03:52:05.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:08.210 --> 03:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
I'll close with
 
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
um an analogy if you will
 
03:52:13.370 --> 03:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
um because it's been raised about taxing
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
the other tobacco products
 
03:52:18.170 --> 03:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
the way I look at it is calling a
 
03:52:21.170 --> 03:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
premium cigar the same as a cigarette
 
03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:52:24.889 --> 03:52:24.899 align:start position:0%
would be the same as calling the filet
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
mignon the same as a hot dog
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 100 percent leaf
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
tobacco we're talking about 100 beef
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
versus the other two which have many
 
03:52:35.450 --> 03:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
other ingredients
 
03:52:37.690 --> 03:52:37.700 align:start position:0%
in a completely different product
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
so we don't think there's additional
 
03:52:41.570 --> 03:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
Revenue you'll lose the revenue that
 
03:52:43.010 --> 03:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
you're getting from the existing
 
03:52:43.020 --> 03:52:44.150 align:start position:0%
you're getting from the existing
businesses

03:52:44.150 --> 03:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
the science backs up our position uh so
 
03:52:50.090 --> 03:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
we don't see any compelling reason to uh
 
03:52:52.010 --> 03:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill we see a lot of reasons
 
03:52:54.050 --> 03:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
to keep the statute the way it is
 
03:52:55.969 --> 03:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
myself and Mr Garofalo happy to answer
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question
 
03:53:04.490 --> 03:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I actually lived in a cigar producing
 
03:53:13.969 --> 03:53:13.979 align:start position:0%
very small very poor town in Brazil
 
03:53:19.090 --> 03:53:19.100 align:start position:0%
the Cuban expatriates had created it
 
03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
hand wrapped is not something you're
 
03:53:24.050 --> 03:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to be able to produce economically
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the United States
 
03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:28.130 align:start position:0%
in the United States
uh

03:53:28.130 --> 03:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:31.849 --> 03:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
so these are all imported and could you
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
tell me I believe that there are huge
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
numbers of small tobacco grower Growers
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
still producing cigars around the world
 
03:53:43.190 --> 03:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
and sending them to the United States
 
03:53:44.929 --> 03:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
among other places
 
03:53:46.670 --> 03:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if it's okay I'd like to
 
03:53:51.050 --> 03:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
defer to one of the foremost cigar uh
 
03:53:52.849 --> 03:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
most knowledgeable people about cigars
 
03:53:55.190 --> 03:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
that I've ever met Mr Garofalo if that's
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
um because there does seem to be a
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
03:54:03.050 --> 03:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
um finding the Distributors that are
 
03:54:05.090 --> 03:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
going to be paying the tax if they were
 
03:54:05.100 --> 03:54:06.469 align:start position:0%
going to be paying the tax if they were
taxed

03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that part I couldn't speak to I
 
03:54:10.010 --> 03:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't think either one of us could that
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it would rely you to rely upon dra
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
for for their insight
 
03:54:18.530 --> 03:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
and and by the way there are two
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
companies based in New Hampshire
 
03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that are cigar manufacturers
 
03:54:24.050 --> 03:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
obviously don't actually produce them
 
03:54:24.060 --> 03:54:25.309 align:start position:0%
obviously don't actually produce them
here

03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:54:28.250 --> 03:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
um Kurt Kendall with twins uh smoke shop
 
03:54:31.550 --> 03:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
has resurrected that 724 brand which we
 
03:54:34.370 --> 03:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
see on the building in Manchester at one
 
03:54:36.410 --> 03:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
time the world's largest manufacturer of
 
03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
cigars and there's another New Hampshire
 
03:54:41.570 --> 03:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
native uh who has created a company
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
who's a former executive for a
 
03:54:43.920 --> 03:54:45.349 align:start position:0%
who's a former executive for a
manufacturer

03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
03:54:47.809 --> 03:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
um retired from the the large company
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
and created a company he calls Dunbarton
 
03:54:53.650 --> 03:54:53.660 align:start position:0%
tobacco and Trust he lives in Dunbarton
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
and sells Nationwide as well produces
 
03:54:58.729 --> 03:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but a fairly successful
 
03:55:01.809 --> 03:55:01.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
03:55:05.689 --> 03:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:55:08.030 --> 03:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think the
 
03:55:11.210 --> 03:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
information you have on on uh
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
it is very good I appreciate the
 
03:55:17.090 --> 03:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
statistics uh one and maybe it's in here
 
03:55:19.010 --> 03:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
somewhere but if you were to draw a
 
03:55:21.769 --> 03:55:21.779 align:start position:0%
trend line of cigar usage per capita
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 25 years what would
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
that trend line look like up down
 
03:55:28.250 --> 03:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
sideways per capita usage however you
 
03:55:29.929 --> 03:55:29.939 align:start position:0%
measure it it's just a point of
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
information for me sure that's all
 
03:55:33.710 --> 03:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
understood it may I defer that one as
 
03:55:33.720 --> 03:55:34.849 align:start position:0%
understood it may I defer that one as
well

03:55:34.849 --> 03:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely Mr Garofalo if you share to
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
join us um and then we just need you to
 
03:55:41.210 --> 03:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card Curtis you can show
 
03:55:42.530 --> 03:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
them how to do that that'd be great
 
03:55:42.540 --> 03:55:45.710 align:start position:0%
them how to do that that'd be great
welcome

03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.170 --> 03:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
um I'd say the past 20 years have been
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
pretty flat
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
um as far as sales were there was a boom
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
in the early 1990s
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
um that boosted it up a little bit and
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
since then it's been pretty flat for uh
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
other questions Representatives ORS
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question so are either of you
 
03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
aware that cigars are still hand rolled
 
03:56:19.130 --> 03:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
in Saint Augustine Florida because I've
 
03:56:20.870 --> 03:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
been there and I'm wondering if you knew
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
that yes yeah uh Tampa is is a place
 
03:56:27.530 --> 03:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
where cigars are still rolled um JC
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
Newman cigar Factory the last major size
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
Factory that's there little places for
 
03:56:38.150 --> 03:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
um you know show basically with Taurus
 
03:56:40.370 --> 03:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
or something would see it but for for me
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
for a major consumption uh Tampa seems
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
to be the last place left as far as
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
growing tobacco uh the Connecticut River
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
Valley including Massachusetts
 
03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:50.830 align:start position:0%
Valley including Massachusetts
Pennsylvania

03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
03:56:53.570 --> 03:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
Connecticut obviously
 
03:56:57.170 --> 03:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
um is is a bed of uh growing and now uh
 
03:56:59.090 --> 03:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
Florida actually brought it back after
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
150 years uh the growing tobacco down in
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
Florida now too we're talking uh tobacco
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
for cigars which is a actually a
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
different product than a tobacco for
 
03:57:13.490 --> 03:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
anything else including cigarettes
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:17.689 --> 03:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
hi if you know
 
03:57:25.010 --> 03:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
what is the rule for online taxation by
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
other states
 
03:57:29.469 --> 03:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
of uh cigars
 
03:57:34.849 --> 03:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
the tax is for the state that
 
03:57:34.859 --> 03:57:35.750 align:start position:0%
the tax is for the state that
um

03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
it collects it as the the products being
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
sold so this States take Massachusetts
 
03:57:44.090 --> 03:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
for instance the man that's still
 
03:57:47.809 --> 03:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
surviving when I left Massachusetts uh
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
is L.J Peretti in Boston he's still
 
03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
there there were 30 of us when I left
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
he's the last one that's standing uh the
 
03:57:58.910 --> 03:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
bulk of his business is why he's even
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
surviving the one person that's
 
03:58:02.750 --> 03:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
surviving is the bulk of his business is
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
sold online
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
and he sells that in a tax state which
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
is a 40 tax state uh but when he sells
 
03:58:12.830 --> 03:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
it online it's zero tax
 
03:58:16.189 --> 03:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
so the majority of consumers as Curtis
 
03:58:16.199 --> 03:58:17.269 align:start position:0%
so the majority of consumers as Curtis
said

03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:58:19.250 --> 03:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
um if there is tax within the state
 
03:58:21.290 --> 03:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
they'll choose to buy it in another
 
03:58:21.300 --> 03:58:22.910 align:start position:0%
they'll choose to buy it in another
state

03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:58:22.920 --> 03:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
state
um

03:58:23.510 --> 03:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
and um you know they'll uh not have to
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
pay the tax as as it would be
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
um there's uh by the way if if this tax
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
was to happen this would go from one of
 
03:58:40.630 --> 03:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
three lowest tax states to the highest
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
the the number one highest right now is
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
New York it's 75 percent this would be
 
03:58:48.530 --> 03:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
number two uh in all the United States
 
03:58:52.010 --> 03:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the highest tax I left Massachusetts
 
03:58:55.790 --> 03:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
at 12 tax it was enough that would bury
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
me because the the margins are not there
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
like he said the margins can be maybe 30
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
percent when it comes to selling a box
 
03:59:08.389 --> 03:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
of cigars and at 12 disadvantage of that
 
03:59:10.929 --> 03:59:10.939 align:start position:0%
and adding sales tax again Massachusetts
 
03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
compounding federal tax with State Tax
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
with sales tax uh I knew I wasn't going
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to survive and I left and I
 
03:59:21.530 --> 03:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
was basically laughed at for leaving
 
03:59:24.530 --> 03:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
because I was probably the number one
 
03:59:26.650 --> 03:59:26.660 align:start position:0%
guy in Boston at the time when I left
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
but I knew that I would not be able to
 
03:59:31.849 --> 03:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
survive and nor would these people that
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
were other retailers that said we'll be
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
okay they're all gone
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and the same thing will happen in New
 
03:59:39.000 --> 03:59:39.969 align:start position:0%
and the same thing will happen in New
Hampshire

03:59:39.969 --> 03:59:39.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
that will be gone and you know possibly
 
03:59:45.410 --> 03:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
going to one of those other states and
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
selling within the state of New
 
03:59:49.370 --> 03:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which there was no online
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
sales when I left in 1995. now it's a
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
whole different game that you know just
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
goes somewhere else and just sell into
 
03:59:58.490 --> 03:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
the state Mass New Hampshire will get
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
none of the tax uh money because it
 
04:00:03.349 --> 04:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
won't add up to anything that will go in
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
and also there'll be a hundred people
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
plus lose their job in the businesses
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
will go away there is no upsell to it uh
 
04:00:14.450 --> 04:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
because of the way tax goes from state
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
to state when it comes to Tobacco just
 
04:00:20.090 --> 04:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
to clarify follow-up yep I'm sorry
 
04:00:24.250 --> 04:00:24.260 align:start position:0%
um just to be sure I understand so the
 
04:00:26.929 --> 04:00:26.939 align:start position:0%
the business that remains in
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if it's
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
sells into Mass to a consumer or a place
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts it's it's Massachusetts
 
04:00:40.370 --> 04:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
tax right if if they sell out of
 
04:00:40.380 --> 04:00:41.650 align:start position:0%
tax right if if they sell out of
Massachusetts

04:00:41.650 --> 04:00:41.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
zero tax they'll collect nothing
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
out of state right out of state to uh
 
04:00:50.090 --> 04:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if the tax happen here in
 
04:00:51.769 --> 04:00:51.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I could sell to
 
04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and give no tax to New
 
04:00:56.090 --> 04:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right right no I think I
 
04:00:58.849 --> 04:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
understood okay representative
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
my question good answer with that last
 
04:01:00.540 --> 04:01:03.889 align:start position:0%
my question good answer with that last
Exchange

04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.130 --> 04:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative elberger yes
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you both
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions I'm looking at
 
04:01:14.570 --> 04:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
the fact sheet that you gave us and it
 
04:01:17.450 --> 04:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
points out as you mentioned that the uh
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
typical age for a cigar a premium cigar
 
04:01:23.809 --> 04:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
smoker is higher than for cigarettes and
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
you also point out that
 
04:01:26.640 --> 04:01:27.950 align:start position:0%
you also point out that
um

04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:31.150 --> 04:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
the typical premium scar smoker is
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
better educated perhaps than the general
 
04:01:34.739 --> 04:01:37.010 align:start position:0%
better educated perhaps than the general
population

04:01:37.010 --> 04:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:01:39.849 --> 04:01:39.859 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if we can infer from that
 
04:01:43.010 --> 04:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
that the typical premium cigar smoker
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
also has more disposable income
 
04:01:45.720 --> 04:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
also has more disposable income
then

04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.849 --> 04:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
I guess my sense is to respond it's a
 
04:01:52.859 --> 04:01:53.990 align:start position:0%
I guess my sense is to respond it's a
fair

04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
fair
 
04:01:54.000 --> 04:01:55.910 align:start position:0%
fair
inference

04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
inference
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
um because it's true as representative
 
04:02:00.769 --> 04:02:00.779 align:start position:0%
Horrigan said premium cigars are not
 
04:02:03.530 --> 04:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
inexpensive so
 
04:02:06.410 --> 04:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
that said you know if somebody I think
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
you'll find and these folks will tell
 
04:02:08.100 --> 04:02:08.750 align:start position:0%
you'll find and these folks will tell
you

04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
um that cigar premium cigar smoking is
 
04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
very seasonal another demonstration that
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's not addictive people will smoke
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
more often when they're Outdoors to
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
mowing the lawn they're on the boat
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
playing on the golf course
 
04:02:23.809 --> 04:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
um so you know cigar smoking can be
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
occasional as well
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so there may be some folks that are
 
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
just a few times a year and there are
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
going to be some folks that are weekly
 
04:02:35.330 --> 04:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.370 --> 04:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:02:40.610 --> 04:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that hot dogs and filet
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
mignon are
 
04:02:42.359 --> 04:02:43.969 align:start position:0%
mignon are
beef

04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
beef
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.720 --> 04:02:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
um they're not the same product but
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're still taxed at the same rate if
 
04:02:59.450 --> 04:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
you go to a restaurant and buy a hot dog
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
and you buy filet mignon your text the
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
same rate correct they are observation
 
04:03:06.769 --> 04:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair

Garofalo
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm curious without putting any
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
numbers on it what taxes does your
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%

business activities in the state of New
Hampshire

04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh knock on wood I've been doing this
 
04:03:32.090 --> 04:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
for 38 years I started in the cigar
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
business uh 38 years ago 1985 we paid
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
business profits to I don't know what
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers are but we're successful and
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
um we are one of the largest cigar
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
retailers in the world not just the
 
04:03:50.090 --> 04:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
United States in the world uh thank you
 
04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire for the New Hampshire
 
04:03:54.290 --> 04:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
Advantage which certainly did that I was
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
a a good retailer in Massachusetts
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
and then as taxes around us happen
 
04:04:04.729 --> 04:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
um I became one of the top retailers in
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
the world so uh this is certainly profit
 
04:04:10.969 --> 04:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
I pay what I'm supposed to pay whatever
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
that number is and if I knew it off the
 
04:04:14.809 --> 04:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
top of my head I would be happy to share
 
04:04:17.450 --> 04:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
it to you proudly share it with you it's
 
04:04:19.969 --> 04:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
successful we're certainly not taking a
 
04:04:22.429 --> 04:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
loss even through covid
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I I was not able to show a
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
quarter the that we didn't make profit
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
on so I couldn't collect because we made
 
04:04:35.450 --> 04:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
profit all the time and as Curtis said
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
um it is a product of convenience of
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
when you have time to enjoy it our
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
business drops
 
04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
um probably about 80 percent in the
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
winter months so January February March
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
not not very good at all and and there I
 
04:04:54.290 --> 04:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
would show you that no we're not very
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
profitable at all we may actually have a
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
loss when the weather gets good uh
 
04:05:01.010 --> 04:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
business gets really good during covid
 
04:05:03.650 --> 04:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
people had time to enjoy cigars in our
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
business actually took a bump up all of
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
a sudden where uh in most cases a lot of
 
04:05:11.150 --> 04:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
places were hurting in business and we
 
04:05:13.130 --> 04:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
ended up doing very well because people
 
04:05:15.050 --> 04:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
had time for it when people went back to
 
04:05:18.050 --> 04:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
work we do have a non-addictive product
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
the nicotine level and the cigar is
 
04:05:22.250 --> 04:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
between one and three percent when you
 
04:05:25.969 --> 04:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
take other Tibet other products period a
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
tomato is five percent nicotine eggplant
 
04:05:31.010 --> 04:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
is eight percent nicotine a cigar is one
 
04:05:33.170 --> 04:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
to three percent nicotine it's very very
 
04:05:36.170 --> 04:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
small it goes to a process to actually
 
04:05:38.090 --> 04:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
delete that to happen it's just a
 
04:05:41.090 --> 04:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
natural byproduct of a Nightshade grown
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
product which is a tomato an eggplant
 
04:05:45.769 --> 04:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
and uh there's a little bit in it but
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
not enough to make people want to smoke
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
outdoors in the cold not want to do it
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
when they're not comfortable to to do it
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
when price has an issue to it they just
 
04:05:58.729 --> 04:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
stop you know we're looking at the
 
04:06:00.290 --> 04:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
economy right now as the Slowdown
 
04:06:00.300 --> 04:06:01.309 align:start position:0%
economy right now as the Slowdown
happens

04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
happens
 
04:06:04.849 --> 04:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
it happened in 2007 and we were the
 
04:06:06.769 --> 04:06:06.779 align:start position:0%
first to see the Slowdown happen because
 
04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
nobody needs my product
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
and the more you make it difficult to
 
04:06:14.450 --> 04:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
people to uh obtain it or pay extra for
 
04:06:18.410 --> 04:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
it they check out so I I feel like the
 
04:06:21.769 --> 04:06:21.779 align:start position:0%
taxation I know the taxation uh ended up
 
04:06:24.170 --> 04:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
hurting uh friends below us here in
 
04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh if I may yeah follow up
 
04:06:29.929 --> 04:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
so that I think that was very uh
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
interesting answer in addition to the
 
04:06:34.370 --> 04:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
business profits tax does your business
 
04:06:37.610 --> 04:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
pay a variety of other taxes
 
04:06:39.889 --> 04:06:39.899 align:start position:0%
if every every tax we're supposed to pay
 
04:06:42.130 --> 04:06:42.140 align:start position:0%
meals and rum business Enterprise
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely liquor
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
well indirectly Through The Gruffalo
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
does not have a cigar bar license in any
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
of his does not have an operating cigar
 
04:06:53.150 --> 04:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
bar at any of his three uh locations
 
04:06:55.490 --> 04:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay so you're just a retail sales
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
operation not one of the cigar bars
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you representative
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
Plitt I just wanted to thank you I'm
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.689 --> 04:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and stay away from
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
me rep plot uh so thank you for taking
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
my question so you're telling us that
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
you can kind of see which way the
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
economy is going
 
04:07:23.210 --> 04:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
by your cigar sale so where is the
 
04:07:26.929 --> 04:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
economy going in 2023 yes I absolutely
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
can and and when that happened in 2007 a
 
04:07:30.889 --> 04:07:30.899 align:start position:0%
lot of people thought that happened in
 
04:07:34.010 --> 04:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
2008 and I I was a barometer for the
 
04:07:35.570 --> 04:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
first thing that would somebody would
 
04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
give up and it became literally lighting
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
a ten dollar bill on fire uh is the
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
business that I'm in and I saw it first
 
04:07:46.250 --> 04:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
and said oh here's what's happening and
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
then friends and other businesses would
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
see it like restaurants would see it
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
next uh entertainment would see it as it
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
as it went down here we are in a bad
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
first quarter of the Year anyway but
 
04:08:01.010 --> 04:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
business is down q1 to q1 last year so
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'd say the economy is is affecting us
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
as we see it now
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we had a question over
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
here representative leapley did I miss
 
04:08:13.010 --> 04:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
you yes I did have a question thank you
 
04:08:14.689 --> 04:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
has been very interesting
 
04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
has been very interesting
um

04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:21.050 --> 04:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
my question is because it it does when
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
you read the bill it's weird that
 
04:08:25.370 --> 04:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
premium cigars are this special thing
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
that is exempt from this tax and it it
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
is kind of a like playing field fairness
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
question for me I'm wondering if there
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
is a tax amount that would seem fair to
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
you so I'll tell you how this this began
 
04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
um and um it was brought up that there's
 
04:08:43.739 --> 04:08:45.050 align:start position:0%
um and um it was brought up that there's
some

04:08:45.050 --> 04:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
cigars to call themselves cigars little
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
cigars and really what they are is
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
cigarettes wrapped in brown paper and
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
they call themselves cigars and they
 
04:08:56.929 --> 04:08:56.939 align:start position:0%
were never cigars and they did that
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
because there was an exemption on all
 
04:09:01.969 --> 04:09:01.979 align:start position:0%
cigars as taxed differently so because
 
04:09:05.090 --> 04:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
these people did this we now had to
 
04:09:07.969 --> 04:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
separate what a cigar is that is not a
 
04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
today to this day it's called a little
 
04:09:11.809 --> 04:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
cigar it's a cigarette with brown paper
 
04:09:14.090 --> 04:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
instead of white paper and then it
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
became the next category would end up
 
04:09:17.689 --> 04:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
doing a thing called something else a
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
cigar the same thing happened with pipe
 
04:09:22.429 --> 04:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
tobacco pipe tobacco within the state is
 
04:09:25.370 --> 04:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
actually very very high tax you collect
 
04:09:28.189 --> 04:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
nothing on it because it's so used so
 
04:09:29.929 --> 04:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
little but it was the cigarette
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
companies that used roll your own
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and started calling it pipe
 
04:09:36.050 --> 04:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
tobacco and then the government came in
 
04:09:37.610 --> 04:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
and said I see what you're doing now
 
04:09:40.929 --> 04:09:40.939 align:start position:0%
we're going to tax pipe tobacco at 68
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
and then nobody buys pipe tobacco in the
 
04:09:45.530 --> 04:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire nobody
 
04:09:48.050 --> 04:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's if you figure out the money
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
that it adds up to it adds up to nothing
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
because they buy it all online I used to
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
sell an awful lot of pipe tobacco but at
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
68 I don't sell to pipe tobacco anymore
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
not only do it does it add up to
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
anything I don't even carry it anymore
 
04:10:03.410 --> 04:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
because nobody will buy it
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
if you tax cigars at 68 I will not
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
operate in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:10:13.330 --> 04:10:13.340 align:start position:0%
period I left at 15 12. I left at 12
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
it just will not end up happening
 
04:10:17.809 --> 04:10:17.819 align:start position:0%
because we have the opportunity my
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
customers have the opportunity to buy it
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
from someone else somewhere else
 
04:10:21.600 --> 04:10:23.410 align:start position:0%
from someone else somewhere else
follow-up

04:10:23.410 --> 04:10:23.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
so is there a tax rate that you think
 
04:10:28.610 --> 04:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
would be fair to tax premiums we're at
 
04:10:31.370 --> 04:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
the perfect tax rate right now thank you
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
and one of those three states and it is
 
04:10:35.929 --> 04:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Advantage my customers
 
04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't drive up from multiple States as I
 
04:10:41.809 --> 04:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
told you as I proudly say uh we sell an
 
04:10:43.570 --> 04:10:43.580 align:start position:0%
awful lot of cigars
 
04:10:47.389 --> 04:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
and when they do come up they buy
 
04:10:49.370 --> 04:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets they buy the liquor in
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores they use the
 
04:10:52.610 --> 04:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
restaurants they maybe stay at the
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
hotels they don't use the the roads they
 
04:10:56.990 --> 04:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't use the police they don't use the
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
fire department they drop all their
 
04:11:00.769 --> 04:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
money off to everything and then they
 
04:11:00.779 --> 04:11:01.610 align:start position:0%
money off to everything and then they
leave

04:11:01.610 --> 04:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
leave
 
04:11:04.610 --> 04:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
what better what better customer in the
 
04:11:06.889 --> 04:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
world would you want than this and these
 
04:11:09.889 --> 04:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
people have money yes it is a disposable
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
income type of person and some of these
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
people have a lot of money to drop lots
 
04:11:17.150 --> 04:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
of money off in the State uh don't let
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
them go away because there's nothing but
 
04:11:21.530 --> 04:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
negative that's going to happen they're
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
going to not come anymore and drop it
 
04:11:25.849 --> 04:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
off and you will collect no money just
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
ask Massachusetts they had the same
 
04:11:29.450 --> 04:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
thing that they thought they were going
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
to make a few million dollars in
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in 1995 when they added
 
04:11:36.410 --> 04:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
the tax that was at 12 percent they went
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
to 15 they went to 20 they went to 30
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
they went to 40 and they're still
 
04:11:42.769 --> 04:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
chasing this dream of three million
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
dollars there's one guy left the guy
 
04:11:47.090 --> 04:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't do 3 million in sales you can
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
tax him a ten thousand percent it can't
 
04:11:51.530 --> 04:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
add up to any money that ends up
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
happening it's just bad business
 
04:11:58.250 --> 04:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and um those poor retailers that had
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
to figure out something else after the
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
fact and knock on wood I was one that
 
04:12:06.110 --> 04:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
actually packed my bags and left but uh
 
04:12:08.030 --> 04:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
nobody else followed they stayed they
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
stayed and went down with the ship uh if
 
04:12:12.769 --> 04:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
this was to happen I'm not I'm going to
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
do the same exact thing I'm not going to
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
go down with the ship I'm just going to
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
close shop and maybe go to Florida it's
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
warm there it's you know Cigar City
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps yeah representative Olney has a
 
04:12:23.760 --> 04:12:25.490 align:start position:0%
perhaps yeah representative Olney has a
question

04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I need to ask it of you but
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um can you visualize any way that oh can
 
04:12:36.769 --> 04:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
you visual can you tell us the
 
04:12:40.250 --> 04:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
impediments to us collecting tax on a
 
04:12:42.070 --> 04:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
product which has gone mostly online
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
well that's another thing of collecting
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
the tax so and somebody would have to do
 
04:12:49.130 --> 04:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
it I've asked a question many times of
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
the non
 
04:12:54.170 --> 04:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
um premium cigar how much is really
 
04:12:56.210 --> 04:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
coming in on non-premium cigars and I've
 
04:12:58.729 --> 04:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
asked it year after year and and they
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
have no calculation to it so if it's
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
very minuscule the tax you're collecting
 
04:13:06.530 --> 04:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
on pipe tobacco at 68 it's it's
 
04:13:08.090 --> 04:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing and how much you're
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
getting on non-premium cigars it it's
 
04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing and I could build my
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
business even more if you would not tax
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
that make that go away too because
 
04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're collecting nothing for it and
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
you're just hurting the retailers that
 
04:13:24.769 --> 04:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
are in here so I would go as far as to
 
04:13:27.530 --> 04:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
you know instead of play defensive here
 
04:13:29.809 --> 04:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
play offensive and say will you please
 
04:13:32.210 --> 04:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
take that other tax off that is just
 
04:13:34.729 --> 04:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
sitting there making you no money and
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
hurting the the people of New Hampshire
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
at the same time we could uh do better
 
04:13:43.130 --> 04:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
if we could make that go away as opposed
 
04:13:45.769 --> 04:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
to try to uh what does it cost you to
 
04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
collect the tax
 
04:13:50.150 --> 04:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's uh people that's job is trying
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
to figure that out and neglect it it may
 
04:13:56.090 --> 04:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
be worth less you may be spending more
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
money trying to collect this little
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
04:14:01.610 --> 04:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
um then you then it's worth and I would
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
even go on to say that Massachusetts
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
trying to collect this little 40 percent
 
04:14:09.170 --> 04:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
of this little amount that is happening
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
within that state is probably not worth
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
worth their wild it certainly isn't
 
04:14:15.050 --> 04:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
three million dollars or one million
 
04:14:15.060 --> 04:14:17.630 align:start position:0%
three million dollars or one million
dollars

04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative did I see your hand over
 
04:14:19.680 --> 04:14:22.010 align:start position:0%
representative did I see your hand over
there

04:14:22.010 --> 04:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
dead just for
 
04:14:28.370 --> 04:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
application purposes and I was there
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
when this went through so but when
 
04:14:32.150 --> 04:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the little cigar
 
04:14:34.610 --> 04:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
the cigarillo type thing I seem to
 
04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
recall some testimony regarding its
 
04:14:38.809 --> 04:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
construction compared to that of a
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
premium cigar where premium cigars is a
 
04:14:44.809 --> 04:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
leaf rolled preferably from Connecticut
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
because they make the best uh wrapper
 
04:14:51.410 --> 04:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
and then material from whichever one of
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the various different you know places
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
that makes them Express tobacco
 
04:14:59.570 --> 04:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
but if I remember your testimony at that
 
04:14:59.580 --> 04:15:00.349 align:start position:0%
but if I remember your testimony at that
time

04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:15:03.050 --> 04:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
you were talking about scrapings and
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
floor sweepings and bits and pieces and
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
stuff going into the cigarillo or the
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
little cigar which
 
04:15:13.849 --> 04:15:13.859 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons for the difference
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
is shop tobacco which is how a cigarette
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
is made I mean they can make a thousands
 
04:15:22.250 --> 04:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
and thousands of cigarettes in a minute
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
where a cigar a pair of two people
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
making cigars make 300 per day
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
two people make three hundred cigars per
 
04:15:35.769 --> 04:15:35.779 align:start position:0%
day where the machine makes 300 a second
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
of making these cigarettes whether they
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
use brown paper or white paper that
 
04:15:41.929 --> 04:15:41.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter one other thing that came
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
up back in those days was the
 
04:15:47.689 --> 04:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
um other cigars that you may see in a
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
04:15:52.969 --> 04:15:52.979 align:start position:0%
and those were flavored cigars that if
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
you tip them upside down all the tobacco
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
comes out what why would that end up
 
04:15:59.929 --> 04:15:59.939 align:start position:0%
happening it's little pieces of tobacco
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's inside of this quote cigar and
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
all this was was the wrapper that was
 
04:16:08.210 --> 04:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
used and then it was to be refilled with
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana and this was uh um just
 
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
another way of of rolling as a
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
not a uh I can't think of what that's
 
04:16:21.530 --> 04:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
called the rolling paper I guess that
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
people would
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
um put marijuana in or they would use a
 
04:16:27.650 --> 04:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
leaf which was this cigar that you
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
poured out and I believe we had an
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
example uh representative Almy I think
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
you brought the products in
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you remember back then I brought a
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
lot of products in there was nothing
 
04:16:43.010 --> 04:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
there was banana flavor chocolate flavor
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
orange flavor and very little low levels
 
04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
of tobacco because it was meant it
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
called itself a cigar and it was not a
 
04:16:58.809 --> 04:16:58.819 align:start position:0%
cigar so what we tried to do is say this
 
04:17:02.330 --> 04:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
when I got in the business in 1985 all
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
they wore was cigars and then these
 
04:17:06.530 --> 04:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
companies came in and started making
 
04:17:09.769 --> 04:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
believe their product was a cigar and
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's not so we we were the first state
 
04:17:14.570 --> 04:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
in the country to actually Define what a
 
04:17:16.969 --> 04:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
cigar was just to say these other things
 
04:17:18.050 --> 04:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that gave us the exemption of it the
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
the exemption is cigars the other things
 
04:17:26.090 --> 04:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
if you say why aren't the other cigars
 
04:17:27.650 --> 04:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
or the inexpensive cigars because
 
04:17:30.769 --> 04:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
they're not cigars I know what a cigar
 
04:17:32.809 --> 04:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
is and what a cigar isn't those are not
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
cigars and they're not even pretending
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
to be it's just they're pretending in
 
04:17:39.050 --> 04:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
writing to be as that roll your own
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
cigarette it's not pipe tobacco you
 
04:17:43.969 --> 04:17:43.979 align:start position:0%
cannot smoke it in a pipe it's made for
 
04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
roll your own cigarettes but with tax
 
04:17:47.689 --> 04:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
again in the state it's 68 percent
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
because they call it that but it is
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
different it could there could be maybe
 
04:17:55.130 --> 04:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
a definition of what pipe tobacco is
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
because these other people that do this
 
04:17:59.929 --> 04:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
kind of ruin it for the entire industry
 
04:18:01.550 --> 04:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
making believe that their product is
 
04:18:01.560 --> 04:18:03.790 align:start position:0%
making believe that their product is
different

04:18:03.790 --> 04:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:06.290 --> 04:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Oliver
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
he said with trepidation
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
are you telling me that zigzags are used
 
04:18:15.530 --> 04:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
for something other than tobacco yes yes
 
04:18:19.610 --> 04:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay any serious questions
 
04:18:23.689 --> 04:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative roachford
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm just
 
04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around because I
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
just in full disclosure we have a
 
04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
premium cigar store in my town I've
 
04:18:33.410 --> 04:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
never been into it I wouldn't know
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
a good cigar from a bad cigar
 
04:18:36.359 --> 04:18:37.490 align:start position:0%
a good cigar from a bad cigar
um

04:18:37.490 --> 04:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
but uh I I look at the business that
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
they're doing in my town we're a Border
 
04:18:45.469 --> 04:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
Town bordering Vermont I go up 19 miles
 
04:18:47.570 --> 04:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
north to the town of Lancaster where we
 
04:18:50.689 --> 04:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
have a cigar bar there uh where people
 
04:18:54.290 --> 04:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
come from all around to to to drink and
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
to to smoke cigars
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to understand this and
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
bear with me here and I will get to a
 
04:19:00.600 --> 04:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
bear with me here and I will get to a
question

04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:01.920 --> 04:19:03.590 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay I look at you know efforts to tax
 
04:19:11.090 --> 04:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
flavored cigarettes or flavored tobacco
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
in an effort to get kids off of it but
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
you said this isn't an addictive issue
 
04:19:18.290 --> 04:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's not a health concern or is it a
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
children children aren't interested
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
children aren't in our children aren't
 
04:19:23.330 --> 04:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
interested so we can check that off the
 
04:19:23.340 --> 04:19:24.650 align:start position:0%
interested so we can check that off the
Box

04:19:24.650 --> 04:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
Box
 
04:19:26.570 --> 04:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
am I missing something here I just think
 
04:19:28.370 --> 04:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
that this is a this bill here is a
 
04:19:28.380 --> 04:19:29.450 align:start position:0%
that this is a this bill here is a
solution

04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:19:31.330 --> 04:19:31.340 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
it might I mean I I don't see that this
 
04:19:35.870 --> 04:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
is the pressing issue New Hampshire has
 
04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
to solve today 100
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
all right that's our assessment as well
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.450 --> 04:19:45.460 align:start position:0%

I just like to make a statement i've
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%

age of eight with my cousin we stole it
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
from our grandfather and neither of us
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
ever smoked again
 
04:20:03.290 --> 04:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
it did it it did its duty to stop you
 
04:20:07.330 --> 04:20:07.340 align:start position:0%
for that no childhood like that
 
04:20:10.490 --> 04:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%

members of the committee my name is Kim

Ming Wong tax policy Council of the
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue the department
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on this bill we
 
04:21:11.630 --> 04:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
did prepare a fiscal note on the bill
 
04:21:11.640 --> 04:21:13.250 align:start position:0%
did prepare a fiscal note on the bill
and

04:21:13.250 --> 04:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill as described by the sponsor
 
04:21:21.050 --> 04:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
is uh proposing to tax the premium
 
04:21:24.250 --> 04:21:24.260 align:start position:0%
cigars under the tobacco tax statute
 
04:21:27.469 --> 04:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
when we were preparing the fiscal note
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear to us the tax rate that
 
04:21:34.729 --> 04:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
was going to be used on the cigars so
 
04:21:36.170 --> 04:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
when we prepared this fiscal note we
 
04:21:38.330 --> 04:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
assumed that it is taxed as an other
 
04:21:41.809 --> 04:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
tobacco product which is at 65.03
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:48.769 --> 04:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
um preparing this fiscal note we used as
 
04:21:51.889 --> 04:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
explained in previous testimony there is
 
04:21:57.290 --> 04:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
um no complete information uh for us to
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
calculate the total fiscal impact if uh
 
04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass however we did
 
04:22:06.410 --> 04:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
try to get as much information as
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
possible through looking at the returns
 
04:22:13.610 --> 04:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
that's been submitted so wholesalers do
 
04:22:16.370 --> 04:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
submit a return to us on a monthly basis
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
wholesalers who sell other tobacco
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
products and within that return that
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's called a form dp151 within that
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
return the wholesalers do report
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
the amount of premium cigars that sold
 
04:22:29.689 --> 04:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
and bear in mind this is only for the
 
04:22:33.769 --> 04:22:33.779 align:start position:0%
wholesalers who do sell other tobacco
 
04:22:35.689 --> 04:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
products and they are licensed in New
 
04:22:35.699 --> 04:22:37.670 align:start position:0%
products and they are licensed in New
Hampshire

04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:22:40.969 --> 04:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
so wholesalers that only sell premium
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
cigars will not be captured in this
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
population of our calculation
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
and within our calculation we've
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
determined that it uh that the wholesale
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
price of premium cigars that were sold
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from fiscal year 22 was
 
04:22:57.050 --> 04:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
about 1.4 million dollars and applying
 
04:23:01.370 --> 04:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
the 65.03 percent will give us 967
 
04:23:04.250 --> 04:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of Revenue
 
04:23:06.889 --> 04:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
and as mentioned in previous testimony
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
the dra does not have the capability of
 
04:23:12.189 --> 04:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
determining whether the uh an increase
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
or imposition of this tax would result
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
in a loss in sale or an increase in sale
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
we do not have that capability we're
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
only able to report on what available
 
04:23:27.410 --> 04:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.090 --> 04:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Albany
 
04:23:31.370 --> 04:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
04:23:31.380 --> 04:23:33.189 align:start position:0%
thank you on
we

04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
assumed that a number of the people who
 
04:23:38.929 --> 04:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
were buying on
 
04:23:42.050 --> 04:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
in place are going to be buying online
 
04:23:46.490 --> 04:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any way to find those people
 
04:23:49.070 --> 04:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
I I not to my knowledge that we're able
 
04:23:51.769 --> 04:23:51.779 align:start position:0%
to determine whether the um they're
 
04:23:54.889 --> 04:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
buying online or buy at the store most
 
04:23:57.550 --> 04:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
likely if they're buying online
 
04:24:00.530 --> 04:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
any purchases that's done online the
 
04:24:02.330 --> 04:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
consumer will be the ones who are
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
reporting the taxes versus if they're
 
04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
buying at the store the uh the host the
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
wholesaler will have to report that tax
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that that probably would be the only
 
04:24:12.849 --> 04:24:12.859 align:start position:0%
way we could determine that
 
04:24:15.650 --> 04:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
for the case of cigarettes on
 
04:24:19.800 --> 04:24:21.229 align:start position:0%
for the case of cigarettes on
the

04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:27.250 --> 04:24:27.260 align:start position:0%
the on cigarette the tobacco settlement
 
04:24:31.490 --> 04:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
includes fibbing on everybody who bought
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco bought cigarettes online from
 
04:24:38.769 --> 04:24:38.779 align:start position:0%
the participating manufacturers that is
 
04:24:41.689 --> 04:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
and you go after them
 
04:24:44.689 --> 04:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
but there is no such mechanism I think
 
04:24:44.699 --> 04:24:46.370 align:start position:0%
but there is no such mechanism I think
for

04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
for any other product yeah I I believe
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
not since if it's not covered under the
 
04:24:59.450 --> 04:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.090 --> 04:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:25:05.100 --> 04:25:06.349 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
your fiscal note calculations are based
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
on a static analysis and therefore
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're predicated on current sales
 
04:25:15.530 --> 04:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
volume that is correct do you imagine
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the imposition of a 65 percent
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale tax
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
would dampen sales volume and therefore
 
04:25:25.990 --> 04:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the anticipated Revenue
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
without being able to quantify it does
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
that seem likely
 
04:25:32.809 --> 04:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
we we would not be able to predict
 
04:25:36.650 --> 04:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
consumer Behavior so it's we would not
 
04:25:40.370 --> 04:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you point made
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
04:25:50.929 --> 04:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming thank you
 
04:25:53.149 --> 04:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more pink cards is
 
04:25:54.889 --> 04:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
there anyone else here who would like to
 
04:26:00.290 --> 04:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:02.450 --> 04:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
 
04:26:02.460 --> 04:26:20.630 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
hearing

04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
we will now open the public hearing on
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 568.
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh we have received an email message I
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
hope everyone on the committee received
 
04:26:32.040 --> 04:26:32.809 align:start position:0%
hope everyone on the committee received
it

04:26:32.809 --> 04:26:32.819 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:26:34.849 --> 04:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
um from the prime sponsor who said he
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
did not want to move forward with this
 
04:26:36.479 --> 04:26:37.729 align:start position:0%
did not want to move forward with this
bill

04:26:37.729 --> 04:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
I believe it still would be in order for
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
someone to introduce it and then we
 
04:26:45.170 --> 04:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
could conclude the public hearing uh
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows would you care to
 
04:27:05.229 --> 04:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.610 --> 04:27:09.620 align:start position:0%
the bill before us today is House Bill
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
568 relative to assessing all estate
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education and local Education
 
04:27:17.809 --> 04:27:17.819 align:start position:0%

04:27:17.819 --> 04:27:19.130 align:start position:0%

warrant
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
and because I am not the sponsor I don't
 
04:27:26.090 --> 04:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
have any testimony to offer about this
 
04:27:26.100 --> 04:27:27.229 align:start position:0%
have any testimony to offer about this
bill

04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:27:29.210 --> 04:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for so much for introducing
 
04:27:32.450 --> 04:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
the bill and let me just read the email
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
that we received from the prime sponsor
 
04:27:39.530 --> 04:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sanborn uh yes I guess
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
it was sent to me and I hopefully
 
04:27:42.889 --> 04:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
forwarded it to everyone else I have
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
decided not to follow through with House
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 568 FN relative to assessing All
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
State adequate education and local
 
04:27:51.410 --> 04:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
Education costs through the State
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
education warrant I would like to
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw it the bill is not written the
 
04:27:58.010 --> 04:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
way I intended and the timing is not
 
04:28:00.110 --> 04:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
right for amending
 
04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
uh please advise me if there's anything
 
04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
else I need to do to vacate the bill so
 
04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
the gentleman requested the bill to be
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
vacated but it was too late to be
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
vacated per the house clerk because it
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
already been scheduled for public
 
04:28:14.570 --> 04:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
hearing here so that's why we've opened
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing uh is there anyone in
 
04:28:19.490 --> 04:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
the audience here to testify on House
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.370 --> 04:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
anyone from the committee have anything
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
to say yes representative am I correct
 
04:28:30.530 --> 04:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
that if uh with a situation like this if
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
the minority leader and the chair agree
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
we could exec immediately and uh dispose
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
of it I believe uh that is the new house
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
rule that we've adopted
 
04:28:43.490 --> 04:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
um we have not discussed this at all so
 
04:28:46.130 --> 04:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to presume anything but
 
04:28:47.689 --> 04:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
we can certainly close the public
 
04:28:47.699 --> 04:28:49.130 align:start position:0%
we can certainly close the public
hearing

04:28:49.130 --> 04:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
and we can discuss whether an immediate
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
exec session would be an order so with
 
04:28:55.370 --> 04:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
that I will close a public hearing on
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
so uh this is a public work session of
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
the entire house Ways and Means
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
Committee and we are discussing House
 
04:30:39.889 --> 04:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
Bill 568 as well as a recently passed
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
house rule that would allow us to
 
04:30:44.809 --> 04:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
immediately go into an executive session
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
on a bill if we have agreement uh
 
04:30:50.570 --> 04:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
between the chair the members of the
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee and the ranking member of the
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee to exec a bill that was just
 
04:30:57.290 --> 04:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
heard that same day
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we have a situation here in front of us
 
04:31:02.090 --> 04:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 568 which the prime
 
04:31:04.370 --> 04:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
sponsor has asked us not to move forward
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
with so I believe we have consensus
 
04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative only would you like to
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%

04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
04:31:18.170 --> 04:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
okay so we will now enter the an
 
04:31:21.290 --> 04:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 568 and
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
the chair will recognize representative
 
04:31:27.769 --> 04:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%

well we can put a bill on consent
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
calendar with a unanimous vote this one
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
does have an FN but we can put it on
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
consent calendar because it's an ideal
 
04:33:50.570 --> 04:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
motion so we will put on consent unless
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
anyone objects
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
