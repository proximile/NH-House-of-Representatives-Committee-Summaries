no we don't really need to i have
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
everybody here to cheer mark just being
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
in attendance so
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
i think so thank you so the purpose of
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
is to address
 
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.550 align:start position:0%
is to address
uh

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
interim study we
 
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.350 align:start position:0%
interim study we
sent

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
sent
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
eight bills to interim study these were
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
bills that for one reason or another
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
we didn't feel that we were able to make
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
a recommendation on at the time
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
of our hearings
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have really three alternatives today
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i've talked to the clerk
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk tells me that
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
our job is to make a recommendation on
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
each of these bills
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
as to whether we recommend for further
 
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
as to whether we recommend for further
legislation

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
we recommend against further legislation
 
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.950 align:start position:0%
we recommend against further legislation
or

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
today if we're not prepared to do either
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
one of those two things to establish a
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
so i thought we'd go through the bills
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
each of them today i think there's some
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
that we may be able to make a
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation on and there might be
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
some that we want to actually establish
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
and i've handed out a sheet
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
which was prepared by
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
our researcher attorney for
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
for us which i really appreciate
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
which provides an explanation of each of
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
the bill or at least provides the
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
committee report that we submitted on
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
each of the bills that we sent to
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll just go through them in order
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
the first bill is house bill 124
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
adopting the uniform real property
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
transfer on death act uh mr chairman yes
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
just for clarification
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
if we decide today
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to recommend uh
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
no further legislation
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
on bill
 
00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:52.869 align:start position:0%
on bill
uh

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
can we is that can we take that as
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
dispositive action today
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that we could take that as
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
this positive action today
 
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.749 align:start position:0%
this positive action today
no

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me but we don't have a farm
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
i would i guess in my mind i would
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
consider this as the recommendation of
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
the work session
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
that would go
 
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:33.829 align:start position:0%
that would go
to

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
at some time in september or
 
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.630 align:start position:0%
at some time in september or
october

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
october
 
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.469 align:start position:0%
october
um

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
at which point we could just vote on
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
everything including if there are bills
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
where we have in fact created
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
like you might want to check with the
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
cleric but i think we've had a farm we
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
can't take an official vote okay
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
i agree with marjorie it just doesn't
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
feel right to yes thank you that's a
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
small number of people
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm fine with me
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
and in the fall of some of the members
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
who are absent they're going to be
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
absent in the fall then that'll give the
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
two caucus officers time to round up
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think that a subcommittee or the
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
working group would make the
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee but
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's the full committee
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of quorum is needed to make
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
the final
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation also um the options for
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation not recommend
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislation or send it to the
 
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.389 align:start position:0%
legislation or send it to the
subcommittee

00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think it perhaps
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
is something that would be referred for
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
future legislation but
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i would want to be
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
involved it seems like a rather in-depth
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
sort of work session that would be
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
needed along with
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
probably many other entities
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know giving their input on it so
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
it is there an option to
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation without
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
doing the study on it
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay just wanted to confirm that i
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
believe that there is and
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
those two pieces of legislation
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with the transfer on death deeds
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
i've contacted
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
the attorneys that
 
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.829 align:start position:0%
the attorneys that
that

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
came and spoke
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
at the hearing and
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
pointed out the issues with regard to
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
i am one of the attorneys for the tne
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and we're happy to
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
take both of those on we're looking at a
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
fall timeline just so you're aware thank
 
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.030 align:start position:0%
fall timeline just so you're aware thank
you

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's what he's going to say is they
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
they've agreed that
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they would come back in the fall
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
with a proposal for legislation so i
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a need for to create
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative and of course pointing
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
out the very the obvious some hp 124 is
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
appears to be
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
identical to sb243 except for the last
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
page which is uh
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
just like uh
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and those aren't major policy
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
points on the last page obviously you
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
want to one subcommittee look at both of
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
stupefyingly obvious point but felt the
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
we want to do the formality of having
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
someone make a
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
motion that we recommend this for
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative smith would you like to
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
it would be that on both bills house
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill 124 and
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
so i guess i would rather since they
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second to
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
represent smith's motion
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative sylvia and
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak with for just
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
30 seconds you can
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
take all the time i would point out
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
to those people
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
on the committee and those people in the
 
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
on the committee and those people in the
audience

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
audience
 
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.150 align:start position:0%
audience
that

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're sympathetic to these bills we
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
think they need
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and we're not
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
incumbents um
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
who may or may not be elected in
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
november but as long as there are
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
covenants now can in fact file
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
legislation for the next
 
00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
legislation for the next
term

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
so that if um outside groups are working
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
on any of these
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things they might want to
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
think about is identifying potential
 
00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.509 align:start position:0%
think about is identifying potential
sponsors

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
more carefully drafted
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation and actually filed them
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
starting in september so they don't have
 
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.710 align:start position:0%
starting in september so they don't have
to

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
they they will come back here for a
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
final vote but meanwhile on another
 
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.710 align:start position:0%
final vote but meanwhile on another
track

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
progress could be made on processing
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
i hope my
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
the filing dates for september are begin
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
on september 6th
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
and they end on september 16th
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
as any other discussion on the motion
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
and the motion is to
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
recommend house bill 124 for further
 
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.470 align:start position:0%
recommend house bill 124 for further
legislation

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
we need a roll call mr blair
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we do
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
since it's just a work session and you
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
know we're going to do is make a
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee so
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think show hands or nodding of the
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
heads will be sufficient
 
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
heads will be sufficient
okay

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
all those in
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
in favor raise your hand
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
 
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
right

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 248 relative to the judicial
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
and he
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
did not indicate that there he felt that
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
there was a continuing need for
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
and is there a second to that
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.269 align:start position:0%
and is there a second to that
exactly

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
second by representative wilper
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
i um just
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of background
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
as you may recall
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
when it first came in there was a
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
discussion with regard to the need to do
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
a further actuarial study to determine
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
what the effect of the change would be
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the concern was the amount of money
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
that currently the state or the court
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
really is contributing towards the plan
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that was sustainable
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think they did the actuarial study and
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
found out that there wasn't it didn't
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
really make that much difference in
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
terms of the state's contribution so i
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
think it there wasn't a continuing
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion for on
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
house bill 248
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
that motion being not recommended for
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.029 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
hand

00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 379 relative to electronic
 
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:56.390 align:start position:0%
house bill 379 relative to electronic
notice

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative anders i know that when i
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
sent out an earlier email you indicated
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
that you might be interested in
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm very much interested in the
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
right to know law in new hampshire
 
00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
right to know law in new hampshire
and

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think we have to have a real in-depth
 
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.310 align:start position:0%
i think we have to have a real in-depth
study

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
on everything
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
because if we make changes it has to
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
affect every agency everything in the
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire schools i mean
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
everything we can't have two or three
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
different laws
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
and we have to make sure
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
that when we're done every citizen in
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has a way of
 
00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:47.230 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has a way of
receiving

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.870 align:start position:0%
receiving
notification

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.909 align:start position:0%
notification
and

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
many don't have electronics
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
so we get we i think we have to figure
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
out what we really want to do because
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have to consider every person in the
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.430 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
representative

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
so i totally agree in terms of the right
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
to know act but this notice can go way
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
because there's all kinds of notices
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
that are required in our state
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
quite sure even if we put something in
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
the right to no act except for the
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we could avoid that but when you
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
start talking about like
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
foreclosures and and marriages
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
divorces whatever
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of these notices that
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
have to be made public and
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
i i personally just don't think we're in
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
a place where we could possibly
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
avoid the intent of this is to avoid the
 
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
avoid the intent of this is to avoid the
newspapers

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
newspapers
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i and i don't see what
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
even being in a place where we could
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
seriously consider that so
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
i would just say like i guess i would
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
recommend future action but i wouldn't
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
want to try and do a study committee for
 
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.950 align:start position:0%
want to try and do a study committee for
it

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh let me understand what you just said
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
you you would recommend further
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislative action or
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
well it's uh it's what representative
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
andrews said at some point
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do this
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
right and it's a burdensome
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
right now on everybody to use newspapers
 
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
right now on everybody to use newspapers
and

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm about to campaign in barrington i
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
have no idea if there was even a
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
newspaper of general circulation within
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
barrington that i could go to to place
 
00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:36.390 align:start position:0%
barrington that i could go to to place
advertising

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
but the requirements are all over the
 
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.669 align:start position:0%
but the requirements are all over the
place

00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
and and there is a lot of people who
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily go to a website
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
or even think of going to a website to
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
look for a note to say of a hearing in
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
so so yes eventually we need to be there
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's in the future
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's far future is what i'm
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
saying as opposed to the near future
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
and are you in favor of doing a study
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
committee a separate study committee or
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
are you saying
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
we need to we could recommend further
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislation without having a
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
study committee i see i don't see any
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
way that a study committee can come up
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
with any reasonable solution to this
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
now or even within the next i mean
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
so no i would not favor a formal study
 
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.510 align:start position:0%
so no i would not favor a formal study
committee

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan yes the
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
newspapers i mean i know
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
all our stage newspapers are mere shadow
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
of what they all are but i think they
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
still have their place people are going
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
to see these notices you might not be
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
know where to look for them on the
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
website and also the
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
newspaper every copy is at least in
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
theory exactly the same so there's never
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
any ambiguity about what the notice said
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
you could run into that with these
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
electronic notices people could
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
i could see like we had
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
a few of our friends who come in from
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
time to time i can imagine them like
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
forging a notice or
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
whatever so that's um
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
and also well
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
newspapers that run the bulk of the
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
notices um they do maintain an
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
electronic archive which is uh available
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
though not necessarily for free like
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
which because it's mostly uh
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
most of them most of the ones most of
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
them are run by the union leader or to
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
lesser extent by the seacoast newspapers
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the valley news and the concord
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
monitor and those are all like
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
electronically archived so there still
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
electronic copy they can look at and see
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
you can more confidence that that's uh
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
accurate than if you're just trying to
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
find the uh
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
government agencies website so i think
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think there's still a i think there's
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
still a place where they have a third
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
party that prints these princes notices
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
as for running ads in barrington there
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
is still uh the fosters daily democrat
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
and dover is still
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
in general circulation although actually
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
usually we get more news coverage about
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
the seacoast and the union leader than
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
in our what's obsessively our local
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
paper but
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
both of those still do run um
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
both of those still run a lot of notices
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
in fact that's probably one of their
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
major sources of revenue unfortunately
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
but so i would say uh i'd say the time
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
has not come to like eliminate the
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
requirement to print them in the
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
newspaper although
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think um in my
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
trying to process this i'm i'm
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
separating out
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
the importance of the issue
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
from the appropriateness
 
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
from the appropriateness
of

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
of
our

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
recommending action on a particular
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think the issue is very important but
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
if i were to choose how to vote and i
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
guess at some point i will on 379
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.029 align:start position:0%
i would say
no

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
no
uh

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
no recommend
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
not recommending uh
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
further legislation
because

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
i recognize the importance of the issue
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we're anywhere near
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
where we have an idea of what the
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative wilbur so it sounds to me
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
like we have agreement on the situation
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
and the only question is do we want to
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
say yay or nay to
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
future legislation and so i would uh
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
willingly vote no for future legislation
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
because that'll be taken as like future
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
legislation right now
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
so i'd be i'd be happy to go on with no
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
recommend no future legislation
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
and if the chairs accepted that as a
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
motion i would say
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative wilbur having made the
 
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.950 align:start position:0%
uh representative wilbur having made the
motion

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
and representative smith having seconded
 
00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
and representative smith having seconded
it

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
we have a motion that we
 
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.110 align:start position:0%
we have a motion that we
recommend

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we not recommend further
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
the i think at some point in time the
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
issue needs to be addressed but i don't
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
think we're at a point where we can make
 
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.470 align:start position:0%
think we're at a point where we can make
any

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
any type of specific recommendation as
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
to what that should be at this point in
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
time so i
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
think the the
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
angular discussion
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
follows in favor of the motion please
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
the motion passes
 
00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:08.390 align:start position:0%
the motion passes
7-0

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1181
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
allowing a biological father of an
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
unborn child to petition a court for an
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
injunction prohibiting the biological
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative i know in our earlier
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
emails you indicated that you might be
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
amenable to having a study committee
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman i think this is an
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
important issue and it's one that does
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed and
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
both save lives and enhance the quality
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
of life for a lot of fathers
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah i'd be i'd be willing to chair a
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on it
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
if the other members don't feel like
 
00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:49.590 align:start position:0%
if the other members don't feel like
there's

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
any real benefit or
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the issue is too difficult and i'll
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
crime sponsor and we'll come back with
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair while i completely
 
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair while i completely
respect

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
my

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
colleagues interest in the issue
 
00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:21.269 align:start position:0%
colleagues interest in the issue
um

00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:24.310 align:start position:0%
i think that
he

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
just made a
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
very valid point and that is
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
in this particular situation
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
what might be the most appropriate
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
actually work with those people
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
committed to this issue
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
to draft legislation
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
to come before the future
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislature the legislature
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
elected in november
 
00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:53.909 align:start position:0%
elected in november
and

00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
therefore following the reasoning that
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
we've tried to apply up until now that
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.029 align:start position:0%
as far as
our

00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
current committee
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
it would be to
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
not recommend
 
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.470 align:start position:0%
not recommend
further

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
further
legislation

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
which clearly
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
only means
 
00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:19.029 align:start position:0%
only means
that

00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for pursuing the
 
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for pursuing the
issue

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
would fall with the
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
the to those
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.149 align:start position:0%
any other
comments

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
i think this is uh
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
an interesting and difficult question
 
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
an interesting and difficult question
um

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things looking at the bill
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and starting out is this could be a
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
petition to
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
the family division
 
00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.269 align:start position:0%
the family division
of

00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to avoid
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
certain words
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
not functioning at an optimal level
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
and of course it would be questions of
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
so i i think it
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
it needs further legislation certainly
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
needs study
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know that the committee will
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
come to any solid ground on this
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
so um i i
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
assume that uh the the sponsors will
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
come back with another version
 
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.669 align:start position:0%
come back with another version
and

00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
so i would i would lean towards uh
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
indeed sporting future legislation
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
you would i'm sorry
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
i would support a recommendation of
 
00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.110 align:start position:0%
i would support a recommendation of
uh

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the study committee will
 
00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the study committee will
produce

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
produce
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
it could i i i
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
not entirely certain i would want to be
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
on it but i i
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.230 align:start position:0%
i would
certainly

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
want to accord
 
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.149 align:start position:0%
want to accord
uh

00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:30.789 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative walker can i before i
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
call on you to comment
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh do you know of anyone else who would
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh no mr chairman uh
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
not this is up to the other members of
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
the committee if any of them if
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
if if if the study committee is going to
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
be me
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
so that's my answer
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
but no one has uh stepped up to say oh
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
i'd like to do on that with you as i did
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
so i guess this is uh you know sort of
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
the way i feel about it is
 
00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.950 align:start position:0%
the way i feel about it is
is

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
as an option here today if i have a
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee member who says you know i
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
would like to take the time to study it
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'd probably want to submit the to
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
support my committee member
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
the feeling at the time and let them do
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
their study and then come back with a
 
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.070 align:start position:0%
their study and then come back with a
recommendation

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
do i do that if there's only
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
one person who's going to be doing the
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
study and i guess
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
we could do that basically
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
just defer the question for now until we
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
have our further meeting of the
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee and allow you to come back
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
with making some recommendation at the
 
00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:07.430 align:start position:0%
with making some recommendation at the
time

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
well i hear what you're saying and
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
i believe as representative wolfer who
 
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.230 align:start position:0%
i believe as representative wolfer who
knows

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
knows
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
despite our
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
long-held disagreement on this issue we
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
very supportive of each other in terms
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
of acting responsibly as legislators
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
if representative wooper is going to
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
look at this issue himself and with
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
others who share his
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
commitment to
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
developing appropriate legislation
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think that happens outside of the
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
current judiciary committee
 
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.750 align:start position:0%
current judiciary committee
and

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
what we would see probably before
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
we meet again to finalize the decisions
 
00:32:56.559 --> 00:32:57.509 align:start position:0%
we meet again to finalize the decisions
that

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
or the recommendations that we make
 
00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
or the recommendations that we make
today

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
is the likelihood of draft legislation
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
having been filed with ols
 
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.509 align:start position:0%
having been filed with ols
so

00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's even necessarily
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
to say that we are creating an interim
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
um it reminds me of what
 
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.230 align:start position:0%
um it reminds me of what
uh

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
john kennedy said when he
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
winners and um
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
he said he thought this was the most
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
incredible gathering of intelligence
 
00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
incredible gathering of intelligence
since

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
thomas jefferson had dined alone
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
and in this case
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative welker can dine alone
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman i pretty much have to
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
agree that's a study committee of one
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
so are you supporting a recommendation
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
of no further legislation
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
and and who would like to make that
 
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.589 align:start position:0%
and and who would like to make that
motion

00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
if in fact you're looking for such
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
emotion um and of respect for all of my
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
colleagues i would make that motion
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
just one
 
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.950 align:start position:0%
just one
observation

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
observation
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and i although no on this
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation with all due respect
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
would benefit
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
from having
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
parties that are not in support of this
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
idea and see if there is any sort of
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
middle ground that might be reached
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
obviously you know this is very
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
abortion is a divisive issue
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
the right of the parents um
 
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.230 align:start position:0%
the right of the parents um
is

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little less divisive and
 
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.430 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little less divisive and
perhaps

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
um there is more
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
possibility of a middle ground but
 
00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.829 align:start position:0%
possibility of a middle ground but
that's

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
but you have just indicated i thought
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
that you didn't want to serve on such a
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen anyone else who has
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
chosen to be here today who has
 
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.910 align:start position:0%
chosen to be here today who has
indicated

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anyone who has
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
contacted either the chair or the
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
leader on this committee who would
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
and so
um

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
with all due respect um
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think you know you're either
 
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.030 align:start position:0%
uh i think you know you're either
interaction

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
and you can't be both although as
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
you and i know we frequently try to have
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
conversations about why
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who don't believe in
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
government at all
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
nonetheless believe that they have a
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
right to control
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
a woman's body but we can have that
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussion another time
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that you either have
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
to step up to the plate and say yes you
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
work with representative welper
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
and uh try to
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
produce something that the full
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee would accept
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
when we have no obligation
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
as a committee to write legislation
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
um either that or you have to say it's
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
an important issue and representative
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
wealth is going to pursue it on its own
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
not worry about what you might
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
say subsequently to someone who will ask
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
you well so how come you didn't
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
advocate for this
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative wilpert
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
so just to
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that we have
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous votes
 
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:47.990 align:start position:0%
unanimous votes
right

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
but there
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh there is it seems to me that there's
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
another alternative here and that is i
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
don't think we're under any obligation
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
today to come up with a final
 
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.630 align:start position:0%
today to come up with a final
recommendation

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
so i don't think
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
we have to come up with a recommendation
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
today one way or the other or even
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
create a study committee today
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
if the full committee is going to be
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
coming back again so
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
one of our options today it seems to me
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
agree that we're going to not going to
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
take any action on this today
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
and then when we come back for a full
 
00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:24.710 align:start position:0%
and then when we come back for a full
committee

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative wolfer is that an
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
indication you want to speak no it's
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
insane it's interesting
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
so it's an interesting idea
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it sounds to me like
 
00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:42.230 align:start position:0%
mr chairman it sounds to me like
uh

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna we'll just not do
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
anything today we'll kick that can down
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
the road and when we come back together
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
if there's legislation already drafted
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
then we'll recommend
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
that well we'll decide whether or not to
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know well the the thing is that
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
and the way i'm the the reason i suggest
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
that today is that
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
we have seven people here today
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there were other people
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
who might volunteer
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
on our committee to be on a subcommittee
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
if if we had the full committee here i
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if representative notter
 
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
don't know if representative notter
might

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
agree to be on the subcommittee or
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative merner be on a
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative chase be on the
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so long and short is
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
i guess the question is should the seven
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
of us decide to make that recommendation
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
today when we don't necessarily have to
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
make that recommendation
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
this chair i would be happy to withdraw
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
my motion and leave a blank slate
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh here tabula rosso for us
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
on this phil i don't know what in fact
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
i i can speak for
 
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
i i can speak for
10

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.069 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
and

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
and
say

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
say
that

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
10 members of the committee
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
have been asked on three or four
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
different occasions do you have any
 
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
different occasions do you have any
interest

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
in serving on
 
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
in serving on
any

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
interim study committees of any of these
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
bills that are before the judiciary
 
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.069 align:start position:0%
bills that are before the judiciary
committee

00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
and um i have had responses from every
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
one of those people
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
and only one person has responded saying
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh she has interest in serving on
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
one interim study committee and it's not
 
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:47.349 align:start position:0%
one interim study committee and it's not
this

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
i can speak i
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
believe with
 
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
believe with
authority

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.710 align:start position:0%
authority
that

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
of the
seven

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
democrats who are not here not one of
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
representatives yes i would be reluctant
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
to serve in this subcommittee because
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just so
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
viscerally horrified by the basic aim of
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
it i'm not sure whether
 
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
it i'm not sure whether
um

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
a man even if it is the father forcing a
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
woman to give birth against their will
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
is uh that's something very hard for me
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
to accept under any circumstances even
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
if there's all this due process in here
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
but the problem i mean
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
and bill's probably on aside from that
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
the bill's probably unnecessary and i
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into the law relating to
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
paternity testing but i'm sure there's
 
00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.630 align:start position:0%
paternity testing but i'm sure there's
uh

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
we've been doing paternity testing even
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
before we knew about dna so it's
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
probably like a large body of law and
 
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
probably like a large body of law and
somebody

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
somebody might want to look into us
 
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.309 align:start position:0%
somebody might want to look into us
looking

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
look into that before we meet in
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
september i don't recall that coming up
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
at all at the uh at the at the hearing
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
or during our executive session on it
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
but there's um
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't know where that would meet
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the sponsors of this
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
since you know
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
since uh you know paternity testing is a
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
long-established medical procedure and
 
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
long-established medical procedure and
maybe

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
maybe there's improvements made to the
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
laws or the regulations regulating that
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
but that's not really
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
probably the intent of this bill so i
 
00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:20.950 align:start position:0%
probably the intent of this bill so i
would

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes i would i would certainly like i
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
would certainly not want to serve on a
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee related to this issue even
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
though it's a very very hot topic which
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
vigorously uh debated next year here in
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
concord and and
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
and every other legislative body so
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's where i'm coming from on
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.109 align:start position:0%
 
else

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
personally i just prefer
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
not making a recommendation today with
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
the seven of us and waiting for the full
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
committee to do that mr chair would it
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for me to withdraw my
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
promotion and uh to see if in fact uh
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo would withdraw
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to withdraw the second
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
place thank you very much
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
move that we make no recommendation at
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
this time and wait till we have our full
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo we can second
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.150 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
hand

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1389
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a superior court
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
i did talk to the sponsor again
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
who was representative lynn this morning
 
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.910 align:start position:0%
who was representative lynn this morning
he

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
he's sort of
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
i i i guess the best way to describe is
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
sort of ambivalent about it and that
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh he sees the potential value of a land
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
use docket
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
on the other side
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
he sees that
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we all had and that
 
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we all had and that
was

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to give the court
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
another judge and or 500 000
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
is that actually the best use of the fun
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.109 align:start position:0%
is that actually the best use of the fun
so

00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
he was sort of
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
up in the air as to
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
he didn't feel strongly one way or
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
another as to what the committee did
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
today i guess is the best way to say it
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i know this is a
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
work session i don't know if there
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
happens to be anybody sitting in the
 
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
happens to be anybody sitting in the
room

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
who uh might be in a position to tell us
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
what in fact
 
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.150 align:start position:0%
what in fact
the

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
would

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
like us to do
 
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.630 align:start position:0%
like us to do
but

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
we are now entering a budget year
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch should be well into
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
the process
of

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
constructing what it is going to submit
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
to the governor
 
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.190 align:start position:0%
to the governor
and

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh that would be
 
00:45:47.359 --> 00:45:48.150 align:start position:0%
uh that would be
the

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
ideal place
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
if the judicial branch was seriously
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
considering a change in its structure
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
and at the same time
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
a need for additional funds to carry out
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
that purpose and so um
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
that being the case i i think
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
um again
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
to say that we are not recommending
 
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.109 align:start position:0%
to say that we are not recommending
further

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.710 align:start position:0%
further
uh

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
action does not mean
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
that we're making a decision on
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
the merits or the cost
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
of this but that it's just not
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time for this
 
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time for this
committee

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
represent do you want to address that
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
i've represented that attorney excuse
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
get demoted
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
i won't say what direction that is
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
um good morning thank you my name is
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
richard head i'm the government affairs
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch
 
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch
as

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
in recognition of the comments that were
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
made during the extent during the
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
executive session i did send a follow-up
 
00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
executive session i did send a follow-up
letter

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
and noted that the judicial branch
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
supports the policy behind this bill um
 
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
supports the policy behind this bill um
of

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
improving the the speed at which um
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
appeals from land use boards are
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
are conducted in the in the judicial
 
00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:16.870 align:start position:0%
are conducted in the in the judicial
branch

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh we do support the legislation for
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i think similar to
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i can't say specifically
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chief justice obviously
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not there's going to be
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
a recommendation for the position in the
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
in the recommended budget
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but he does support this legislation
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
does support the idea behind it
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think similar to
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
one of the earlier bills where there may
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
be an expectation that something would
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
be brought forward next session
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
it would be i think a helpful
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation if the policy behind this
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill of expediting the the reviews um by
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch of land use appeals
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh is warranted i think a positive
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation of future legislation
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
would be helpful towards moving that
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
along without
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need to study it further but
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
it i think it would be a positive policy
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation in that regard if if
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
there was a recommendation of future
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislation um i think that if it was a
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps be
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
be reviewed negatively if we were to try
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
to bring that position forward so i
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
think a positive recommendation leaves
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
at least that door open a little bit
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
better for for the judicial branch
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
for that information it's very helpful
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me if um
 
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me if um
the

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
went through a process in which they
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
decided that given um
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
the caseload that they have across
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
disparate areas
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
the potential shortage of
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
judges and support staff
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the entire
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
that they made a calculated decision
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
that it is land use
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
that should be brought to the top
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the list in order to make sure that
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
land use
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
issues moved at a rate
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
more rapidly than
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
all the others so thank you for the
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
question i think the
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
probably the short answer is
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
no in that sense but we have heard
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
through through
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
multiple pieces of legislation
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
that this is an area of priority for the
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
legislative branch um so we saw it in
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the what was interesting in the
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
in remember which bill senate bill 400
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately ended up in because it was
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
tacked on to another bill and then
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think it was actually the bill on the
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
parking garage um
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
the issue that bill had specific
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
deadlines built into it for appeals from
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
land use boards and it's my
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
understanding from the comments that
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
were made is that representative osborne
 
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.470 align:start position:0%
were made is that representative osborne
had

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
asked that that be pulled out in light
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
of this very meeting here today
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
to discuss the land use boards
 
00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:43.589 align:start position:0%
to discuss the land use boards
so

00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
i do think there is a
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
a strong
 
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
a strong
legislative

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
support for this so i think we're
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
reacting to that as opposed to saying
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know all of the areas of law that
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
the that the
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
superior court reviews or the judicial
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
branch reviews you know which ones
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
should be given higher priority you know
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
there are a number of them that i think
 
00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:10.069 align:start position:0%
there are a number of them that i think
we

00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
there might be agreement on i think
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
family division might be one of them
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
but i do think
 
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:16.330 align:start position:0%
land use is
 
00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:17.589 align:start position:0%
land use is
[Music]

00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
an area in which there is strong support
 
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.190 align:start position:0%
an area in which there is strong support
for

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
um for having a faster review in large
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
part because the nature of those
 
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.790 align:start position:0%
part because the nature of those
projects

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
do you remember i don't have the omnibus
 
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.750 align:start position:0%
do you remember i don't have the omnibus
uh

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
compromise bill in front of me do you
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
have remember which one of the sections
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the many sections of that
 
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.670 align:start position:0%
of the many sections of that
so

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
no is the short answer um it was because
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
the dhhs large bill got pulled into that
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
also um i don't remember and i don't
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
have in front of me that that that bill
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
um most of senate bill 400 stayed in the
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
final version um but the specific
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
sections that dealt with the deadlines
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the superior court were pulled in
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
the comment was this bill
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
so at the time when
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
are you saying that at the time that the
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislature was making final uh taking
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
final dispositive action on this
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
that section
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
was removed
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct and my interpretation and
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
i'm only speaking from an audience
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
member's perspective the comment was
 
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.030 align:start position:0%
member's perspective the comment was
made

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.710 align:start position:0%
made
that

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
the issue of timing and deadlines
 
00:52:39.359 --> 00:52:40.790 align:start position:0%
the issue of timing and deadlines
was

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
would be considered as part of today's
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
session on this particular bill thank
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
you just if i could just follow up one
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
more and when you say that there's
 
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:51.829 align:start position:0%
more and when you say that there's
strong

00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
legislative support for that
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
you noted um the majority leader and we
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
certainly know you know the major role
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
that he has played in this
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
in this current term
 
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.589 align:start position:0%
in this current term
um

00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand who else was
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
since there are 400 members
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
who else shares that of i guess
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
let's see that favorite was
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative lynn on this one too
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes um so those two uh
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes so can you tell me who else in
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.510 align:start position:0%
addition to
uh

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
former justice lynn and
 
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:31.510 align:start position:0%
former justice lynn and
uh

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh majority leader osborne
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
were part of this
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
cohort that legislative cohort that took
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
a major position on this
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
so noah's the short answer it was a
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
comment made during the
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
um committee of conference by one of the
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
republican members of that of that
 
00:53:50.079 --> 00:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
republican members of that of that
committee

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
um that i'm that i'm referring to
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
obviously i wouldn't speak for the from
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
any other members other than just
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
the comment i specifically heard
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
one of the other aspects of this i think
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
is you know we also have the
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh separate administrative docket that
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
that is an option that
 
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.069 align:start position:0%
that is an option that
um

00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
provides excuse me some relief for a
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
subset of appeals
 
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.069 align:start position:0%
subset of appeals
um

00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
they deal with residential or
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
residential related appeals so the the
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
data pellet board is an option but it
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover all types of land use
 
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.309 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover all types of land use
decisions

00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
um so but that i think is further
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
evidence of at least a legislative
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
interest in having a more rapid review
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
of of these types of projects or these
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
types of appeals
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful and of
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
course in that particular case we did
 
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.589 align:start position:0%
course in that particular case we did
agree

00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the creation of a special board we
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
now had not quite
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
experience there relatively few cases
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
but cases that where we've demonstrated
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
the value of that particular board so
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
that the legislature did commit to
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
specific action there whereas
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
they chose so far not to commit here but
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
your comments have been very helpful and
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your candor
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:17.190 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your candor
um

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
um
which

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
since not one of us including the former
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
judge sitting here
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
would believe that
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that we have
 
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.710 align:start position:0%
and that we have
a

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
full grasp on the complexities of what
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch is juggling right
 
00:55:32.799 --> 00:55:33.670 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch is juggling right
now

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
i guess if i could
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's not as if the court system is just
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
ticking along
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
smoothly at this you're doing great okay
 
00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.270 align:start position:0%
smoothly at this you're doing great okay
so

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
provided at some point in time a list of
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
if you have a half a million dollars of
 
00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:04.870 align:start position:0%
if you have a half a million dollars of
funding

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
as opposed to to fix the current
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
problems as opposed to
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
trying to create a brand new court
 
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:16.410 align:start position:0%
so so a fair question um
 
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.309 align:start position:0%
so so a fair question um
[Music]

00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
one i don't think we're creating a brand
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
new court we're creating a subgroup
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
within the existing court that would be
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
a particular docket similar to what we
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
have for commercial disputes
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
we do have in process more directly to
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
your question um a
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
a time study
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the national center of state courts
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
that data is expected to be uh complete
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
that report is expected to be completed
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
by mid-summer
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think that will also be helpful
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
certainly for the judicial branch in
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
identifying areas of priority
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
um and and would be i think constructive
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the legislative branch also
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i think some of from our perspective
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
we are waiting for
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
that data to come in in a final form so
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
that we can identify where there are
 
00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:09.670 align:start position:0%
that we can identify where there are
um

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
specific areas of of need
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
so i do think you know there is a a
 
00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:18.309 align:start position:0%
so i do think you know there is a a
larger

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
discussion that's going to be had in the
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
context of the budget where those
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
priorities are are going to be
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
identified and the i think the chief
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
justice will be
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
will be doing that work over the summer
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
with some of this data
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm only suggesting that one of those
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
areas i think of evaluation and
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
examination will be
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
land use appeals
 
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.390 align:start position:0%
land use appeals
and

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
i just want to follow up because i think
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
that that is the issue that i have with
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
this particular bill and that is
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're not handling our criminal cases in
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
the superior court with efficiency right
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
now we're backed up
 
00:57:55.359 --> 00:57:56.230 align:start position:0%
now we're backed up
and

00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
i might disagree a little bit with that
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
but well
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay look at the numbers you know i
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
think that's all you have to look at and
 
00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:04.789 align:start position:0%
think that's all you have to look at and
and

00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
i guess the reason is what are the
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
causal relationships there i mean
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
between the pandemic and the the
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
shortages in the uh public defenders
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
group um
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
right it
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's anybody's fault but the court
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
systems no i i and so
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying there's it's not just
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
the court system and not just resources
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
within the court system right but it
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
whether who whoever caused it whatever
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the cause might be it needs to be fixed
 
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
the cause might be it needs to be fixed
and

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
we got small claims cases
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
the constant complaints about small
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
claims cases not being hurt not being
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
timely heard
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
and and giving the lowest priority in
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
the system and so
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering you know if you're
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
going to focus funds are you going to
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
focus funds to fix
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
the current system you know let's so so
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and and you
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
know i throughout
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
this session in some last session i'm
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
relatively new in this position
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
i have identified especially in the
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
circuit court significant resource
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
limitations that the court has
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
both in terms of clerk's office staffing
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
and also judicial resources
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i say that in the context of
 
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.470 align:start position:0%
and i say that in the context of
legislation

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
that is adding to the burden of the
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
so as
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know additional legislation
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
gets added
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think the ripple effects also have to
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
be considered by the by the legislature
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
in a similar to the conversation we're
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
having about the land use docket once
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
you prioritize one thing
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
you are necessarily with a limited with
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
a fixed amount of resources going to
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
cause some other
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
ripple effect through the system so if
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
we for example
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
move something from superior court to
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
circuit court or we increase the number
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
of hearings on a particular area and
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
things that don't have statutory
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines or don't have constitutional
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
deadlines such as small claims
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
are inevitably going to be pushed
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
down stream
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
unless there are additional resources
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
put into the system
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that's absolutely true and
 
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
and that's absolutely true and
and

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i do think this time study is going
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
to help provide data on where
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
resource limitations that are causing
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
that type of of impact in terms of the
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
length of time cases are taken are being
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for uh
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
follow what representative smith
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned and that is we just recently
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
created the housing
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
appeals board
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the intent of that is
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
i think identical to what the intent of
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
this project this
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
suggestion for
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
docket is
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think we'd be uh better served
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
to just let the housing appeals board
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
work for another year or two
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
before we even
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
consider uh a docket in the courts
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
and the comp necess the complications
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
that come with that
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
so i would say we should just not pursue
 
01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:36.710 align:start position:0%
so i would say we should just not pursue
this

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh again thank you for the information
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
it helps us a lot to get that that kind
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
of information
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i hear what representative uh
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
welfare has said and i agree completely
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
but because of the information you've
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
given us and saying that there is a
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
study from an uh
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
quite a reputable external
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
group that where you expect to get the
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
results by
 
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.230 align:start position:0%
results by
mid-summer

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
mid-summer
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're hopeful in august uh then i wonder
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate for us to take
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
the same action here that we did on
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
the previous bill and not reach any
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
decision today understanding that it is
 
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.430 align:start position:0%
decision today understanding that it is
conceivable

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
conceivable
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
that when that report comes back in mid
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
august assuming that it's not
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
confidential and can be shared with um
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
with this body
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
just that piece of additional
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
information that could help us make a
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
better informed decision
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
when we act
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
i have no
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
particular objections or concerns about
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
about taking that approach either i
 
01:02:54.799 --> 01:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
about taking that approach either i
would

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
just add one other comment that
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know if if the recommendation is to
 
01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:03.589 align:start position:0%
you know if if the recommendation is to
not

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately whether today or be down the
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
road to not recommend further
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislation on this bill
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
i would have some concern if there were
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
legislation next session to
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
statutorily impose new deadlines on the
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
court without additional resources
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
similar to the conversation we've been
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
having so similar to what we saw in the
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill this session
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
you know essentially creating very tight
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
deadlines on court review of land use
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
dockets without relief such as this
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
creates the problems that we see
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
that that the chair was talking about
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
where okay something is going to get
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
pushed down downstream
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's the that's the sort of
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
balance in terms of of the
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation and i think the
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation then if it's a no further
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislation on this type would be i
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
would like the message i would hope
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
you know we have this new
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
docket through the other process through
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
the administrator process let that take
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
its course rather than starting to
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
impose narrow deadlines on the court
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
without additional resources
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative smith again thank you
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
i want to point out that
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
something that i alluded to earlier and
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
that is that we are about to that we are
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
well into the next budget cycle
 
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
well into the next budget cycle
and

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
one very
 
01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:32.309 align:start position:0%
one very
telling

01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
telling
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
piece of information would be if um
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
the court
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
is suggesting
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
to the governor
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
this particular docket
 
01:04:47.359 --> 01:04:49.270 align:start position:0%
this particular docket
uh

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.710 align:start position:0%
uh
rises

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
rises
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the top tier of importance and
 
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
to the top tier of importance and
therefore

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
we are asking for
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
x hundred thousand dollars in the budget
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
that would be starting um
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
not quite a year from now um
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
in july
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
first 2023
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
um to carry out such
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
purpose or perhaps as the chair has
 
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
purpose or perhaps as the chair has
indicated

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the court might
 
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.029 align:start position:0%
that the court might
wane

01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
wane
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of very difficult choices and we
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
understand that difficult choices might
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.029 align:start position:0%
in fact
indicate

01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
that if the port were to have access to
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
additional funds it would bother those
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
funds or who choose to have those funds
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
go to a b or c
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
an absent from that list might be
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
a land use
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
docket so that we have happening in the
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
next few months a number of activities
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
judicial branch submitting its budget
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
to governor
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
and the study committee coming back
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's this study group coming back in
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
august all of that would help inform
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
this committee as to what we might want
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
and something that we're
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
required to do by
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
november 1st is it
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
those that calendar makes it possible
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
again for us to have
 
01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:21.349 align:start position:0%
again for us to have
better

01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
information than we have today i think
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
those are all fair points thank you for
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
so were you making a motion that we not
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
move by representative smith second by
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
representing silvia that we make no
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation at this time
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.990 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
hand

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
next one is house bill 1435 relative to
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
the right of a victim of domestic
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
violence to have a support person
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
one thing i would point out is that i
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
understand the governor is
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
reconstituting the domestic violence
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
task force
 
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.870 align:start position:0%
task force
and

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:45.750 align:start position:0%
and it
we

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
might want to defer to them as to what
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
they believe the needs are
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to us making a specific
 
01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:01.109 align:start position:0%
as opposed to us making a specific
recommendation

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
mike uh representative sylvia
 
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.710 align:start position:0%
mike uh representative sylvia
so

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.910 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
briefly looked at the bill which is very
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
short in fact it's probably shorter than
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
problems that are
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
insurmountable in its current
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
propose

01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
propose
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
not recommending
 
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.749 align:start position:0%
not recommending
further

01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh let's
 
01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.269 align:start position:0%
uh let's
and

01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
see how the uh
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
task force uh
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that a motion
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is and is there a second to that
 
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
yes it is and is there a second to that
motion

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
recommend no further legislation
 
01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.910 align:start position:0%
recommend no further legislation
no

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.229 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
hand

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i think that was eight zero
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative langley
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 243
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
and if we were to take similar actions
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
to house bill 124 we might recommend
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
further legislation i don't know if
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to make that motion
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative smith moves
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
that we recommend further legislation
 
01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
that we recommend further legislation
and

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia seconds
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
of representative wolf i i suppose for
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
the benefit of representative langley
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
who wasn't here for the first discussion
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
she may want to just hear a few words
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative we actually have a
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative here from a group who is
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
working on proposed legislation and it's
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
the same group who came to testify at
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
our hearing
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
and explained all the problems with the
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
current bill
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
and they're working on coming up with a
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
proposal for legislation that would
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
that would work because the base i think
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
people believe that the basic idea was
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
good at just the way the legislation was
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
constructed it didn't work well for new
 
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.110 align:start position:0%
constructed it didn't work well for new
hampshire

01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
we've recommended the other bill which
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
is very similar for further legislation
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the proposal for this
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're extremely similar i think the
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
first three pages are identical it's
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
just the
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
page four was different but the other
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
hand are uncertainty about passing you
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
know one of them was not strictly
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion pending any
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
always in favor raise your hand
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
all those opposed originally
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
and finally senate bill 296 relative to
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
complaint procedures and cases before
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
the commission for human rights
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and representative mclean has indicated
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
that he would like to do a study
 
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:16.229 align:start position:0%
that he would like to do a study
committee

01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i think representative wolpers
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
indicated that he'd like to be on the
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
committee and representative simpson
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's representative smith
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
did was representative smith simpson no
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
just representative smith
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:46.630 align:start position:0%
 
mclean

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
mclean
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
any others
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
did represent simpsons indicate that she
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on the committee do you
 
01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:59.430 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on the committee do you
know

01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
well i can we can double check with her
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
all i can say is that
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
she told me no but she might have
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
changed her mind because okay you're
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to double check with
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
so are we in favor of having a study
 
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
so are we in favor of having a study
committee

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
i take it that means we're going to
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
postpone the decision today won't be any
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
decision today we'll just make a motion
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
to appoint i guess a motion to appoint a
 
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.390 align:start position:0%
to appoint i guess a motion to appoint a
committee

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.669 align:start position:0%
committee
and

01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
mr chairman my understanding i see you
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
have a calendar in front of you is that
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
um representative mclean has in fact put
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
a meeting of
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
a work group
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
optimistically he put in the calendar
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
a meeting of a work group for
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
next wednesday the 15th at 1 00 pm
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
and he he did that because he wanted to
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that as much notice as
 
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.470 align:start position:0%
make sure that as much notice as
possible

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
was given to the myriad people in the
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
community who would be interested in
 
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
community who would be interested in
helping

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
helping
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
shape the work
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
of this um
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
somebody like to make a motion that we
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
form a
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee or do we need to have a motion
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
i guess that we should
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative wilper so i move we
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
appoint a study committee
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
seconded by
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
i i would be happy the second uh just
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
 
01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.830 align:start position:0%
all those in favor please raise your
hand

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and mr chairman i
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
correct that um
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
in as the event has now taken place that
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
we have asked for such a study committee
 
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
we have asked for such a study committee
that

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
you had indicated that if such a
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee were to be formed that you
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
would ask representative mclean to chair
 
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.390 align:start position:0%
would ask representative mclean to chair
it

01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
it
yes

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
he i would direct him to chair of the
 
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
he i would direct him to chair of the
committee

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.149 align:start position:0%
committee
good

01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i will sort of i and i'll make an
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
effort to participate ex officials
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
well of course as a member of
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee i don't think it
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
has to be ex-official okay
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
any member of the judiciary committee is
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
free to
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
come it's just if there are poor people
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
all the sessions are public sessions
 
01:16:22.239 --> 01:16:23.189 align:start position:0%
all the sessions are public sessions
right

01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
and any member of the committee can
 
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.990 align:start position:0%
and any member of the committee can
certainly

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
attend but technically what
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know they don't have the status of
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
full subcommittee members although it
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
would be really good for us to have
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
another one
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay i think
 
01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.390 align:start position:0%
okay i think
that

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
concludes our
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
is there any other business we need to
 
01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
is there any other business we need to
address

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
i know just like to note that all our
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
votes were unanimous
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
today that's much appreciated it's a
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then mr chair as a full committee
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have only one
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we've established
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
whatever you would call it for a group
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
but that the full
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
would meet then sometime in the fall in
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
order to confirm
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
or to vote on
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
our suggestions
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
that we made today plus suggestion
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
coming from the one subcommittee yep
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we discussed earlier on and
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's the intent
 
01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:09.430 align:start position:0%
i think that's the intent
right

01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
