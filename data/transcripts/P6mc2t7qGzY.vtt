our staff person who's helping with
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
technology to try and reach out to her
 
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:06.830 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if her cell phone number

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:25.490 align:start position:0%
okay so until representative like this
 
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.060 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:50.019 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:53.779 align:start position:0%
asking for which which followed up on
 
00:15:57.699 --> 00:15:57.709 align:start position:0%
the gel car final objection to education
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:05.850 align:start position:0%
that final objection which was entered
 
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:10.610 align:start position:0%
by gel car on October 17th of 2019
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
followed a series of conversations that
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
and presentations that gel car received
 
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:19.550 align:start position:0%
on Board of Education rules
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
1,400 the findings which are became part
 
00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:30.329 align:start position:0%
of the Senate joint resolution include
 
00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:36.329 align:start position:0%
that the education rules 1,400 were
 
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:38.930 align:start position:0%
contrary to the Legislature's intent
 
00:16:43.699 --> 00:16:43.709 align:start position:0%
when the legislature adopted RSA 193 e
 
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.050 align:start position:0%
to a 5 roman 5 a and that it was
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
contrary to the general statutory
 
00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:03.089 align:start position:0%
purpose clause in RSA 193 II 1 and 2 so
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully you're familiar with the
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum rules that are a part of 193
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
E the contrary to legislative intent was
 
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:25.770 align:start position:0%
cited in a couple of different ways in
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
the gel car report and the contrary to
 
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:35.780 align:start position:0%
the overall general purpose clause of
 
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:41.850 align:start position:0%
193 E was also cited in the gel car
 
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:47.370 align:start position:0%
report and it violates the general
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
purpose clause because the statute
 
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
delegates to school districts the
 
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:56.390 align:start position:0%
responsibility for specific curriculum
 
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.230 align:start position:0%
for which credit is granted so this was
 
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:15.390 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
to use that as a means to grant to the
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education the authority
 
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.170 align:start position:0%
to grant up to one-third of all credit
 
00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:30.809 align:start position:0%
towards a student's graduation but a gel
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
car found in its final objection that
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is that that 5b section does not
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
give the board authority to require a
 
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:43.710 align:start position:0%
school district to grant credit for
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
programs or courses when the school
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
district itself did not approve the
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum so the final objection asked
 
00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:03.809 align:start position:0%
that the General Court undertake a
 
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:08.970 align:start position:0%
resolution and that was done on February
 
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:11.630 align:start position:0%
6th introduced by and passed by the
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
Senate that prohibits the Board of
 
00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:18.809 align:start position:0%
Education from adopting and 1400 which
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
is embodied here in this Senate joint
 
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.250 align:start position:0%
resolution 1 and this resolution says
 
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.020 align:start position:0%
that the legislature shall consider
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
altering 193 e to a 5 B D so that it is
 
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:51.510 align:start position:0%
clear in its intent on what authority
 
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
that Clause gives to the Board of
 
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:57.890 align:start position:0%
Education and I I'd say that the
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
legislature both in the house and the
 
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:06.380 align:start position:0%
Senate have introduced legislation to
 
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:09.290 align:start position:0%
follow through on this joint resolution
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
the house did so through representative
 
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.110 align:start position:0%
Tanner's House bill 14:54 and in the
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
Senate through senator Diaz bill which
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
you will hear shortly
 
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.030 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 514 so with that
 
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.970 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 514 so with that

deli

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:57.530 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman Thank You senator
 
00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:02.049 align:start position:0%
for being here wherever here is
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
questioning that I think you were
 
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:08.540 align:start position:0%
relating credits to curriculum of the
 
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:15.049 align:start position:0%
school but isn't it in statute and rules
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
that credits are based on competencies
 
00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:27.809 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:31.940 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question no I that the
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
statutes are very clear that it is the
 
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.130 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school district to
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
establish how credits are earned many
 
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.410 align:start position:0%
credits can be earned in a variety of
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
different ways they make me earn through
 
00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:55.350 align:start position:0%
internship or work based learning or so
 
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.130 align:start position:0%
we those are specified in the statute
 
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:06.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
either by raising your hand on as a as a
 
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:11.950 align:start position:0%
panelist or if you want to get my
 
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.090 align:start position:0%
attention go like that to seeing none
 
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:19.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much senator Kahn Oh
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
represent of lad was that a hand raised
 
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:28.030 align:start position:0%
it was sort of a pass through the screen
 
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:31.850 align:start position:0%
but I've always had a problem with the
 
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:39.470 align:start position:0%
how the folks on gel car are responding
 
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:44.270 align:start position:0%
to what they think is the intent of this
 
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:47.390 align:start position:0%
legislation or are the learning
 
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:50.330 align:start position:0%
everywhere everywhere program according
 
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:52.490 align:start position:0%
to statute and if we're looking at the
 
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:55.700 align:start position:0%
same sections that Senator Kahn is
 
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.490 align:start position:0%
referencing five a and B 5 B has a
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
statement which I'd like to have senator
 
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.300 align:start position:0%
Kahn respond to please says the State
 
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
Board of Education shall adopt rules
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 541 a and those rules are
 
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.020 align:start position:0%
approved by gel car and they were
 
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:21.350 align:start position:0%
relative to the approval of alternate
 
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.140 align:start position:0%
programs for granting credit leading to
 
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:27.500 align:start position:0%
graduation so it gives am i right in
 
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.100 align:start position:0%
saying that the State Board has
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
determine alternate programs that lead
 
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:41.740 align:start position:0%
to graduation by awarding credit so Rick
 
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:44.180 align:start position:0%
represent lat
 
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:46.250 align:start position:0%
my understanding is we've got the chair
 
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:50.570 align:start position:0%
of JL Karp coming up next that anything
 
00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:53.390 align:start position:0%
related to 541 aim might be better
 
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.410 align:start position:0%
directed to the chair of JL car also
 
00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.370 align:start position:0%
representative Hatch's from the north
 
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:01.460 align:start position:0%
country okay wait I don't the heels here
 
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:07.970 align:start position:0%
yeah is that okay with you senator we
 
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:13.970 align:start position:0%
can but but I'm happy to let you respond
 
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.170 align:start position:0%
to that though yeah and if you let me
 
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.610 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
well it's it so to make clear what 5b
 
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:39.500 align:start position:0%
does is it says pursuant to issuing
 
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:43.970 align:start position:0%
rules relative to approval of alternate
 
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:47.630 align:start position:0%
programs it doesn't say that the Board
 
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
of Education shall have the authority to
 
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:55.700 align:start position:0%
grant credit towards graduation it's
 
00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:58.910 align:start position:0%
that it will develop rules for
 
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:04.370 align:start position:0%
alternative programs and the clause
 
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:06.470 align:start position:0%
that's just before it just can't be
 
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.220 align:start position:0%
ignored it's it makes it very clear that
 
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:18.680 align:start position:0%
it is the responsibility of a school
 
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:22.490 align:start position:0%
board its teachers and administrators to
 
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:26.810 align:start position:0%
identify the best way for students to
 
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:28.460 align:start position:0%
acquire the knowledge skills in
 
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
curriculum essentially what what
 
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.110 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell II was
 
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:35.420 align:start position:0%
identifying earlier so there was a
 
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:38.750 align:start position:0%
pretty clear distinction established
 
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.170 align:start position:0%
within the same section just different
 
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:48.530 align:start position:0%
subsections III just didn't we did not
 
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
see how it could be controverted either
 
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.090 align:start position:0%
through the general purpose clause of
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
193 e2a
 
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.030 align:start position:0%
or through the section that as a whole a
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
and B both are are defining let me also
 
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:15.890 align:start position:0%
say that this is this action here is a
 
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.180 align:start position:0%
little bit odd in its you know a lot of
 
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
hatch talk to you about the timing on
 
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:26.300 align:start position:0%
this but I think the action by the House
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
Education Committee is needing to be
 
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.130 align:start position:0%
completed within this month by June 26th
 
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:37.610 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with the guidelines
 
00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:43.460 align:start position:0%
established in 541 a and 541 a is very
 
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:47.500 align:start position:0%
we're as to how it defines the
 
00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:53.289 align:start position:0%
establishing of rules and and these
 
00:26:56.139 --> 00:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
violating legislative intent or or
 
00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.130 align:start position:0%
exceeding legislative intent I should
 
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:09.700 align:start position:0%
say and the contrary to general purpose
 
00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:11.779 align:start position:0%
statements these are these are very
 
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:17.950 align:start position:0%
clear within the guidelines of 541 eight
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
all right mr. chairman seeing no more
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions for the
 
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
center we've got we've got a hand raised
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
from sin from represent cordially Thank
 
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
You mr. chairman
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
and Hughes senator in the resolution
 
00:27:43.899 --> 00:27:43.909 align:start position:0%
just looking at the bottom of the first
 
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:50.210 align:start position:0%
page where looks like you're doing two
 
00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:53.539 align:start position:0%
things in this resolution you're
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the State Board of Education
 
00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:01.789 align:start position:0%
from taking action and also putting a
 
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:04.730 align:start position:0%
mandate on the general court general
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
is really that the purpose of this
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
resolution and I had thought that
 
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
resolutions had a different purpose
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
other than requiring an action of this
 
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:31.750 align:start position:0%
type it is a requirement in 541 a if
 
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:38.170 align:start position:0%
when entering a final objection that the
 
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
legislature also remedy that the the
 
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.050 align:start position:0%
reasons for it and that is what's being
 
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:49.540 align:start position:0%
done here thank you very much senator
 
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.050 align:start position:0%
con see no further questions thank you
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
very much for your time oh I'm sorry
 
00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:58.810 align:start position:0%
there's no there's a hand up from
 
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:02.020 align:start position:0%
represent of Eliot yes I'm reading the
 
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:06.670 align:start position:0%
last paragraph of the bill itself right
 
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:11.020 align:start position:0%
and it says that Senator to you I want
 
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:13.390 align:start position:0%
some clarification here and I'm gonna
 
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:17.410 align:start position:0%
add the word state when I use the word
 
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
board as opposed to the local board
 
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.350 align:start position:0%
because I feel that this gives more
 
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.140 align:start position:0%
authority to the local board and less
 
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.210 align:start position:0%
authority to the State Board of
 
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:31.270 align:start position:0%
Education so it goes like this that the
 
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:37.410 align:start position:0%
general Court shall clarify RSA 193 II
 
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:43.530 align:start position:0%
by legislation that one the rulemaking
 
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.270 align:start position:0%
authority of the State Board of
 
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:54.220 align:start position:0%
Education in RSA 193 e to a V B does or
 
00:29:59.370 --> 00:29:59.380 align:start position:0%
does not give the State Board authority
 
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
to require that school districts grant
 
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.090 align:start position:0%
credit for courses or programs when the
 
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.950 align:start position:0%
credit for courses or programs when the
district

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:12.409 align:start position:0%
did not itself approve the curriculum
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
and two that RSA 93 e to a V B therefore
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
does or does not authorize the State
 
00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:30.049 align:start position:0%
Board to require a school local district
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
board to accept the credit if it chooses
 
00:30:38.409 --> 00:30:38.419 align:start position:0%
not to would you explain that to me does
 
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.230 align:start position:0%
it or does it not authorize the board do
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
you have the bill in front of you
 
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:48.730 align:start position:0%
senator I do and a glad to explain that
 
00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:53.149 align:start position:0%
during the gel car hearings and the
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
final objection it was a request that
 
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
the legislature affirm one way or the
 
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:06.500 align:start position:0%
other whether the State Board has this
 
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.110 align:start position:0%
Authority or not that's why I made
 
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.570 align:start position:0%
reference to the two bills that have
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
passed from the house to the senator
 
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.230 align:start position:0%
from the Senate to the house that both
 
00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:24.789 align:start position:0%
are trying to clarify that authority
 
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:27.230 align:start position:0%
well what do you think does it doesn't
 
00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
mean further question whether question
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
mr. chair inquire thank you briefly very
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
briefly in your opinion does it or does
 
00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:45.289 align:start position:0%
it not give the authority to the school
 
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.110 align:start position:0%
district to make the final decision is
 
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:50.630 align:start position:0%
this a local control bill or not you
 
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:52.490 align:start position:0%
know what I'm gonna I'm gonna take that
 
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:54.950 align:start position:0%
one represented Elliott what this does
 
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:57.380 align:start position:0%
is is directs the general court to
 
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:01.190 align:start position:0%
consider a legislation to clarify the
 
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.110 align:start position:0%
intent the next bill we're gonna hear
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
about is is a version of that of that
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
clarity so you may want to look for that
 
00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:14.059 align:start position:0%
in in Senate bill 514 okay okay yeah we

this issue I'm representative William
 
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.500 align:start position:0%
this issue I'm representative William
hatch

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:47.510 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:51.049 align:start position:0%
I represent 15 communities in
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
unincorporated areas including the
 
00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:57.700 align:start position:0%
beautiful town of Gorham and Shelburne I
 
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:00.770 align:start position:0%
also served on Finance as vice chair of
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
division 1 and in the past I've served
 
00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
on ways and means as vice-chair I'm
 
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:10.850 align:start position:0%
currently chair of gel car which I see
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
some of the members there had served on
 
00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:14.419 align:start position:0%
gel car like representative land and are
 
00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:17.149 align:start position:0%
familiar with it but I find most people
 
00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:20.629 align:start position:0%
really do not fully understand the role
 
00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:23.149 align:start position:0%
of gel car in what it does and doesn't
 
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:26.060 align:start position:0%
do and I was just asked to speak to this
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
and and what I will do is I'll just
 
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:32.540 align:start position:0%
briefly describe what gel car is my
 
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:33.980 align:start position:0%
understanding of the parameters that
 
00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:36.589 align:start position:0%
were thunder and
 
00:34:39.819 --> 00:34:39.829 align:start position:0%
why were there what I will not do is I
 
00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:42.589 align:start position:0%
will not discuss the policy and that's
 
00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:44.809 align:start position:0%
not what we do in gel car it's not a
 
00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:47.419 align:start position:0%
policy committee in fact it's rather
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
unique it consists of five members of
 
00:34:53.769 --> 00:34:53.779 align:start position:0%
the Senate and five individuals from the
 
00:34:55.899 --> 00:34:55.909 align:start position:0%
house and that comprises the committee
 
00:34:59.650 --> 00:34:59.660 align:start position:0%
of gel car and its purpose is is to
 
00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:02.569 align:start position:0%
review a minute straight-up rules
 
00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:05.269 align:start position:0%
submitted by other departments or
 
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:08.180 align:start position:0%
agencies throughout the state and the
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
primary function is to assure that those
 
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:14.660 align:start position:0%
rules promulgated by the different
 
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:18.710 align:start position:0%
entities do follow under statute and do
 
00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
follow legislative intent through those
 
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:26.180 align:start position:0%
statutes how that's done is it's an
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
arduous task we have three to four
 
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
attorneys as part of gel car very
 
00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:33.349 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals if you're
 
00:35:35.979 --> 00:35:35.989 align:start position:0%
experienced in very thorough and and I
 
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:38.930 align:start position:0%
need to stress that I'm always amazed as
 
00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:42.049 align:start position:0%
to how thorough the gel car staff is in
 
00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:45.950 align:start position:0%
going through these rules in the submit
 
00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:49.069 align:start position:0%
very lengthy reports a lot of reading as
 
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:53.390 align:start position:0%
to and and they speak to whether or not
 
00:35:56.769 --> 00:35:56.779 align:start position:0%
these rules comply where they don't
 
00:35:59.319 --> 00:35:59.329 align:start position:0%
comply where they may or may not need
 
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:02.390 align:start position:0%
improvement and as a committee we get
 
00:36:05.049 --> 00:36:05.059 align:start position:0%
those reports from the staff attorneys
 
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:08.420 align:start position:0%
attorneys we review them during our gel
 
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:11.630 align:start position:0%
card meetings and then we dispel we vote
 
00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:16.009 align:start position:0%
on two positive actions and some of
 
00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:18.109 align:start position:0%
those the positive actions are is we
 
00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:20.569 align:start position:0%
could vote to accept the rule as
 
00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:23.589 align:start position:0%
submitted and that's the most common one
 
00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:26.569 align:start position:0%
we can review the rules and either from
 
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:29.930 align:start position:0%
attorney notes or our own experiences we
 
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:34.660 align:start position:0%
can grant a conditional approval to the
 
00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:36.950 align:start position:0%
agency and we might have some
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
prerequisites before those rules are
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:41.450 align:start position:0%
incorporated we might have some added
 
00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:43.579 align:start position:0%
items we might have some edited items
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
but again under 541 a it's very exhaust
 
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
in we had to stay in very close
 
00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
parameters for these different positive
 
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:02.930 align:start position:0%
actions and through the years in gel car
 
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:06.050 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure reckoning recalling a
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative lab we hit them all and
 
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:12.740 align:start position:0%
and nothing's done lightly yet I should
 
00:37:16.329 --> 00:37:16.339 align:start position:0%
say then the other part of the
 
00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:18.619 align:start position:0%
dispositive action we can do is we could
 
00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:21.500 align:start position:0%
have a preliminary objection to the rule
 
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.410 align:start position:0%
we can state why we object to the rule
 
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:27.830 align:start position:0%
and on a preliminary objection the rule
 
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
goes back to the agency to either fix
 
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:34.700 align:start position:0%
address or renegotiate why the committee
 
00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:37.099 align:start position:0%
objects to the rule and they have 90
 
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:39.380 align:start position:0%
days to bring it back to the committee I
 
00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:44.089 align:start position:0%
believe it's 90 with its editing or
 
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:47.690 align:start position:0%
Corrections or changes to comply with
 
00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:50.900 align:start position:0%
the committee's request and really the
 
00:37:53.079 --> 00:37:53.089 align:start position:0%
committee's request we're very careful
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
about it are always based on 541 a and
 
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:00.710 align:start position:0%
statute then there's a final objection
 
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:03.500 align:start position:0%
saying in some cases and this is what
 
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:07.940 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with now with the 1400
 
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:12.220 align:start position:0%
rules the committee has a final
 
00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:15.349 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection and then a final
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
objection in the agency doesn't see the
 
00:38:22.329 --> 00:38:22.339 align:start position:0%
necessity to edit those rules to comply
 
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:26.570 align:start position:0%
with 541 a and and again I I have to say
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
that gel car is doesn't take actions in
 
00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:34.849 align:start position:0%
my experience unless there's very strong
 
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:37.970 align:start position:0%
footing and very strong statute
 
00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:40.339 align:start position:0%
authority to do so and that's again one
 
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:43.580 align:start position:0%
of the primary functions of gel cars to
 
00:38:45.579 --> 00:38:45.589 align:start position:0%
assure that there's statutory authority
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
to take whatever actions the agency want
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
to takes wants to take through rules and
 
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:53.810 align:start position:0%
actually whatever actions gel car takes
 
00:38:59.099 --> 00:38:59.109 align:start position:0%
we follow 5:1 541 a very closely there's
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
four areas for objections I
 
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:06.990 align:start position:0%
for dispositive actions and and one of
 
00:39:10.819 --> 00:39:10.829 align:start position:0%
them is it's very important it's looked
 
00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:15.270 align:start position:0%
at if we've met legend if the rules that
 
00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
are being submitted meet legislative
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
intent in other words does it does it
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
follow what's in the statute and does it
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
conform with the statute we also look at
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact rule named fall statute in
 
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:39.390 align:start position:0%
terms of intent but it's filed through
 
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:42.270 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes because they do get fiscal
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
notes the patiska limp act of these
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
rules as submitted is concerning our
 
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:51.930 align:start position:0%
public interest does it meet public
 
00:39:54.769 --> 00:39:54.779 align:start position:0%
interest that's another area where there
 
00:39:59.029 --> 00:39:59.039 align:start position:0%
could be objection to the rule submitted
 
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:03.690 align:start position:0%
so I think I think I hit him and then
 
00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:08.609 align:start position:0%
then what's happened with this rule it
 
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:10.890 align:start position:0%
was determined that it did not meet
 
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:15.770 align:start position:0%
legislative intent Jenny spoke to that
 
00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:20.819 align:start position:0%
briefly but there's there are certain
 
00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
things that were for an example in this
 
00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:27.869 align:start position:0%
rule that were just it's explicit in the
 
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:30.690 align:start position:0%
statute as to why the action the Board
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
of Education wanted to take was not
 
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:36.750 align:start position:0%
authorized under statutes and it was
 
00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
very clear from our staff attorneys and
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
jail card and that's what moved the
 
00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:47.329 align:start position:0%
committee to have the final objection so
 
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:50.849 align:start position:0%
when that happens and there's still an
 
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:54.380 align:start position:0%
unyielding by the agency or the State
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
Department to conform the rules to what
 
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:01.890 align:start position:0%
we believe statute states they should we
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
come up to the joint resolution which
 
00:41:08.059 --> 00:41:08.069 align:start position:0%
stops those rules from going forward as
 
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:10.460 align:start position:0%
submitted for a period of time
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
everything we do in gel car is on a time
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
clock so to speak raaaah
 
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:17.650 align:start position:0%
and it starts me
 
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:19.990 align:start position:0%
once we vote on those actions to be
 
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:23.950 align:start position:0%
taken and and here we are now with the
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
joint resolution it's gone through the
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
Senate into that house and just as a
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
brief historical review since 76 are
 
00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:41.770 align:start position:0%
thereof or 96 maybe yeah sorry
 
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.010 align:start position:0%
since 1996 on your gel car there's been
 
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:47.980 align:start position:0%
up constantly 5,000 rules are reviewed
 
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:52.450 align:start position:0%
by the committee and out of those 5,000
 
00:41:55.289 --> 00:41:55.299 align:start position:0%
rules there's been only 20 joint
 
00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.170 align:start position:0%
resolutions found necessary I I've been
 
00:42:03.059 --> 00:42:03.069 align:start position:0%
on gel car for not sure how long more
 
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:07.630 align:start position:0%
than a decade anyways plus and the my
 
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:09.460 align:start position:0%
experience who has been has been only
 
00:42:13.049 --> 00:42:13.059 align:start position:0%
one other joint resolution so out of
 
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:16.650 align:start position:0%
those 20 joint resolutions
 
00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:19.089 align:start position:0%
three-quarters of them or 15 of them
 
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:22.690 align:start position:0%
once it was voted on by the committee to
 
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:26.410 align:start position:0%
take making joint resolution the agency
 
00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:29.349 align:start position:0%
or the department with jewelr rules as
 
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:33.670 align:start position:0%
submitted so what that caused is no
 
00:42:36.269 --> 00:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
further action needed to be taken the
 
00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:38.380 align:start position:0%
resolutions did not have to be presented
 
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:42.510 align:start position:0%
to both houses the issue is resolved
 
00:42:47.609 --> 00:42:47.619 align:start position:0%
five of them did go forward and three of
 
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:50.710 align:start position:0%
them went the full course up to the
 
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:52.510 align:start position:0%
governor's desk then signed and put into
 
00:42:56.819 --> 00:42:56.829 align:start position:0%
action and again why I'm just getting a
 
00:42:58.890 --> 00:42:58.900 align:start position:0%
little historical review of joint
 
00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:01.869 align:start position:0%
resolutions this is not an action taken
 
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:04.710 align:start position:0%
lightly this is not an action that
 
00:43:08.339 --> 00:43:08.349 align:start position:0%
anybody really prefers to do but
 
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:10.750 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the importance of it it's
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.519 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the importance of it it's
paramount

00:43:11.519 --> 00:43:11.529 align:start position:0%
paramount
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
I think and that's why we're taking this
 
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:17.380 align:start position:0%
action now just just to put things maybe
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
in perspective a little bit gel car a
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan body and as I stated our
 
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
purpose is to assure the things can
 
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:34.300 align:start position:0%
with legislative intent things conform
 
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:37.180 align:start position:0%
with the statute in my years on gel car
 
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:39.940 align:start position:0%
I could not even guess how many times I
 
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:42.670 align:start position:0%
voted in favor of a rule I submitted
 
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:46.300 align:start position:0%
that I was was so against the policy
 
00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:48.369 align:start position:0%
that it was speaking to I was so against
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
the action that was taken but it did
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
follow legislative intent and it did
 
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:56.290 align:start position:0%
fill the purpose that we as a
 
00:43:58.830 --> 00:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body voted to take forward
 
00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:03.940 align:start position:0%
in the majority so that's that's why it
 
00:44:05.099 --> 00:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
is what it is
 
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.170 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have to take sometimes
 
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:09.820 align:start position:0%
these actions and and I think that's why
 
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:13.660 align:start position:0%
it's very important we really need to be
 
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:18.310 align:start position:0%
careful about allowing any M&amp;P within
 
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:22.300 align:start position:0%
state government to take actions without
 
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:24.670 align:start position:0%
the proper to authority and some I heard
 
00:44:26.849 --> 00:44:26.859 align:start position:0%
a couple members of this committee read
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
a couple things that seeing what the
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
board of education was doing was
 
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:38.590 align:start position:0%
appropriate but just these things have
 
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:40.300 align:start position:0%
been looked at they looked and looked at
 
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:43.150 align:start position:0%
by staff eternity attorneys and please
 
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:47.770 align:start position:0%
know there's been times that some of
 
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:49.060 align:start position:0%
these things were taken to the Supreme
 
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.030 align:start position:0%
Court and adjudicated and what was what
 
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:56.590 align:start position:0%
the finding was when a item is taken out
 
00:44:59.340 --> 00:44:59.350 align:start position:0%
of context and that's what some of these
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
they believe that some of these
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
statements are they were being utilized
 
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:05.980 align:start position:0%
as Authority that they were taking the
 
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:08.470 align:start position:0%
statue or the phrase out of context and
 
00:45:10.859 --> 00:45:10.869 align:start position:0%
utilizing that to say that they had the
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
authority to do what they were doing and
 
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:16.450 align:start position:0%
and they don't actually so anyways with
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
that I think the chairs thank the
 
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.010 align:start position:0%
committee for listening and and I will
 
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:25.390 align:start position:0%
entertain a question or so only on what
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
Dzhokhar dozen doesn't do I will not
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
entertain question on policy and I will
 
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.230 align:start position:0%
not debate statute with that thank you
 
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:37.180 align:start position:0%
mr. chair and thank you very much
 
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:40.420 align:start position:0%
chairman hatch questions for for
 
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:43.210 align:start position:0%
represented hatch I see a representative
 
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:46.089 align:start position:0%
cordeliers ass and up go ahead
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
question representative thank you for
 
00:45:59.730 --> 00:45:59.740 align:start position:0%
being here I was looking at walk back up
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that a joint resolution
 
00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:08.109 align:start position:0%
prohibits actions for a period of time
 
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:13.690 align:start position:0%
and I also checked with the house clerk
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
who said that that what deadlines
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
without deadlines there would not be any
 
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:30.710 align:start position:0%
action taking taking place I don't see
 
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:34.490 align:start position:0%
any period of time within this joint
 
00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:38.329 align:start position:0%
resolution would you explain that I'm
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand your question the
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
the curated time doesn't have to be with
 
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:45.170 align:start position:0%
them joint resolution the period times
 
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.010 align:start position:0%
are dictated by 541 a all right so we
 
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:51.260 align:start position:0%
have just like anything or most things
 
00:46:54.819 --> 00:46:54.829 align:start position:0%
within the legislature and I think I
 
00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:57.230 align:start position:0%
stated in explaining what gel cart does
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
everything we do once we start ADA
 
00:47:02.859 --> 00:47:02.869 align:start position:0%
positive dispositive action we're on a
 
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:07.250 align:start position:0%
clock an agency's on the clock so for
 
00:47:10.359 --> 00:47:10.369 align:start position:0%
example for this joint resolution under
 
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:15.550 align:start position:0%
the current clock unless I as chair and
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
granted a waiver for that clock has to
 
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:21.170 align:start position:0%
be disposed of through legislative
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
action by the 26th of June per se now
 
00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:29.089 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know that I understand
 
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.250 align:start position:0%
stood your quick didn't exactly or not
 
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:33.380 align:start position:0%
but that's what I'm when I'm speaking to
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
the plot timeframe that's what I'm
 
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.050 align:start position:0%
speaking to or observed cordially your
 
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:44.710 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you go on to the
 
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:50.750 align:start position:0%
next part of the resolution you talked
 
00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:52.579 align:start position:0%
about joint resolutions I think
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative and a little background
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
on them I
 
00:47:59.260 --> 00:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
was struck by the fact that this
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
resolution requires the general court to
 
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:08.630 align:start position:0%
take certain action how many times have
 
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:11.660 align:start position:0%
there been joint resolutions requiring
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
an action by the general court
 
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:16.940 align:start position:0%
I have no absolutely no idea and I don't
 
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
even know if that question is germane to
 
00:48:21.849 --> 00:48:21.859 align:start position:0%
the action we've taken a resolution can
 
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.010 align:start position:0%
particularly from Dzhokhar the joint
 
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:26.630 align:start position:0%
resolutions are a little different than
 
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:31.790 align:start position:0%
what we normally used to they're there
 
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:37.310 align:start position:0%
for very serious actions to be taken by
 
00:48:39.819 --> 00:48:39.829 align:start position:0%
the general court it's not just stating
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
our displeasure with something or
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
pleasure with something like many joint
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
resolutions may do that is put into
 
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:53.380 align:start position:0%
place for a deposit of action and it is
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
definitive so thank you are the is this
 
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:03.140 align:start position:0%
a follow-up purpose out of core delhi or
 
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:05.060 align:start position:0%
is this a new question
 
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:08.660 align:start position:0%
a new question just I just want to check
 
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:12.230 align:start position:0%
to see if anybody else has a further
 
00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:16.790 align:start position:0%
question to ask all right seeing none
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
represented cordially thank you thank
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
you mr. chairman representative from
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
what I read one of the gel cards actions
 
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:33.910 align:start position:0%
was that it was your basis for
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that statute
 
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:41.410 align:start position:0%
delegates responsibility to districts
 
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:45.380 align:start position:0%
for curriculum for which grant credit is
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
granted but I saw in the Department of
 
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:53.690 align:start position:0%
Education response and I believe it to
 
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:01.460 align:start position:0%
be true that there is nowhere in statute
 
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:04.430 align:start position:0%
or rules that a student is required to
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
correct to complete specific curriculum
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
in order to receive credit
 
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
and in reality credits are based on
 
00:50:20.339 --> 00:50:20.349 align:start position:0%
competencies not auricular so I'm not
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
sure how you determined what the intent
 
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:30.070 align:start position:0%
of the the rules were that you were
 
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:35.290 align:start position:0%
objecting to just I I think I I may have
 
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
mentioned that particularly in this set
 
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:41.500 align:start position:0%
of rules of 1400 as submitted by the
 
00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:43.630 align:start position:0%
agencies and the authorizations that
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
they utilized for these rules they cited
 
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:51.570 align:start position:0%
different things on a statue
 
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:56.740 align:start position:0%
individually as opposed to that statue
 
00:50:59.490 --> 00:50:59.500 align:start position:0%
as a whole and that's what I meant by
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
taking it out of context and and again
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to debate our essays or
 
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:09.820 align:start position:0%
the meaning of them we have three and
 
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.180 align:start position:0%
four very capable staff attorneys on gel
 
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:15.730 align:start position:0%
card that we rely on heavily not that
 
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.010 align:start position:0%
everything they submit to us is accepted
 
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:20.770 align:start position:0%
by us as a committee but we rely on them
 
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:25.180 align:start position:0%
heavily and and they are incredibly and
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
I can't say this enough because I say it
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
often they are incredibly thorough and
 
00:51:34.079 --> 00:51:34.089 align:start position:0%
that has been adjudicated by the
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm not going to debate it
 
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:38.170 align:start position:0%
but that's where we are
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:51:44.099 --> 00:51:44.109 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd
 
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:49.390 align:start position:0%
I got three more minutes my bride just
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
came in the upstairs this may be the
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
last question for okay I thought it was
 
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:56.410 align:start position:0%
pretty cold out there in North Country
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
there it was I still see white Rick when
 
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
I look out my back window so I got fired
 
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:06.970 align:start position:0%
the fireplace right beside me okay I've
 
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
looked through 193 E and I can make the
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
real pretty solid an assumption that it
 
00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:19.210 align:start position:0%
is statutory intent that all students
 
00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:21.220 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity for an adequate
 
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:23.500 align:start position:0%
education agreed
 
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:25.570 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm not even gonna speak to that
 
00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:28.150 align:start position:0%
Rick okay oh then I could I'm not even
 
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:28.900 align:start position:0%
gonna go there
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
let me follow that up then I'm looking
 
00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:33.940 align:start position:0%
at another portion of statute it says
 
00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:36.550 align:start position:0%
competency-based strategies provide
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the way that credit can
 
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:40.810 align:start position:0%
be earned in a way that's that's not
 
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:45.550 align:start position:0%
even right what's nice is why why was
 
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:48.910 align:start position:0%
gel car in the position where they're
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
striking down another alternate pathway
 
00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
offline online be it whatever it might
 
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:00.570 align:start position:0%
be community-based where a student can
 
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:03.790 align:start position:0%
achieve these competencies through the
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program why was that
 
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.010 align:start position:0%
struck down because it's to me it's in
 
00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.170 align:start position:0%
mind with the intent of those several
 
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:18.220 align:start position:0%
areas I'll just I'll just say this for
 
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:19.930 align:start position:0%
the entire committee if I may into that
 
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:21.990 align:start position:0%
question go to the gel car website
 
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:25.420 align:start position:0%
everything's very clear there and Rick
 
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:27.940 align:start position:0%
with you your abilities it probably will
 
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:30.250 align:start position:0%
take you about five minutes to read the
 
00:53:33.089 --> 00:53:33.099 align:start position:0%
notes off that the answer the question
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
you just asked me Thank You mr. chair
 
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:36.910 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.030 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:42.910 align:start position:0%
very much chairman hatch for for being
 
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:43.990 align:start position:0%
with us this afternoon
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. K I hope I was helpful and
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's good seeing a lot of you guys stay
 
00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:50.109 align:start position:0%
warm up north
 
00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:56.670 align:start position:0%
yeah next I would like to to recognize
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioner L blue who is offering to
 
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:09.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:11.330 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm on video but I'm not sure
 
00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:13.700 align:start position:0%
if I'm gonna be promoted on the football
 
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:15.020 align:start position:0%
month phone but am I going to promote it
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
on video too because I don't want to
 
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
give you guys parallel processing here
 
00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:19.820 align:start position:0%
you've certainly been promoted as a
 
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:21.890 align:start position:0%
panelist so I don't know great we will
 
00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:23.780 align:start position:0%
go ahead and I don't see myself jump on
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
screen so I'm going to go ahead and get
 
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:27.260 align:start position:0%
started then in terms of the testimony
 
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record Frank a tableau
 
00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education and appreciate
 
00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:34.940 align:start position:0%
that you all have joined us by video
 
00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:38.150 align:start position:0%
today and are addressing these important
 
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:42.530 align:start position:0%
matters by way of comments I've got
 
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:43.820 align:start position:0%
another meeting that I need to be at I
 
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.010 align:start position:0%
know you have deep our Senate joint
 
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
resolution one but then you'll be
 
00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.090 align:start position:0%
hearing SB five one four I have
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony to you on both of
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
those both on sjr one as well as SB five
 
00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:58.580 align:start position:0%
one four to encourage you to take a look
 
00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:02.300 align:start position:0%
at those because this is the sjr hearing
 
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:04.610 align:start position:0%
I will limit my comments principally not
 
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:08.380 align:start position:0%
to policy but to the gel car process
 
00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:12.350 align:start position:0%
would encourage you as well to read the
 
00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:15.110 align:start position:0%
many pages of information that I have
 
00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:17.780 align:start position:0%
provided to gel car as well as to this
 
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:22.940 align:start position:0%
committee in response to the gel car
 
00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:25.580 align:start position:0%
actions and now the actions before this
 
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislature body so as context and I
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we have the
 
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:33.530 align:start position:0%
context the department and the board
 
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:36.410 align:start position:0%
have been responding to a specific
 
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:40.070 align:start position:0%
statute passed by the legislature that
 
00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:43.250 align:start position:0%
statute states very simply the State
 
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.010 align:start position:0%
Board of Education shall adopt rules
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 541 a doesn't give anybody
 
00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
an option relative to the approval of
 
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:53.950 align:start position:0%
alternative programs for granting credit
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
leading to graduation
 
00:55:59.050 --> 00:55:59.060 align:start position:0%
this mandate to the board is really
 
00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:01.970 align:start position:0%
quite unambiguous and both the board and
 
00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:04.220 align:start position:0%
the agency understands the important
 
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:06.890 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we have to have
 
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:09.470 align:start position:0%
fidelity to the statute in adopting
 
00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:12.020 align:start position:0%
rules it states that the board shall
 
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.130 align:start position:0%
adopt rules
 
00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:16.100 align:start position:0%
the legislature has ordered the board to
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
create rules in response to this statute
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
and the board has
 
00:56:27.609 --> 00:56:27.619 align:start position:0%
edie 1400 testimony when RSA 193 e2a 5b
 
00:56:30.039 --> 00:56:30.049 align:start position:0%
was passed made clear how the agency
 
00:56:32.469 --> 00:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
understood this law and how it would be
 
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:35.170 align:start position:0%
implemented that is part of the record
 
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
edy 1400 is consistent with that
 
00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:41.390 align:start position:0%
testimony attempts were made during the
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
last legislative session to modify the
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
agency's understanding of RSA 193 hua 5b
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
and those were not successful that means
 
00:56:56.529 --> 00:56:56.539 align:start position:0%
that the this legislative body affirmed
 
00:56:58.690 --> 00:56:58.700 align:start position:0%
that the agency's understanding of the
 
00:57:01.329 --> 00:57:01.339 align:start position:0%
law was appropriate it's interesting
 
00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:04.849 align:start position:0%
that representative hatch talks about
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
the JAL car being a non partisan board
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the long history of the
 
00:57:13.979 --> 00:57:13.989 align:start position:0%
JAL car attorneys and the nonpartisan
 
00:57:16.509 --> 00:57:16.519 align:start position:0%
approach that it has taken to many
 
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:18.650 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation in the past in
 
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:21.710 align:start position:0%
this particular instance it is important
 
00:57:24.489 --> 00:57:24.499 align:start position:0%
to point out that every vote that was
 
00:57:27.279 --> 00:57:27.289 align:start position:0%
taken on the learn everywhere rules on
 
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:31.700 align:start position:0%
edy 1400 was strictly along partisan
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
lines so hardly nonpartisan in that
 
00:57:37.269 --> 00:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
sense the law in addition to stating
 
00:57:40.059 --> 00:57:40.069 align:start position:0%
that we shall adopt rules also said it
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules for the approval of
 
00:57:44.499 --> 00:57:44.509 align:start position:0%
alternative programs what is really
 
00:57:45.609 --> 00:57:45.619 align:start position:0%
interesting if you're in New Hampshire
 
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:48.650 align:start position:0%
we have a great set of very wide and
 
00:57:50.739 --> 00:57:50.749 align:start position:0%
flexible rules for all of our public
 
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:52.460 align:start position:0%
schools whether those are traditional or
 
00:57:54.729 --> 00:57:54.739 align:start position:0%
charter to be able to develop and
 
00:57:57.249 --> 00:57:57.259 align:start position:0%
implement lots of different varieties of
 
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
student programming the agency's
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of RSA 183 e2 a 5b is that
 
00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:07.700 align:start position:0%
an alternative or different program be
 
00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:10.420 align:start position:0%
established not simply a really
 
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:13.430 align:start position:0%
reiteration of that which already exists
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
an IDI 1400 accomplishes this goal in
 
00:58:20.529 --> 00:58:20.539 align:start position:0%
the feedback that we received from JAL
 
00:58:23.709 --> 00:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
car in several instances whether it was
 
00:58:26.259 --> 00:58:26.269 align:start position:0%
in comments or formal responses they say
 
00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:28.130 align:start position:0%
why don't you just do this or why don't
 
00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:30.140 align:start position:0%
you just do that well because those were
 
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.450 align:start position:0%
not alternatives those existed
 
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:35.900 align:start position:0%
in statute and enroll today so they
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
would not meet the legislative intent of
 
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:41.900 align:start position:0%
this rule and then the final aspect of
 
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:44.270 align:start position:0%
the law that I in the statute that you
 
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:47.450 align:start position:0%
all passed that I want to point out is
 
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:49.370 align:start position:0%
it says it is for granting credit
 
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:52.910 align:start position:0%
leading to graduation and this phrase is
 
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
quite clear and contains no subject
 
00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:58.810 align:start position:0%
subjunctive expression or uncertainty
 
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:02.180 align:start position:0%
credits are granted and credits lead to
 
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.100 align:start position:0%
credits are granted and credits lead to
graduation

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:03.110 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
there is no conditional furbished in RSA
 
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:10.670 align:start position:0%
193 e to a 5 B such that the agency
 
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:12.350 align:start position:0%
could understand that credits may be
 
00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
granted or that credits may lead to
 
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
graduation the law is very clear
 
00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:21.650 align:start position:0%
edie 1400 is limiting in that it doesn't
 
00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
say says we have to lead to credit
 
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:26.450 align:start position:0%
leading to graduation it does not result
 
00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
in graduation but only credits that are
 
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:32.210 align:start position:0%
earned result in leading to graduation
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
this was actually one of the points that
 
00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:38.060 align:start position:0%
was addressed in the testimony with gel
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
car and I want to just quote one of the
 
00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:41.660 align:start position:0%
gel car members representative Schmidt
 
00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:44.390 align:start position:0%
who raised a question and you see that
 
00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:46.820 align:start position:0%
he said quote since the diploma is
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
granted in the name of and on the
 
00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:52.580 align:start position:0%
authority of the local school board to
 
00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:54.740 align:start position:0%
the degree that elements of it would be
 
00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:57.950 align:start position:0%
effectively forced in against their will
 
01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:00.290 align:start position:0%
is that not going to cause trouble in
 
01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:02.570 align:start position:0%
the long run and what I would tell you
 
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:05.330 align:start position:0%
is this is a program for earning credit
 
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
and it does not trample on the local
 
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:10.970 align:start position:0%
responsibilities where's Bob Elliott on
 
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:14.030 align:start position:0%
my screen local school districts have
 
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:17.270 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to determine what the
 
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:19.940 align:start position:0%
requirements are for graduation this
 
01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:22.850 align:start position:0%
program allows students an alternative
 
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
program for accumulating credits that
 
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:28.730 align:start position:0%
lead to graduation from that high school
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
so local control is fully preserved by
 
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:34.850 align:start position:0%
representative Elliott and I hope that
 
01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:37.700 align:start position:0%
that is understood as you begin to
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
consider these actions now the we've
 
01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:43.609 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
competency-based education and one of
 
01:00:49.459 --> 01:00:49.469 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up in senator
 
01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:50.209 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up in senator
Kahn's

01:00:50.209 --> 01:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
Kahn's
 
01:00:55.099 --> 01:00:55.109 align:start position:0%
testimony was dealing with you know it
 
01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
said that the schools can't create the
 
01:00:59.479 --> 01:00:59.489 align:start position:0%
curriculum and I'm not wandering into
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
policy so I'll be very careful here but
 
01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:04.009 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting that the rules
 
01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:07.469 align:start position:0%
support the opportunities students can
 
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:09.390 align:start position:0%
get correct get credits from a lot of
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
other curricular places because credits
 
01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:14.249 align:start position:0%
are granted based on competency and I
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
think it's important for this committee
 
01:01:19.999 --> 01:01:20.009 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at the system of
 
01:01:22.039 --> 01:01:22.049 align:start position:0%
education that we have representative
 
01:01:24.259 --> 01:01:24.269 align:start position:0%
land reference did you know we want to
 
01:01:26.179 --> 01:01:26.189 align:start position:0%
create opportunities for all of our
 
01:01:27.799 --> 01:01:27.809 align:start position:0%
students to be successful to earn
 
01:01:30.259 --> 01:01:30.269 align:start position:0%
credits in all kinds of places and if
 
01:01:32.239 --> 01:01:32.249 align:start position:0%
this pandemic has done nothing else it
 
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:34.890 align:start position:0%
has emphasized the importance of making
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
sure that we meet the needs of all of
 
01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:38.939 align:start position:0%
our students the US Department of
 
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:42.380 align:start position:0%
Education defines competency or
 
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:44.910 align:start position:0%
personalized learning approaches this
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
personalized learning approaches this
way

01:01:45.439 --> 01:01:45.449 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:01:47.539 --> 01:01:47.549 align:start position:0%
it says transitioning away from seat
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
time in favor of a structure that
 
01:01:52.219 --> 01:01:52.229 align:start position:0%
creates flexibility allows students to
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
progress as they demonstrate mastery of
 
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:02.910 align:start position:0%
academic content this is the Jellico
 
01:02:08.689 --> 01:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
process right I'm not on for thirty five
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
five one four I think it is but so
 
01:02:12.859 --> 01:02:12.869 align:start position:0%
reflecting on the continued assertion by
 
01:02:14.989 --> 01:02:14.999 align:start position:0%
glck are linking curriculum and credit
 
01:02:16.939 --> 01:02:16.949 align:start position:0%
it leaves one with the impression that
 
01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:19.650 align:start position:0%
gel car remains unfamiliar with the idea
 
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:21.539 align:start position:0%
of competency or personalized learning
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
at its foundation competency or
 
01:02:26.449 --> 01:02:26.459 align:start position:0%
personalized learning asks the question
 
01:02:32.539 --> 01:02:32.549 align:start position:0%
what has a student master learn
 
01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
everywhere program I understand you know
 
01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:39.390 align:start position:0%
so the department recognizes the
 
01:02:41.059 --> 01:02:41.069 align:start position:0%
importance and the validity of the gel
 
01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:43.049 align:start position:0%
car process and its feedback on the
 
01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:45.989 align:start position:0%
proposed IDI 1,400 rules we have
 
01:02:47.989 --> 01:02:47.999 align:start position:0%
carefully considered those objections
 
01:02:50.179 --> 01:02:50.189 align:start position:0%
have made appropriate amendments to the
 
01:02:52.009 --> 01:02:52.019 align:start position:0%
preliminary objections in the proposed
 
01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:54.230 align:start position:0%
DD 1400 rules and
 
01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:56.270 align:start position:0%
been responsive to gel car throughout
 
01:02:59.080 --> 01:02:59.090 align:start position:0%
the process what we have also done is
 
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:04.430 align:start position:0%
achieve fidelity to RSA 193 e to a 5 B
 
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:07.180 align:start position:0%
and fidelity to the overall purpose of
 
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:12.290 align:start position:0%
RSA 193 e and these rules should be
 
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.250 align:start position:0%
passed into effect for students in New
 
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:19.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they follow the
 
01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:22.670 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and they have for
 
01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
well over a year now and it's only
 
01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:27.619 align:start position:0%
because it's been stuck in this gel car
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
process that we have not been able to
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
create opportunities for our students
 
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:33.770 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so then I will
 
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:35.660 align:start position:0%
stop my comments and let you guys move
 
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:36.980 align:start position:0%
on but I'll take questions if anybody
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
has any thank you very much commissioner
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:46.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:47.690 align:start position:0%
commissioner for joining us this
 
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:53.650 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
let's see according to my list Jen there
 
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:03.260 align:start position:0%
was potentially representative from the
 
01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:06.350 align:start position:0%
elo network that wanted to testify but I
 
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
don't know who that is we have we have
 
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:11.930 align:start position:0%
them here I can promote them now I'm her
 
01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:16.190 align:start position:0%
name they are they wishing to forum it
 
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:21.070 align:start position:0%
was somewhat unclear from the message um
 
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
would you would like to ask her her name
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
can can can attendees raise their hand
 
01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:49.070 align:start position:0%
to indicate I guess on the alternative
 
01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:50.420 align:start position:0%
is there another member of the New
 
01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elo network that would would
 
01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
care to offer live testimony that's the
 
01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:02.450 align:start position:0%
only person that I saw that group they
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
may be rejoined as they had been with us
 
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:13.790 align:start position:0%
and we'll check again a little short yep
 
01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:16.670 align:start position:0%
I'd like to like to invite mr. Donnell

very much for joining us this afternoon
 
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.130 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chair members of the House
 
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:48.410 align:start position:0%
Education Committee for the record my
 
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Tuttle president of Nea
 
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:52.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representing 17,000
 
01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
educators across the state of New
 
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:55.970 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here before you
 
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:57.890 align:start position:0%
remotely in support of Senate joint
 
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:00.650 align:start position:0%
resolution 1 we support the final
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
objection and this joint resolution
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
issued by gel car and its reasons for
 
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:07.580 align:start position:0%
doing so at 1400 is contrary to the
 
01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:09.470 align:start position:0%
statute it was passed under and that the
 
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:11.630 align:start position:0%
State Board under long-standing law does
 
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:13.700 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to require a school
 
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:16.070 align:start position:0%
district to accept credit senator Kahn
 
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:17.900 align:start position:0%
some of my other colleagues who express
 
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
these objections I would simply like to
 
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
add that there's an important practical
 
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:23.690 align:start position:0%
reason why New Hampshire's followed
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
local control of credit granting and
 
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
it's statutes for so long because it
 
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
values the role of the educator in the
 
01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:32.270 align:start position:0%
process of student learning in addition
 
01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
as classroom teachers we must meet
 
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:36.410 align:start position:0%
specific requirements go through the
 
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:38.060 align:start position:0%
process of applying and meeting the
 
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:39.890 align:start position:0%
standards necessary to be certified
 
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:43.900 align:start position:0%
educators so excuse me miss well I just
 
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:47.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to keep this fairly tight to
 
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:51.170 align:start position:0%
the so so you've you've you've mentioned
 
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:56.090 align:start position:0%
that existing law you know provides
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
credit granting Authority now you're
 
01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:01.310 align:start position:0%
sort of justifying what that why that
 
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:02.750 align:start position:0%
existing law is in place but if we can
 
01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
try to keep it really close to the to
 
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:09.230 align:start position:0%
the jail car structure yet let me just
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:18.170 align:start position:0%
basically the public elo programming
 
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:19.850 align:start position:0%
programs that we have are operating
 
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:21.230 align:start position:0%
under the rules that are already
 
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:22.970 align:start position:0%
approved by gel car for alternative
 
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:25.510 align:start position:0%
programs and so we're supporting the
 
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:31.250 align:start position:0%
joint resolution as written okay thank
 
01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
you very much mr. Hubbell are there are
 
01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:36.940 align:start position:0%
there questions for um for Megan Tuttle
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
was that a hand
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander we stop
 
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:42.590 align:start position:0%
pressing something all right
 
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:48.980 align:start position:0%
no let's see screen any further
 
01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.050 align:start position:0%
no let's see screen any further
questions

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:50.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:51.849 --> 01:07:51.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:53.330 align:start position:0%
joining us this afternoon
 
01:07:58.930 --> 01:07:58.940 align:start position:0%
thank you um let's see so I guess one

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:56.510 align:start position:0%
brawl welcome to health education if you
 
01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
could introduce yourself and then share
 
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:01.850 align:start position:0%
with us some thoughts my name is Maureen
 
01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:06.020 align:start position:0%
Crowell and I am a mother of three
 
01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:09.350 align:start position:0%
children who were educated in New
 
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:11.210 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public schools and went on to
 
01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:18.340 align:start position:0%
UNH I am testifying in support of this
 
01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:22.190 align:start position:0%
joint resolution because I believe that
 
01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:24.830 align:start position:0%
the State Department the State Board of
 
01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:29.739 align:start position:0%
Education has overstepped their
 
01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:33.380 align:start position:0%
authority in expecting local school
 
01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:40.870 align:start position:0%
districts to grant graduation credits
 
01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:48.620 align:start position:0%
based on learning sites venues providers
 
01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:52.940 align:start position:0%
outside their sphere of influence I also
 
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:56.930 align:start position:0%
believe that these same local school
 
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:00.530 align:start position:0%
districts have the responsibility to the
 
01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:02.650 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in their community
 
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:10.300 align:start position:0%
to debt these sites and to accredit them
 
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:14.860 align:start position:0%
and to oversee them my children have
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of the extended learning
 
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
opportunities and gotten science credit
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the school district
 
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:25.930 align:start position:0%
or I know that the school district
 
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:29.530 align:start position:0%
provided oversight of the goals of that
 
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:32.110 align:start position:0%
program and the granting of credit
 
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
towards graduation I think that this is
 
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
a redundant program that's been offered
 
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:42.010 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of Education and
 
01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:44.830 align:start position:0%
lastly I would suggest that they take
 
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:46.990 align:start position:0%
the money to implement such a program
 
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
and extend the extended learning
 
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:54.130 align:start position:0%
opportunities in property poor towns who
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably don't have the level of
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
extended learning opportunities that
 
01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:05.530 align:start position:0%
many of us have and that's what I want
 
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:08.980 align:start position:0%
to say thank you mrs. Prall um would you
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
be willing to take a question sure
 
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:19.050 align:start position:0%
okay representative cordially thank you
 
01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and this problem being here I
 
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:25.330 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if you had read the
 
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:27.610 align:start position:0%
rules that had been proposed by the
 
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:33.510 align:start position:0%
department and process for accepting
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
partners into the yellow program through
 
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:40.690 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education are those
 
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:43.210 align:start position:0%
the ones that were posted on the estate
 
01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:46.900 align:start position:0%
Board of Education website back in well
 
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.050 align:start position:0%
I thought it was last summer or was it
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
last fall it was 80 1,400 I don't know
 
01:12:59.970 --> 01:12:59.980 align:start position:0%
it by number I know that I have I have
 
01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
read the the bill a while ago follow up
 
01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:15.230 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:20.860 align:start position:0%
and I actually your children or
 
01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:23.540 align:start position:0%
participating in yellow
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
program and getting credits do you have
 
01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:29.420 align:start position:0%
any idea how many the percentage let's
 
01:13:32.919 --> 01:13:32.929 align:start position:0%
say of eligible students in the state do
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
get yellow credits currently I have no
 
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:41.150 align:start position:0%
idea yeah yeah I think that's that's
 
01:13:43.959 --> 01:13:43.969 align:start position:0%
sort of beyond I think I'm just I'm just
 
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:46.370 align:start position:0%
a parent I'm doing parents right I
 
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:49.310 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect thank you very much miss
 
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
Opoku seeing no other no further
 
01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:56.350 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll close the hearing on
 
01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:00.860 align:start position:0%
resolution one I apologize for
 
01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
interrupting I just wanted to let you
 
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:04.010 align:start position:0%
know that while Ms Pro speaking that
 
01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:07.100 align:start position:0%
Donna KOTOR from the elo network was
 
01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:09.590 align:start position:0%
able to reconnect if you did want to
 
01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:11.900 align:start position:0%
hear from her you know I think we just
 
01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
closed the hearing we've we've heard
 
01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:18.469 align:start position:0%
quite a bit apologize to miss cooter on
 
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
that but we tried a couple of times
 
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:23.780 align:start position:0%
there and so with the hearing closed
 
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:26.350 align:start position:0%
we're going to actually move into an
 
01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:31.460 align:start position:0%
exact session and that way we can you
 
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:34.820 align:start position:0%

01:14:41.169 --> 01:14:41.179 align:start position:0%
decided to do with with this piece of
 
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:44.510 align:start position:0%
legislation before us and so Jen I think
 
01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:47.150 align:start position:0%

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:03.290 align:start position:0%
do I have to have the links read the
 
01:15:07.689 --> 01:15:07.699 align:start position:0%

resolution one and I would take a motion
 
01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:36.090 align:start position:0%
from let's see we're gonna take a motion
 
01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:41.790 align:start position:0%
from from representative Mullin of ought
 
01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
to pass as that motion been seconded by
 
01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
representative alone and is there we
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
represent Mullin like to speak to her
 
01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I'd be happy to speak to my
 
01:22:59.210 --> 01:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
motion I think that we ought to pass
 
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
this resolution and let it go through if
 
01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:05.610 align:start position:0%
it does nothing else other than clarify
 
01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:07.950 align:start position:0%
whether or not the State Board of
 
01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:10.110 align:start position:0%
Education has the rulemaking authority
 
01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:14.970 align:start position:0%
that ed 1400 claimed that it did I don't
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like I have any better
 
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
answer to the question
 
01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:21.810 align:start position:0%
now than I did them so I think that the
 
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
joint resolution oughta stand
 
01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:28.170 align:start position:0%
terrific any representative alone any
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%

01:23:41.150 --> 01:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
the motion you're muted mark it's just
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%

any other members wishing to speak on
 
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:53.310 align:start position:0%

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
gonna call on representative Ladd right
 
01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:04.830 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you need to respond to the
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
prompt on your screen just let me take
 
01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:11.190 align:start position:0%
my own little microphone I'll cross it
 
01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
my own little microphone I'll cross it
out

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:13.610 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
when SB 435 went into effect that's the
 
01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:22.110 align:start position:0%
initial bill there are several you there
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
that were present at that time and we've
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about intent today intent
 
01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:33.810 align:start position:0%
of that law the basic intent that what
 
01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
law was to get away from all this seat
 
01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:39.090 align:start position:0%
time we have in these classrooms right
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
now in the traditional location it's
 
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
about student competency and it's about
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
varied real-life experiences an outside
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
tradition outside the traditional walls
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
and and so we went ahead with that and
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
the vote on that particular bill came
 
01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
out 17 to 3 a bipartisan vote in support
 
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
of this bill but then all of a sudden
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're hearing all this while this
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
conflicts with my little school here
 
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:13.770 align:start position:0%
being able to approve these credits but
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
right now we also have credits coming in
 
01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:18.510 align:start position:0%
from other locations be it through the
 
01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:20.910 align:start position:0%
military compact or alternative learning
 
01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
situations that a kid comes into school
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
transfers in that local school board
 
01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
hasn't approved the courses those kids
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
took elsewhere but the courses are
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
accepted towards graduation
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm feeling to see where really what
 
01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:42.030 align:start position:0%
is the basic underlying cause for these
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
rules to be denied you know I'm talking
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
about the rules to start at 1400 and go
 
01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:50.370 align:start position:0%
through 1407 and there are very clear
 
01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
rules they specifically state what the
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
program goals are accountability
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
rationale it's all there in fact there's
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
more accountability for this than there
 
01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
is in many of these classes which are
 
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
accepted by a school principal when it
 
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
come and when a child moves in so I'm
 
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:10.470 align:start position:0%
just feeling understand why we're not
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
providing the opportunity for an
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
adequate child right child to all kids
 
01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:17.430 align:start position:0%
in this state even those kids that are
 
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:19.230 align:start position:0%
in schools where they don't have a
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
person to identify alternative learning
 
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:24.450 align:start position:0%
programs or they don't have the funding
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to provide that the challenges within
 
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:29.910 align:start position:0%
the school because of their zip code and
 
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:33.450 align:start position:0%
so once again this committee is denying
 
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:35.730 align:start position:0%
educational choice and I think it's a
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:47.410 align:start position:0%
thank you and I still needed know you're
 
01:26:49.650 --> 01:26:49.660 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think I heard anything that
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
explains to me the basis for the intent
 
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:06.490 align:start position:0%
objection a statute in place is very
 
01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:08.860 align:start position:0%
clearly the State Board of Education
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules relative to the
 
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:16.030 align:start position:0%
approval of alternative programs for
 
01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:19.030 align:start position:0%
credits it's a mandate
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's a Shou that's what the State
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:31.870 align:start position:0%
suggestions that have been made through
 
01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
the gel car process they have put in an
 
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:40.930 align:start position:0%
approval review process with local ELO
 
01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:43.420 align:start position:0%
people involved local school board
 
01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:47.430 align:start position:0%
members involved that has all been done
 
01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:53.260 align:start position:0%
we heard from the representative car
 
01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:55.660 align:start position:0%
that he didn't want to discuss the
 
01:27:59.160 --> 01:27:59.170 align:start position:0%
statutes but seemed to me that that was
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
his basis for the objections to the
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
rules so I do not understand the the
 
01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:15.790 align:start position:0%
reason for this resolution because the
 
01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:20.530 align:start position:0%
statute has been upheld with subsequent
 
01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:23.980 align:start position:0%
votes after its passage and it is the
 
01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:27.130 align:start position:0%
law I don't know what could be clearer
 
01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:31.690 align:start position:0%
than what is written in the statute and
 
01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:34.690 align:start position:0%
if anybody else like to share a thought
 
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:44.190 align:start position:0%
representative Elliot wanted to ask
 
01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:48.460 align:start position:0%
Edler stated the Commission stated quote
 
01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:50.650 align:start position:0%
the State Board shall adopt rules on
 
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:54.150 align:start position:0%
both what is the source of that so
 
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:57.290 align:start position:0%
you've got the question to the chair
 
01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
the the source of that is actually the
 
01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
the reference to the Senate bill that
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
that that I think I mentioned during
 
01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:12.710 align:start position:0%
during the commissioners testimony and
 
01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:14.090 align:start position:0%
he thought I might have been referring
 
01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:18.050 align:start position:0%
to the next bill but Senate bill 435
 
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:24.860 align:start position:0%
from the 2018 session says the State
 
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:27.490 align:start position:0%
Board of Education shall adopt rules ,
 
01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:32.030 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 541 a comma relative to
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
the approval of alternative programs for
 
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
represent bland you've got a you've got
 
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:01.330 align:start position:0%
a click that blue one I always see red
 
01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:06.110 align:start position:0%
and what you got a blue shirt on par me
 
01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:08.630 align:start position:0%
you got a blue shirt on I know that's
 
01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:10.250 align:start position:0%
because it's long-sleeve it's cold up
 
01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:16.370 align:start position:0%
here what you read was correct
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's the RSA 193 econ to Roman 5 a and B
 
01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:26.300 align:start position:0%
and n B it basically does say that this
 
01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:29.660 align:start position:0%
is a mandate to the State Board and that
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
was referenced and that was put into law
 
01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:36.470 align:start position:0%
with 435 so that the intent was so clear
 
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
and yet now we're we're saying well
 
01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:43.220 align:start position:0%
where's your legislative intent and it
 
01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:47.300 align:start position:0%
Scullion law it's in statute what this
 
01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education did is in
 
01:30:52.210 --> 01:30:52.220 align:start position:0%
accordance with it would one's good
 
01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:56.470 align:start position:0%
policy and law are you oh dear
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
ok thanks thanks Rick Donny Thank You
 
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd are there further
 
01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:05.570 align:start position:0%
further thoughts anybody would like to
 
01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:10.810 align:start position:0%
share before we call the vote
 
01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:14.300 align:start position:0%
represent Shaw has her hand up represent
 
01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:23.150 align:start position:0%
Shaw thank you I agree very strongly
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
with what representative Labs said for
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
the last four or five years on the
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
Education Committee we have worked hard
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
to expand loz to expand opportunities
 
01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:37.820 align:start position:0%
competency-based learning everything
 
01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:40.630 align:start position:0%
that we could possibly do to help kids
 
01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:45.710 align:start position:0%
expand their seat time and all of a
 
01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:50.330 align:start position:0%
sudden it's lean learn everywhere came
 
01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:52.820 align:start position:0%
out and it was oh my god this is a
 
01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:55.730 align:start position:0%
horrible thing I'm sorry but I don't
 
01:31:59.320 --> 01:31:59.330 align:start position:0%
think there's a question one bit in the
 
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:06.050 align:start position:0%
law as to what the intent was for SB 435
 
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:11.510 align:start position:0%
or HP whichever SRB 435 anyway and I I
 
01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:15.380 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that this that we not
 
01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of this I think it's very
 
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
clear in law and have thought that for
 
01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:22.370 align:start position:0%
quite a while
 
01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:31.310 align:start position:0%

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:35.060 align:start position:0%

just to clarify we are the motion is
 
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:43.640 align:start position:0%

a tally of 11 yes and eight days Senate
 
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:14.270 align:start position:0%
joint resolution one is recommended not
 
01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:16.180 align:start position:0%
to pass by house of decay
 
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:19.250 align:start position:0%
I'll call to a close the executive
 
01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:24.860 align:start position:0%
session on FDR one is is there going to
 
01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:28.580 align:start position:0%
be Minority Report
 
01:35:34.450 --> 01:35:34.460 align:start position:0%
oh let's yeah let's represent Vlad yes
 
01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
and so so let's let's just talk about
 
01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:42.170 align:start position:0%
that real real quick and representative
 
01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:47.380 align:start position:0%
Mullen would would you care to write the
 
01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:56.300 align:start position:0%
are you giving me an option on whether
 
01:35:57.670 --> 01:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
or not I want to write this committee
 
01:35:59.920 --> 01:35:59.930 align:start position:0%
report I want to be clear on this yeah
 
01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:02.900 align:start position:0%
well I'm just confirming I sort of
 
01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:05.170 align:start position:0%
thought that's what you might be doing
 
01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:09.230 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the what the process
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the procedure is so that that's what
 
01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:13.250 align:start position:0%
I wanted to talk about in representative
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
lad will you take care of the Minority
 
01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:20.930 align:start position:0%
Report or between you and Glen yes so
 
01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
what I what I'd like you to do if you
 
01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:28.460 align:start position:0%
could email me and and representative
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
miler those those by let's see we got
 
01:36:41.230 --> 01:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow maybe by the end of the day
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday oh sure would be a problem
 
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:47.510 align:start position:0%
Dave I'll do this one and the next one
 
01:36:49.090 --> 01:36:49.100 align:start position:0%
we haven't had yet I'm just assuming
 
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:50.690 align:start position:0%
we're going to be the minority corps
 
01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
Delhi will write that one okay okay yeah
 
01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:57.170 align:start position:0%
I could get if if Mel and I could get
 
01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.050 align:start position:0%
get the reports by the end of the day
 
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:03.740 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I think that would be does
 
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:05.810 align:start position:0%
that give us time Jen yeah because it's
 
01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:12.140 align:start position:0%
two weeks to the next what happens
 
01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
two weeks to the next what happens
Thursday

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:16.810 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:20.870 align:start position:0%

for processing
 
01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:27.980 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic um yeah no matter what
 
01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
happens on Thursday this can
 
01:37:31.570 --> 01:37:31.580 align:start position:0%
he needs to finish its work though on
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
these two bills and we need you know
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%

01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
gonna produce report so so thanks very
 
01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:45.230 align:start position:0%
much on that so next up we've already
 
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:49.010 align:start position:0%
adjourned the exact session okay and and
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%

01:37:55.930 --> 01:37:55.940 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 514 next and
 
01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
we're running about 41 minutes behind
 
01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
but hopefully we can make up some some
 
01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:04.910 align:start position:0%
time but where we won't be able to make
 
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:08.500 align:start position:0%
up time is on the on what I have to read
 
01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:13.190 align:start position:0%
at the start so I will do my best to
 
01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:17.570 align:start position:0%
move through it quickly so first I'm

Kennedy so we're here today to talk
about

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
SB 5:14 you've heard all the wise and
 
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:33.860 align:start position:0%
wherefore of the reasons that we are
 
01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:37.490 align:start position:0%
putting forward SB 514 today I have to
 
01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:40.790 align:start position:0%
say I'm disappointed to hear that some
 
01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:42.470 align:start position:0%
people seem to think they've made up
 
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:45.500 align:start position:0%
their mind even before we present on the
 
01:46:48.670 --> 01:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
bill and have decided that they're going
 
01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:51.650 align:start position:0%
to write the Minority Report and it
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
seems that the person who was assigned
 
01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:55.460 align:start position:0%
to write the minority report is actually
 
01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:58.130 align:start position:0%
leaving the meeting so I'm a little
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
disappointed that we're not going to you
 
01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:03.140 align:start position:0%
know have a have a real hearing here and
 
01:47:04.210 --> 01:47:04.220 align:start position:0%
I hope that we will
 
01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:07.580 align:start position:0%
well no no senator I don't mean to
 
01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:09.590 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but we always have real
 
01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
hearings and House education and and
 
01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:15.110 align:start position:0%
also I do want to point out that that I
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
believe representative Labs not the one
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
that said he needed to leave the meeting
 
01:47:22.330 --> 01:47:22.340 align:start position:0%
early so so you do have our full
 
01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:24.350 align:start position:0%
attention thank you no I thought he has
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
signed representative Cordell II who I
 
01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
thought said oh no no and represent
 
01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:32.380 align:start position:0%
Cordell II I don't believe is leaving
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I didn't mean to
 
01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:39.410 align:start position:0%
impugn anyone I misheard what was going
 
01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:44.420 align:start position:0%
on so we've we've put together this new
 
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:46.970 align:start position:0%
bill because our understanding of the
 
01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:50.210 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of 435 was that the
 
01:47:55.570 --> 01:47:55.580 align:start position:0%
rules would said that the Board of
 
01:47:58.180 --> 01:47:58.190 align:start position:0%
Education would create rules for
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
districts to approve alternative
 
01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:02.300 align:start position:0%
programs not that it would take over the
 
01:48:04.630 --> 01:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
approval of the program and forced them
 
01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:07.190 align:start position:0%
on the district to me that was the
 
01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:11.030 align:start position:0%
simple difference that may not have come
 
01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:13.190 align:start position:0%
out in the previous hearing but at any
 
01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
point we have put together legislation
 
01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:20.270 align:start position:0%
in SB 514 that is not about whether
 
01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
schools offer alternative programs or
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
even whether the state school board
 
01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:31.460 align:start position:0%
offers alternative programs and approves
 
01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:36.950 align:start position:0%
them it is only about whether districts
 
01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:38.550 align:start position:0%
are required to it
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
except the specific alternative programs
 
01:48:49.069 --> 01:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
that the school board approves so we've
 
01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:50.790 align:start position:0%
had a lot of talk about yellows and how
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
wonderful they are
 
01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:56.250 align:start position:0%
I know public schools are very eager to
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
offer yellows some of the schools can't
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
afford the extra staff that are
 
01:49:05.359 --> 01:49:05.369 align:start position:0%
necessary to offer them and if you had
 
01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:08.130 align:start position:0%
heard from the head of the elo that
 
01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:12.030 align:start position:0%
person might have said that most schools
 
01:49:13.879 --> 01:49:13.889 align:start position:0%
would love to offer yellows if they had
 
01:49:15.859 --> 01:49:15.869 align:start position:0%
the money to do so and I thought that
 
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:17.670 align:start position:0%
the parent who came forward and spoke
 
01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:21.630 align:start position:0%
about why don't we use the money from
 
01:49:23.839 --> 01:49:23.849 align:start position:0%
they learn everywhere program to give
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
the less able schools the ability to
 
01:49:28.819 --> 01:49:28.829 align:start position:0%
offer yellows that that would be a more
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
useful use of it made a very good point
 
01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:39.150 align:start position:0%
I think that what what I bet people who
 
01:49:41.959 --> 01:49:41.969 align:start position:0%
are not from the educational industry
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
background as I am may not understand is
 
01:49:48.049 --> 01:49:48.059 align:start position:0%
that the difference between the State
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
Approved learn every core program and
 
01:49:55.819 --> 01:49:55.829 align:start position:0%
what goes on with an elo at the public
 
01:49:59.839 --> 01:49:59.849 align:start position:0%
school I was also on the Carmel school
 
01:50:01.479 --> 01:50:01.489 align:start position:0%
board I don't know if I mentioned that
 
01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:06.150 align:start position:0%
is that with the elo there's close
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
supervision there's a a person who
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
either guidance counselor or a teacher
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
or staff member who has recommended that
 
01:50:20.569 --> 01:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
yellow for a particular student and as
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
the student is in that program whether
 
01:50:26.979 --> 01:50:26.989 align:start position:0%
it's you know learning to weld or it's
 
01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:31.290 align:start position:0%
more of an industry outreach there is
 
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
someone who's watching and checking on
 
01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:36.030 align:start position:0%
that student and making sure that
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
there's a good fit going in and talking
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the mentor at the industrial place or
 
01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:44.550 align:start position:0%
other or the teacher or whatever's going
 
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:47.010 align:start position:0%
on outside of the school if there are
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
problems there's oversight that's an elo
 
01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:55.530 align:start position:0%
the what what is under the learn
 
01:50:59.540 --> 01:50:59.550 align:start position:0%
everywhere program is a process where an
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
outside program that might be offered
 
01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:06.750 align:start position:0%
like an educational publisher like me it
 
01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:10.290 align:start position:0%
is approved once every three years I
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
believe is the actual timing once it's
 
01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:19.050 align:start position:0%
approved every school in the state would
 
01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:23.970 align:start position:0%
have been required under the old rule to
 
01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:27.210 align:start position:0%
accept that program so what we're
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting is the State Board approves
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
programs like that so I as an
 
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
educational publisher don't have to go
 
01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:36.450 align:start position:0%
around to every single school district
 
01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:38.310 align:start position:0%
in the state and say look at my
 
01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
wonderful program I think you should
 
01:51:42.230 --> 01:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
adopt it no we can go to the State Board
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
of Education and say look at my
 
01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:47.090 align:start position:0%
wonderful program it's approved once and
 
01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:50.910 align:start position:0%
every every district then knows that oh
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
the state's reviewed this we may want to
 
01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:55.950 align:start position:0%
adopt it we may want to let kids use
 
01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:58.590 align:start position:0%
this program and that's the difference
 
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:02.010 align:start position:0%
between learn everywhere and extended
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities so what we want
 
01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:08.310 align:start position:0%
to make clear here is that when
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
something is approved by the learn
 
01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:14.250 align:start position:0%
everywhere program that the school
 
01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:16.650 align:start position:0%
district has the option to say I mean
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to Bedford it's in my district
 
01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:22.290 align:start position:0%
and and Sue Ellen is here so if Bedford
 
01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:26.130 align:start position:0%
says okay well the state has proved this
 
01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:31.650 align:start position:0%
online calculus calculus light and
 
01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:34.170 align:start position:0%
that's an option
 
01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:36.810 align:start position:0%
I have Bedford I don't really want to
 
01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
have my kids get calculus credit for
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
online calculus light I'm not going to
 
01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:44.130 align:start position:0%
accept that program
 
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:49.650 align:start position:0%
so what SB 514 is making clear is that
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
the districts can decide that they don't
 
01:52:59.090 --> 01:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
want to accept that credit terrific
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:53:03.290 --> 01:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
senator for introducing the bill are
 
01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:05.219 align:start position:0%
there questions of
 
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:06.810 align:start position:0%
senator deechi from members of the
 
01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:11.570 align:start position:0%
committee you can go ahead and I see
 
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative lads hand up I know he's
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
on the phone right now are there uh is
 
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:20.100 align:start position:0%
there anybody else that would like to
 
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:23.790 align:start position:0%
Rick are you all yeah I just want the
 
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:26.250 align:start position:0%
senator to know that what I said the
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
previous meeting I'm trying to do two
 
01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:31.290 align:start position:0%
zooms at once right now II D and a over
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the Senate is hearing some
 
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
christmas-tree tight bills and so I'm
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
trying to stay on top of what's going on
 
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:40.230 align:start position:0%
there however I do have a question on
 
01:53:43.630 --> 01:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
this particular bill of the senator I'm
 
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:46.650 align:start position:0%
reading the the bill as it was amended
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to ask no we're in this
 
01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:54.770 align:start position:0%
bill do I see that the State Board shall
 
01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:00.630 align:start position:0%
develop a list of vendors which are
 
01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:04.350 align:start position:0%
accepted or approved I'm seeing that
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
there's a pre pre approved list
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
maintained by the board but it doesn't
 
01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:12.750 align:start position:0%
it just says it will establish a process
 
01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:14.930 align:start position:0%
to do all this but it doesn't seem that
 
01:54:17.689 --> 01:54:17.699 align:start position:0%
say that that's going to result in a
 
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
list of approved vendors could you
 
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
please explain what the intent of this
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill is is somewhat confusing to me
 
01:54:33.130 --> 01:54:33.140 align:start position:0%
further yes so it will be up to the
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
school board that are the do e to come
 
01:54:39.979 --> 01:54:39.989 align:start position:0%
up with the rules which define the
 
01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:43.890 align:start position:0%
process what we do in in legislation is
 
01:54:48.170 --> 01:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
to outline what they're able to do given
 
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they have already defined the
 
01:54:54.979 --> 01:54:54.989 align:start position:0%
process in 1400 we're expecting that
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
they'll come up with something very very
 
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
similar in fact they could just resubmit
 
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:02.670 align:start position:0%
that with just changing the fact that
 
01:55:09.850 --> 01:55:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:12.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much to represent you
 
01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:15.630 align:start position:0%
know and Senator within the bill then
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing the capability of a state
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
board to
 
01:55:24.979 --> 01:55:24.989 align:start position:0%
welp rules that's being deleted so I'm
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
still really confused as far as what
 
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:29.130 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do with this bill
 
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:32.010 align:start position:0%
you're taking away that deal we are the
 
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
state boards ability to make rules
 
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:36.090 align:start position:0%
pursuant to alternative education that's
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
gone by the strike and but you just
 
01:55:41.419 --> 01:55:41.429 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there would be rules
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
developed for what you're trying you're
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
intending to do when a board establishes
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
a process that involves rules
 
01:55:57.979 --> 01:55:57.989 align:start position:0%
that's rules are necessary that is the
 
01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:01.290 align:start position:0%
way a board establishes a process is by
 
01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:05.670 align:start position:0%
creating rules further questions for the
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
senator representing core Delhi I see
 
01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:13.610 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up yes thank you I
 
01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about well first Thank You
 
01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:20.670 align:start position:0%
senator for being here
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that's what is full
 
01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:28.230 align:start position:0%
which is din your district I see he from
 
01:56:33.850 --> 01:56:33.860 align:start position:0%
the information provided by the
 
01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:38.330 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that 1% of
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
eligible students at Bedford of actually
 
01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:49.230 align:start position:0%
received credits from their yellow
 
01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:52.650 align:start position:0%
program and on the statewide basis it's
 
01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
2 percent ever seen credits so do you
 
01:57:00.729 --> 01:57:00.739 align:start position:0%
think that this program is actually
 
01:57:06.439 --> 01:57:06.449 align:start position:0%
providing the resources to the students
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
that are needed and wouldn't the current
 
01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:16.250 align:start position:0%
program that has been proposed better
 
01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:18.630 align:start position:0%
provide for the needs of students in
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
terms of other learning alternative
 
01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:26.310 align:start position:0%
programs well the Commissioner and I've
 
01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:30.030 align:start position:0%
had many many long discussions on on
 
01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
this topic and I know he's very
 
01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:33.890 align:start position:0%
this topic and I know he's very
frustrated

01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
frustrated
 
01:57:38.899 --> 01:57:38.909 align:start position:0%
by the level of adoption of yellows but
 
01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:41.130 align:start position:0%
when I talked to teachers when I talked
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
to superintendents what they tell me is
 
01:57:46.939 --> 01:57:46.949 align:start position:0%
that give us the money we'll be happy to
 
01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:51.210 align:start position:0%
do it but you know we are constantly
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
being asked to do more and more and more
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
with less and less and less and it can't
 
01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:01.670 align:start position:0%
happen so I do not believe that
 
01:58:07.759 --> 01:58:07.769 align:start position:0%
providing a list of pro of credits again
 
01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:13.110 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I of course was a
 
01:58:15.049 --> 01:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
very scrupulous member of the
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
educational publishing and
 
01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry however there are
 
01:58:27.259 --> 01:58:27.269 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who of companies who
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to directly sell
 
01:58:32.890 --> 01:58:32.900 align:start position:0%
their products and their services to
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
parents who may opt for these things
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
without understanding the real value and
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
out without understanding if they're
 
01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:47.550 align:start position:0%
right for their child and where they
 
01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
lead I think you can look at the court
 
01:58:56.109 --> 01:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
records and see how many for-profit
 
01:58:59.500 --> 01:58:59.510 align:start position:0%
educational service companies have been
 
01:59:03.529 --> 01:59:03.539 align:start position:0%
taken to court successfully for
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
providing this kind of direct directly
 
01:59:14.839 --> 01:59:14.849 align:start position:0%
sold learning products to parents and to
 
01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:19.650 align:start position:0%
to students and to veterans and and I
 
01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:22.050 align:start position:0%
don't think we want that happening in
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think that you know this
 
01:59:28.549 --> 01:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
is this is a bad idea and this is why I
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
keep reiterating that we need to keep
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
local control where the the person knows
 
01:59:39.379 --> 01:59:39.389 align:start position:0%
the student and the person is overseeing
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
the quality of the instruction that the
 
01:59:45.469 --> 01:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
student and how well the students
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
getting wrong how comfort
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
students with it I think we need that
 
01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:50.610 align:start position:0%
kind of personal oversight and you
 
01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:53.370 align:start position:0%
really are going to open yourself up to
 
01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:56.130 align:start position:0%
all kinds of issues and I'm not sure
 
01:59:58.610 --> 01:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioner IDO blue really he was
 
02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:00.030 align:start position:0%
never in the educational publishing
 
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:02.090 align:start position:0%
industry I'm not sure he really
 
02:00:05.630 --> 02:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
understands what companies like k-12 and
 
02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:08.550 align:start position:0%
the commercial vendors want to happen
 
02:00:13.190 --> 02:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's through the kinds of policies they
 
02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:18.350 align:start position:0%
are putting forward I I think that this
 
02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:22.230 align:start position:0%
idea of parental choice you know that's
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
great if the parent is well-educated and
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
has the time to review the product and
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
say there are some families that that's
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
perfect for but to force that and to
 
02:00:38.630 --> 02:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
make it available to everyone you know
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
that kind of direct sale i I just think
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
you are asking for a huge amount of
 
02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:49.650 align:start position:0%
trouble and I would not recommend it i I
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
do think that yellows are wonderful
 
02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:54.330 align:start position:0%
though and maybe we do a higher amount
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
of them over on this side of the
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
district I'm in Peterborough by the way
 
02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:04.290 align:start position:0%
but I I know that money is really the
 
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:07.710 align:start position:0%
big issue there Thank You senator
 
02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:11.670 align:start position:0%
represent of Cordell you yes thank you
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
I must have the senator based on what
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
you just said is it your belief that
 
02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:21.870 align:start position:0%
only well-educated parents and make
 
02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:24.090 align:start position:0%
proper decisions as to what's in the
 
02:01:25.930 --> 02:01:25.940 align:start position:0%
best interest of their children
 
02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:28.830 align:start position:0%
I'm sure though thank you for your
 
02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:31.310 align:start position:0%
question and I appreciate of course that
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
parents in a democracy and particularly
 
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:40.710 align:start position:0%
in the United States public education
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
has been the means for people to move up
 
02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:47.730 align:start position:0%
to greater opportunity for each
 
02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:51.990 align:start position:0%
generation to be able to to succeed that
 
02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
much more than their parents have and
 
02:01:58.190 --> 02:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know you know my parents my father
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
didn't graduate from high school so
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
really wanted you know if it's really
 
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:04.290 align:start position:0%
important to him that I went to college
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
and so forth and each generation wants
 
02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:11.330 align:start position:0%
more and better for their their kids
 
02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:14.730 align:start position:0%
when it gets into the details would my
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
father have known what courses I should
 
02:02:22.399 --> 02:02:22.409 align:start position:0%
be taking I don't think so and I think
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
that it is that ability to you know the
 
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:29.610 align:start position:0%
next generation to move beyond the
 
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:32.010 align:start position:0%
knowledge of their parents and I think
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we offer through the school
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
system thank you very much senator
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell you sold your
 
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:52.010 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah just follow to that so
 
02:02:55.689 --> 02:02:55.699 align:start position:0%
parents that are not that well educated
 
02:02:58.970 --> 02:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
cannot make those decisions and those
 
02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:01.710 align:start position:0%
decisions as to the details should be
 
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:12.270 align:start position:0%

02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%

extended learning opportunities and we
 
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:39.900 align:start position:0%

thank you for inviting me to speak on

this amendment this is the the action
 
02:05:08.630 --> 02:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
that the Senate joint resolution that
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
you previously adopted or recommended
 
02:05:17.690 --> 02:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
ought to pass this is the action that is
 
02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
suggested in that legislation excuse me
 
02:05:23.470 --> 02:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
I got a mute that Senate hearing
 
02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:32.850 align:start position:0%
representative lead so the you know I
 
02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:36.770 align:start position:0%
this this does navigate the straits that
 
02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:40.950 align:start position:0%
we were looking for this says Board of
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
Education you do have a statewide role
 
02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:47.250 align:start position:0%
you do have a perspective and you can
 
02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:52.220 align:start position:0%
provide valuable leadership and service
 
02:05:57.550 --> 02:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
to local school districts and it says
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
what is in the remainder of 193 E that
 
02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:04.650 align:start position:0%
local school districts you can choose if
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
you want to adopt this it does not
 
02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:10.890 align:start position:0%
mandate that a student presents a third
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
of their credits from someplace else and
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
that a school district has to take it
 
02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
which is what to learn everywhere rules
 
02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:20.610 align:start position:0%
stated you have no choice school
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
district if a student has completed it
 
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
you must accept it this navigates the
 
02:06:27.439 --> 02:06:27.449 align:start position:0%
streets it says
 
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:30.659 align:start position:0%
of Education it might be a statewide
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
role local school district you can
 
02:06:35.719 --> 02:06:35.729 align:start position:0%
preserve your local autonomy and
 
02:06:38.479 --> 02:06:38.489 align:start position:0%
determine if that's something now what
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
if you had students that took something
 
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
like son under each sub and they don't
 
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
do well with it
 
02:06:46.219 --> 02:06:46.229 align:start position:0%
and you at repeated itself several times
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
local school district really ought to
 
02:06:50.479 --> 02:06:50.489 align:start position:0%
have the authority of saying now it's
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
our determination it didn't work well
 
02:06:55.089 --> 02:06:55.099 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:06:59.529 --> 02:06:59.539 align:start position:0%
the commissioners own testimony on the
 
02:07:02.239 --> 02:07:02.249 align:start position:0%
learning everywhere was that well maybe
 
02:07:05.719 --> 02:07:05.729 align:start position:0%
we'll use this for gymnastics or music
 
02:07:09.459 --> 02:07:09.469 align:start position:0%
education well you can imagine that a
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
school district might have higher
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
standards for a gym credit or a music
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
course or then another statewide
 
02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
provider of them and and not allow that
 
02:07:27.850 --> 02:07:27.860 align:start position:0%
but that's the local school districts
 
02:07:31.129 --> 02:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
determination but even more important to
 
02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:34.050 align:start position:0%
the workforce development things is if
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
you are working in concert with local
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
school with local employers don't you
 
02:07:41.479 --> 02:07:41.489 align:start position:0%
think that a local school district
 
02:07:43.969 --> 02:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
really ought to determine that that's
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
where their link ought to be is with
 
02:07:49.969 --> 02:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
local employers and they can choose that
 
02:07:52.239 --> 02:07:52.249 align:start position:0%
and develop their own yellow or
 
02:07:54.949 --> 02:07:54.959 align:start position:0%
internship or work based learning kind
 
02:07:59.719 --> 02:07:59.729 align:start position:0%
of course and do that without having to
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
accept and and have their resources go
 
02:08:07.509 --> 02:08:07.519 align:start position:0%
elsewhere their students go elsewhere
 
02:08:12.979 --> 02:08:12.989 align:start position:0%
and that's a school districts option to
 
02:08:15.799 --> 02:08:15.809 align:start position:0%
try to deliver things and encourage that
 
02:08:19.250 --> 02:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
kind of development so I think I think
 
02:08:23.319 --> 02:08:23.329 align:start position:0%
what senator deechi has proposed is is
 
02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:30.030 align:start position:0%
the bill that then puts us on a course
 
02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:34.110 align:start position:0%
that I hope it can gain bipartisan
 
02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:40.110 align:start position:0%
support become the law and can be
 
02:08:40.110 --> 02:08:41.060 align:start position:0%
support become the law and can be
implemented

02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:41.070 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:43.710 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of Education Thank
 
02:08:44.569 --> 02:08:44.579 align:start position:0%
You mr. chairman
 
02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:46.550 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much senator
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
questions for um for senator Kahn going
 
02:08:58.510 --> 02:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
once going twice
 
02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:01.710 align:start position:0%

chair
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
Thank You Kim right and then next I'd
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
like to to invite Donna Couture from the
 
02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elo Network and Donna
 
02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
you're already in so welcome to the
 
02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:21.810 align:start position:0%
house education thank you for having me
 
02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:24.570 align:start position:0%
I sincerely apologize for my technical
 
02:09:28.399 --> 02:09:28.409 align:start position:0%
difficulties earlier in the meeting but
 
02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:30.650 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to join now and no need to
 
02:09:35.709 --> 02:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
apologize and we moved through this
 
02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your patience of
 
02:09:41.899 --> 02:09:41.909 align:start position:0%
course and thank you for yours I love to
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
be able to open for the record my name
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
is Donna kajoor and I do represent the
 
02:09:48.169 --> 02:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elo network as the former
 
02:09:50.569 --> 02:09:50.579 align:start position:0%
president I worked with our current
 
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
leadership team to draft our testimony
 
02:09:56.050 --> 02:09:56.060 align:start position:0%
today so that was provided in writing
 
02:09:59.240 --> 02:09:59.250 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to just step in and echo
 
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
what senator Kahn and senator deechi had
 
02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:06.210 align:start position:0%
already testified to we as at the
 
02:10:10.459 --> 02:10:10.469 align:start position:0%
network wholeheartedly believe that the
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
school has the an important role to play
 
02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
in allowing students the flexibility and
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
support to be successful in these work
 
02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
based learning type activities these
 
02:10:29.050 --> 02:10:29.060 align:start position:0%
alternative opportunities for students
 
02:10:32.899 --> 02:10:32.909 align:start position:0%
we've gone so far as to create a high
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
quality framework for our yolo
 
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
coordinators around the state which is
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
very rigorous and provides guidance to
 
02:10:45.979 --> 02:10:45.989 align:start position:0%
our Yolo coordinators in from anything
 
02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:48.210 align:start position:0%
from the partners that should be
 
02:10:50.359 --> 02:10:50.369 align:start position:0%
involved in heal in an elo the
 
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
monitoring the assessment all the way to
 
02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:54.870 align:start position:0%
monitoring the assessment all the way to
awarding

02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
awarding
 
02:10:57.719 --> 02:10:57.729 align:start position:0%
but what it also allows for is the
 
02:11:00.899 --> 02:11:00.909 align:start position:0%
flexibility for districts to respond
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
based on the needs of their communities
 
02:11:05.429 --> 02:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
the values and graduation requirements
 
02:11:06.689 --> 02:11:06.699 align:start position:0%
that those individual districts
 
02:11:10.979 --> 02:11:10.989 align:start position:0%
districts have that being said we face
 
02:11:13.250 --> 02:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
as many of you have pointed out
 
02:11:16.469 --> 02:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
districts who do not have the resources
 
02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:18.550 align:start position:0%
available to hire full-time elo
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
coordinators now we have seen an uptick
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
in a and and we are we are adding more
 
02:11:26.609 --> 02:11:26.619 align:start position:0%
elo coordinators in a full-time capacity
 
02:11:30.509 --> 02:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
every year and that's really great but
 
02:11:32.279 --> 02:11:32.289 align:start position:0%
we still have districts who are who are
 
02:11:33.870 --> 02:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with that and so what we've
 
02:11:36.029 --> 02:11:36.039 align:start position:0%
created with our network are these
 
02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
regional regional networks where we have
 
02:11:43.290 --> 02:11:43.300 align:start position:0%
regional chairs appointed and they're
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
veteran elo staff members who can
 
02:11:48.089 --> 02:11:48.099 align:start position:0%
provide guidance and structure for those
 
02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:49.570 align:start position:0%
districts who don't necessarily have
 
02:11:52.319 --> 02:11:52.329 align:start position:0%
somebody full-time in place oftentimes
 
02:11:54.509 --> 02:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities are added to the
 
02:11:56.250 --> 02:11:56.260 align:start position:0%
plate of a school counselor or another
 
02:11:59.040 --> 02:11:59.050 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher or the like and so we
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
are trying to provide those structures a
 
02:12:02.969 --> 02:12:02.979 align:start position:0%
statewide that are gonna support
 
02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:06.610 align:start position:0%
districts to carry these out it you know
 
02:12:09.330 --> 02:12:09.340 align:start position:0%
when we first heard about learn
 
02:12:12.449 --> 02:12:12.459 align:start position:0%
everywhere it was disappointing to see
 
02:12:14.850 --> 02:12:14.860 align:start position:0%
that that level of support from a
 
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:18.340 align:start position:0%
school's perspective was missing and we
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
can provide you with a number of
 
02:12:22.469 --> 02:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
examples as to why but I think the
 
02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:24.610 align:start position:0%
bottom line is students don't
 
02:12:26.669 --> 02:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily enter these work based
 
02:12:28.469 --> 02:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
learning experiences with the skills to
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
navigate them effectively and so the
 
02:12:32.339 --> 02:12:32.349 align:start position:0%
whole point of engaging in these
 
02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:34.389 align:start position:0%
experiences is to make sure that they're
 
02:12:35.850 --> 02:12:35.860 align:start position:0%
developing those skills throughout the
 
02:12:37.919 --> 02:12:37.929 align:start position:0%
process and so I'm referring to things
 
02:12:40.379 --> 02:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
beyond the skills required to do the job
 
02:12:42.569 --> 02:12:42.579 align:start position:0%
I'm referring also to those soft skills
 
02:12:44.879 --> 02:12:44.889 align:start position:0%
and so we repeatedly meet with those
 
02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
students on a regular basis to discuss
 
02:12:49.429 --> 02:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
things like you know problem-solving
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
communication teamwork something it
 
02:12:55.439 --> 02:12:55.449 align:start position:0%
could be something as simple as how do I
 
02:12:57.629 --> 02:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
talk to my supervisor about questions I
 
02:13:00.449 --> 02:13:00.459 align:start position:0%
have or how do I address a confrontation
 
02:13:03.689 --> 02:13:03.699 align:start position:0%
I encountered so those kinds of things
 
02:13:06.389 --> 02:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
are absent from the process of approval
 
02:13:08.250 --> 02:13:08.260 align:start position:0%
and without the sub
 
02:13:09.899 --> 02:13:09.909 align:start position:0%
part of the network and the structures
 
02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
we've put in place for Regions I don't
 
02:13:14.370 --> 02:13:14.380 align:start position:0%
know how other schools will be able to
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
navigate them if students bypass the
 
02:13:19.919 --> 02:13:19.929 align:start position:0%
school and go directly to the business
 
02:13:21.839 --> 02:13:21.849 align:start position:0%
or industry to seek out these
 
02:13:21.849 --> 02:13:22.770 align:start position:0%
or industry to seek out these
experiences

02:13:22.770 --> 02:13:22.780 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
02:13:26.399 --> 02:13:26.409 align:start position:0%
it lends itself to a whole host of
 
02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
liability issues we also as a network
 
02:13:33.689 --> 02:13:33.699 align:start position:0%
are pretty stringent on how we guide our
 
02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
elo coordinators and programmers to make
 
02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:38.500 align:start position:0%
sure those employees and those business
 
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:41.110 align:start position:0%
industry partners are vetted we go
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
through Department of Labor process for
 
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:46.510 align:start position:0%
that and some districts go beyond that
 
02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:48.610 align:start position:0%
and and do and have a number of other
 
02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:50.590 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place to make sure that
 
02:13:52.529 --> 02:13:52.539 align:start position:0%
those students are vetted that being
 
02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:55.300 align:start position:0%
said if a business is approved through
 
02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:58.570 align:start position:0%
those processes it is still on the point
 
02:14:00.930 --> 02:14:00.940 align:start position:0%
of the elo coordinator to make sure that
 
02:14:03.479 --> 02:14:03.489 align:start position:0%
that is the best fit for that particular
 
02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
student and that's only done on a
 
02:14:07.709 --> 02:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
one-to-one basis and so if for example
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
if it's if a larger industry or business
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
partner is approved yet a smaller
 
02:14:15.299 --> 02:14:15.309 align:start position:0%
environment a more intimate environment
 
02:14:17.339 --> 02:14:17.349 align:start position:0%
is better for this student that's
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
something an elo coordinator will know
 
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:21.730 align:start position:0%
and be able to help that student guide
 
02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:23.710 align:start position:0%
through so these are again just some
 
02:14:26.189 --> 02:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
examples that I that we can speak to
 
02:14:30.089 --> 02:14:30.099 align:start position:0%
where we feel it is in vital for the
 
02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:32.860 align:start position:0%
school to be a part of this process and
 
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:36.010 align:start position:0%
moreover we feel it really necessary for
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to help
 
02:14:41.729 --> 02:14:41.739 align:start position:0%
leverage these resources and provide the
 
02:14:44.459 --> 02:14:44.469 align:start position:0%
support so that we can we can continue
 
02:14:46.049 --> 02:14:46.059 align:start position:0%
to provide the professional development
 
02:14:48.089 --> 02:14:48.099 align:start position:0%
and support to our districts in in
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
navigating these experiences for their
 
02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:54.570 align:start position:0%
students terrific thank you very much
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
miss couture questions on this testimony
 
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:02.380 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee represent
 
02:15:06.299 --> 02:15:06.309 align:start position:0%
core delhi mr. chairman and thank you
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
for being here i'm just curious with
 
02:15:12.209 --> 02:15:12.219 align:start position:0%
your explanation of the the network and
 
02:15:17.129 --> 02:15:17.139 align:start position:0%
all how is it that we only have 2% of
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
the eligible students receiving credits
 
02:15:26.279 --> 02:15:26.289 align:start position:0%
laws well I can't speak to that that
 
02:15:28.770 --> 02:15:28.780 align:start position:0%
number and and where that came from I
 
02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:31.690 align:start position:0%
can say that there is some conflict with
 
02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:35.099 align:start position:0%
the data that the Department of Ed
 
02:15:39.959 --> 02:15:39.969 align:start position:0%
currently has and is using to gauged elo
 
02:15:42.899 --> 02:15:42.909 align:start position:0%
implementation across the state we've
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
had some other sources of data that is
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
again conflicting to that so so I'm not
 
02:15:51.089 --> 02:15:51.099 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily speak to the two
 
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:53.590 align:start position:0%
percent of our students I will say this
 
02:15:58.500 --> 02:15:58.510 align:start position:0%
however there is a lack of cohesion
 
02:16:02.339 --> 02:16:02.349 align:start position:0%
between for example the data and how we
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
capture it in terms of students who
 
02:16:07.649 --> 02:16:07.659 align:start position:0%
engage in things like CTE our our career
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
tech ed programs and the work based
 
02:16:11.609 --> 02:16:11.619 align:start position:0%
learning that goes along with that as
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
well as students who are engaging in
 
02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:17.260 align:start position:0%
yellos and even if you throw in online
 
02:16:19.529 --> 02:16:19.539 align:start position:0%
learning in the mix I think that it
 
02:16:23.339 --> 02:16:23.349 align:start position:0%
leaves a lot of confusion in terms of
 
02:16:24.689 --> 02:16:24.699 align:start position:0%
how it's reported and how that's
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
determined now that all being said I
 
02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:28.690 align:start position:0%
think that we have we do have a long way
 
02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:30.550 align:start position:0%
to go in terms of supporting our
 
02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:33.250 align:start position:0%
districts but I do not think by any
 
02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:35.710 align:start position:0%
means that we are going to get there
 
02:16:37.259 --> 02:16:37.269 align:start position:0%
through they learn everywhere initiative
 
02:16:39.179 --> 02:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
I think what we the way to get to
 
02:16:41.669 --> 02:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
increasing access for students in these
 
02:16:44.849 --> 02:16:44.859 align:start position:0%
programs is to support our districts so
 
02:16:47.009 --> 02:16:47.019 align:start position:0%
you know specifically those districts
 
02:16:48.809 --> 02:16:48.819 align:start position:0%
who can't afford or don't have the
 
02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:51.460 align:start position:0%
resources to provide a full time elo
 
02:16:53.519 --> 02:16:53.529 align:start position:0%
coordinator we need to be able to work
 
02:16:54.809 --> 02:16:54.819 align:start position:0%
with the structures they do have in
 
02:16:56.519 --> 02:16:56.529 align:start position:0%
place to support these programs
 
02:16:59.759 --> 02:16:59.769 align:start position:0%
alternatively and and so there's methods
 
02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:02.830 align:start position:0%
to do that and I think I just do not see
 
02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:04.750 align:start position:0%
how they learn everywhere program will
 
02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:09.580 align:start position:0%
get us there additional questions for
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
Miss Couture going once going twice
 
02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:20.050 align:start position:0%

testimony but they are here and they did
 
02:17:51.090 --> 02:17:51.100 align:start position:0%
submit testimony perhaps if the NEA New
 
02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:52.930 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative could raise
 
02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:53.890 align:start position:0%
their hand if they would like to
 
02:17:59.130 --> 02:17:59.140 align:start position:0%

pass from representative Tanner and

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:01.770 align:start position:0%

to speak to your motion Tamerlane okay
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I think this bill is a
 
02:25:19.809 --> 02:25:19.819 align:start position:0%
great compromise bill it as
 
02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:22.580 align:start position:0%
representative Deaton Conn
 
02:25:24.769 --> 02:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
representatives senators Conn and each
 
02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
both spoke to this bill actually takes
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
and rewards the ELO program and tries to
 
02:25:36.019 --> 02:25:36.029 align:start position:0%
expand it by allowing the role of the
 
02:25:38.149 --> 02:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and the Department of
 
02:25:42.050 --> 02:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
Education to oversee to develop this
 
02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:45.270 align:start position:0%
list and vet vendors and at the same
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
time it allows the local school
 
02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
districts to remain in control of their
 
02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:55.050 align:start position:0%
credits for graduation I think talking
 
02:25:56.719 --> 02:25:56.729 align:start position:0%
to the school districts in my eight
 
02:26:00.979 --> 02:26:00.989 align:start position:0%
towns all of them really think that
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
these alternative education experiences
 
02:26:08.109 --> 02:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
are vital they really would like to see
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
and promote those experiences within
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
their school resources both at the
 
02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:17.130 align:start position:0%
parent level and resources at the school
 
02:26:19.639 --> 02:26:19.649 align:start position:0%
level often are restrictive and that's
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's one of the areas that we really
 
02:26:25.219 --> 02:26:25.229 align:start position:0%
need to work on but I think it's it's a
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
great bill and and I encourage everybody
 
02:26:29.591 --> 02:26:29.601 align:start position:0%
to support
 
02:26:32.451 --> 02:26:32.461 align:start position:0%
thank you represent inner representative
 
02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:35.910 align:start position:0%
Lane would you like to to add to I'm
 
02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
sure I just am just a point I am was on
 
02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
the North Hampton school board and heard
 
02:26:43.970 --> 02:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
of the co-operative women come in high
 
02:26:47.091 --> 02:26:47.101 align:start position:0%
school board when the elo program was in
 
02:26:50.961 --> 02:26:50.971 align:start position:0%
development here and I saw just the
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous effect that it has had on our
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
students in our community and bringing
 
02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:00.570 align:start position:0%
the community into the school and I also
 
02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:04.190 align:start position:0%
have to compliment the school system on
 
02:27:07.341 --> 02:27:07.351 align:start position:0%
creating an atmosphere of inclusion
 
02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:12.750 align:start position:0%
around all of their appointments so I I
 
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
I know things sometimes start slowly and
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
can evolve and I see this is a great
 
02:27:20.511 --> 02:27:20.521 align:start position:0%
step forward from where we're at right
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much for episode of
 
02:27:26.841 --> 02:27:26.851 align:start position:0%
leg are there other members of the
 
02:27:28.671 --> 02:27:28.681 align:start position:0%
committee that would like to share their
 
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
thoughts on Senate bill 514 I see
 
02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.430 --> 02:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chair
 
02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
I think representative Ladd's initial
 
02:27:46.761 --> 02:27:46.771 align:start position:0%
comments echoed some of my concerns
 
02:27:49.881 --> 02:27:49.891 align:start position:0%
about the bill in terms of the confusion
 
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
about rulemaking and the proof list
 
02:28:04.371 --> 02:28:04.381 align:start position:0%
maintained by the ball referenced
 
02:28:07.791 --> 02:28:07.801 align:start position:0%
anywhere the data we received my
 
02:28:10.430 --> 02:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
Regional School District did not have
 
02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:13.950 align:start position:0%
one student receiving credits and I
 
02:28:15.621 --> 02:28:15.631 align:start position:0%
think if you ask the taxpayers around
 
02:28:21.591 --> 02:28:21.601 align:start position:0%
either money is not the issue so I am
 
02:28:25.511 --> 02:28:25.521 align:start position:0%
firmly against this bill and any
 
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
revisions to the language that is
 
02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:35.190 align:start position:0%
currently in statute further further
 
02:28:36.890 --> 02:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
thought some members of the committee
 
02:28:41.739 --> 02:28:41.749 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.079 --> 02:28:47.089 align:start position:0%
preserve land yeah this thank you very
 
02:28:48.909 --> 02:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
much representative this would be a good
 
02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:52.099 align:start position:0%
bill if you deleted everything that's
 
02:28:54.069 --> 02:28:54.079 align:start position:0%
new in the bill and just left it the way
 
02:28:54.849 --> 02:28:54.859 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:28:56.949 --> 02:28:56.959 align:start position:0%
after graduation putting a period there
 
02:28:59.889 --> 02:28:59.899 align:start position:0%
and be done with it leave the bill the
 
02:29:03.549 --> 02:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
law the way it is it can work it is
 
02:29:07.149 --> 02:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
working however it just seems to be a
 
02:29:10.119 --> 02:29:10.129 align:start position:0%
turf battle between some that are in the
 
02:29:16.659 --> 02:29:16.669 align:start position:0%
schools right now and in those that in
 
02:29:20.079 --> 02:29:20.089 align:start position:0%
an allowing credit from other avenues
 
02:29:24.629 --> 02:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
online community work all that should be
 
02:29:28.239 --> 02:29:28.249 align:start position:0%
accepted if in fact the students meet
 
02:29:30.819 --> 02:29:30.829 align:start position:0%
competencies and you know we moved into
 
02:29:32.649 --> 02:29:32.659 align:start position:0%
this competency education and quite
 
02:29:35.439 --> 02:29:35.449 align:start position:0%
frankly over over the last year from the
 
02:29:37.359 --> 02:29:37.369 align:start position:0%
way we voted on several I just wonder
 
02:29:39.399 --> 02:29:39.409 align:start position:0%
really if we truly believe in
 
02:29:44.609 --> 02:29:44.619 align:start position:0%
competencies thank you further thoughts
 
02:29:47.249 --> 02:29:47.259 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to share prior to
 
02:29:52.019 --> 02:29:52.029 align:start position:0%
prior to taking taking up the vote
 
02:29:56.949 --> 02:29:56.959 align:start position:0%

02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
being taken up sue is one of the
 
02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:41.550 align:start position:0%
sponsors on that bill so she's going to
 
02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:46.130 align:start position:0%
introduce it there's the House bill that
 
02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:51.510 align:start position:0%
created tuition free at UNH our
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%

02:34:54.761 --> 02:34:54.771 align:start position:0%

be introduced by representative roy and
 
02:35:08.270 --> 02:35:08.280 align:start position:0%

to you as well on that and and bump bump
 
02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
the third bill is is actually the
 
02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:21.390 align:start position:0%
the the bill which would correspond to
 
02:35:25.730 --> 02:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 5:14 its House bill Linda
 
02:35:27.650 --> 02:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm missing the I'm not guessing at
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
54 14:54 you're the prime on that and
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
and so Linda's going to introduce that
 
02:35:40.011 --> 02:35:40.021 align:start position:0%
in the house tomorrow and and so so
 
02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:44.190 align:start position:0%
please feel free to to connect up with
 
02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:46.650 align:start position:0%
that meeting put your put your name and
 
02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to testify either way
 
02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:51.630 align:start position:0%
these were these like I said bills that
 
02:35:55.130 --> 02:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
all came through this committee and and
 
02:35:57.050 --> 02:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
certainly two of those bills I think it
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
are very very strong bipartisan vote
 
02:36:04.570 --> 02:36:04.580 align:start position:0%
I think the there will be a number of
 
02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:08.250 align:start position:0%
amendments that are going to be going on
 
02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:13.050 align:start position:0%
to House bill is it's 1558 the bill that
 
02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:18.390 align:start position:0%
some for student services right and and
 
02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:22.170 align:start position:0%
so of those amendments I believe will
 
02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
include my understanding will include
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
the manifest hardship that
 
02:36:30.050 --> 02:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative loud night sponsor
 
02:36:32.570 --> 02:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
sponsored together and a number of other
 
02:36:39.020 --> 02:36:39.030 align:start position:0%
things so so anyway that's that's what I
 
02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:42.570 align:start position:0%
know Rick you got something yeah I just
 
02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:45.030 align:start position:0%
you know if anybody want is testifying
 
02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
one of our bills that coming out of our
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee but it's been added or the
 
02:36:52.011 --> 02:36:52.021 align:start position:0%
intent to add various amendments on
 
02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:53.550 align:start position:0%
remember when you're introducing a bill
 
02:36:56.690 --> 02:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
you're only introducing our bill right
 
02:36:58.850 --> 02:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing all those amendments
 
02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:00.630 align:start position:0%
you don't speak to those amendments in
 
02:37:03.350 --> 02:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
that process at that time that's right
 
02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:04.350 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:06.990 align:start position:0%
thanks for thanks for raising that so um
 
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
so know those those will be Senate
 
02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:12.210 align:start position:0%
amendments they may look work they may
 
02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:14.250 align:start position:0%
be word-for-word a bill that came
 
02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:16.530 align:start position:0%
through here but that's a that's a
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
senator that will be that will be
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
introducing that amendment to to a house
 
02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:24.630 align:start position:0%
built it obviously if you want to speak
 
02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:26.970 align:start position:0%
to the amendment even speaking to the
 
02:37:31.139 --> 02:37:31.149 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.909 --> 02:37:33.919 align:start position:0%
well I don't know Rick did how did they
 
02:37:35.469 --> 02:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
do it on what you're watching right now
 
02:37:38.050 --> 02:37:38.060 align:start position:0%
well you can't you can't add an
 
02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:40.310 align:start position:0%
amendment on a bill in a hearing right
 
02:37:42.849 --> 02:37:42.859 align:start position:0%
so it's gonna have to be an executive
 
02:37:46.539 --> 02:37:46.549 align:start position:0%
session so it really kind of locks us
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
out you we can speak to the bill as it
 
02:37:54.609 --> 02:37:54.619 align:start position:0%
came from us as you're the prime sponsor
 
02:37:58.479 --> 02:37:58.489 align:start position:0%
or the co-sponsor of and and that that
 
02:38:00.219 --> 02:38:00.229 align:start position:0%
you know or a committee member
 
02:38:01.899 --> 02:38:01.909 align:start position:0%
representing this committee at that
 
02:38:04.569 --> 02:38:04.579 align:start position:0%
meeting only on that portion of the bill
 
02:38:06.699 --> 02:38:06.709 align:start position:0%
because the rest of its not on the table
 
02:38:12.219 --> 02:38:12.229 align:start position:0%
yet so so I I think I'm sorry I just
 
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um there are some
 
02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:18.470 align:start position:0%
hearings on proposed amendments tomorrow
 
02:38:20.289 --> 02:38:20.299 align:start position:0%
so that will give you an opportunity
 
02:38:23.199 --> 02:38:23.209 align:start position:0%
those proposed amendments are speaking
 
02:38:25.869 --> 02:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
to the language you're talking about
 
02:38:27.519 --> 02:38:27.529 align:start position:0%
right yeah that that's what I was gonna
 
02:38:29.019 --> 02:38:29.029 align:start position:0%
bring up because I think like even the
 
02:38:32.649 --> 02:38:32.659 align:start position:0%
one o'clock bill of 1558 which where sue
 
02:38:35.829 --> 02:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
introduces it I think they've got that
 
02:38:37.239 --> 02:38:37.249 align:start position:0%
scheduled that one and then the
 
02:38:40.329 --> 02:38:40.339 align:start position:0%
amendment at five minutes later to have
 
02:38:42.250 --> 02:38:42.260 align:start position:0%
a hearing on that and that that has the
 
02:38:47.199 --> 02:38:47.209 align:start position:0%
manifest hardship and we build that I
 
02:38:50.949 --> 02:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
was dealing with today which is HB 1 2 3
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
4 1234
 
02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:55.310 align:start position:0%
there's over 70 different sections to
 
02:39:00.189 --> 02:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
that bill now and and so there's a lot
 
02:39:04.050 --> 02:39:04.060 align:start position:0%
to it it's almost looks like H before
 
02:39:07.329 --> 02:39:07.339 align:start position:0%
right where you have you know pages upon
 
02:39:12.399 --> 02:39:12.409 align:start position:0%
pages yep nope anybody else have
 
02:39:16.679 --> 02:39:16.689 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:19.850 align:start position:0%
all right well you know this has been a
 
02:39:21.789 --> 02:39:21.799 align:start position:0%
pleasure this has been a rare
 
02:39:26.559 --> 02:39:26.569 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to be with you all in a
 
02:39:30.189 --> 02:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
in a remote in a rowboat committee
 
02:39:33.039 --> 02:39:33.049 align:start position:0%
meeting and and I think we're one of the
 
02:39:36.069 --> 02:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
few committees that that's even you know
 
02:39:39.189 --> 02:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
had some bills to meet remotely on so so
 
02:39:41.439 --> 02:39:41.449 align:start position:0%
this is a I think a unique special
 
02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:44.330 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm
 
02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:46.450 align:start position:0%
personally looking forward to Thursday
 
02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
just to just to see people in person so
 
02:39:56.500 --> 02:39:56.510 align:start position:0%
I really I wish you all well be healthy
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
particularly be healthy on Thursday and
 
02:40:03.450 --> 02:40:03.460 align:start position:0%
