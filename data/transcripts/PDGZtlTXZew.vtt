00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
soon I am introducing CR r c excuse me c
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
C8 it's very it's mouthful um this is an
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
amendment a proposed amendment to the
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh that would prohibit the
 
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
legislature of New Hampshire from making
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
any new restrictions on the right to
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
keep and bear arms Beyond those which
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
are already or will be codified in
 
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.950 align:start position:0%
are already or will be codified in
federal

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
law the reason I'm introducing this bill
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
is because I've heard from many
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
constituents that they're frankly a
 
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
little tired of every two years or four
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
years or whatever it may be that um
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
power shifts in the state house that
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
they are concerned about either losing
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
or having their civil rights infringed
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
upon based on whatever political winds
 
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
are blowing and conquered now we all
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
have our beliefs on the Second Amendment
 
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
and I respect everyone's view on it um
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm representing my
 
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm representing my
constituents

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason I left the federal law
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
portion in there is because I'm also a
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
realist and I understand the federal
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
Supremacy so if the federal government
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
says in its ultimate wisdom that um you
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
can't have magazines more than 10 rounds
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
well that's the law of the land until
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
such time as we can get the Supreme
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
Court to rule
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise um but if it doesn't say that
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
that would restrict New Hampshire
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
legislators from making any laws for
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
example on 10 round magazines if it's
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
not restricted by the federal law we
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
can't touch it it would also prohibit in
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement from enforcing
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
any federal laws that ran a foul of our
 
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
own Constitution that allows us to keep
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
them bear arms for example if the
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
federal government decided that you know
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
what um we're not going to
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
allow semi-automatic handguns well the
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution would not agree
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
with that that and our law enforcement
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
could not enforce enforce that that
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the federal law enforcement
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
officers in New Hampshire couldn't
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
enforce it it just means that our law
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
enforcement could enforce it and again
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
the back to the original goal of this is
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
to keep people from having to worry
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
about their civil rights every time that
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature swings in conquered and
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
I hope that people who have a different
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
view of this will
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
consider the same thing happening with
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
um other civil rights that they are
 
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.149 align:start position:0%
um other civil rights that they are
concerned

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
with if every time you know the
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
Republicans took over we tried to take
 
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
away freedom of speech or the Press um
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
in contravening federal law your
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
constituents will be equally upset and
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
have to worry every time so that's the
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
the basis for me submitting this and I'm
 
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
questions representative testerman
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for taking
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
my question I was reading the the
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislation and and you're saying that
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
if the federal
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
government uh put a 10 pound limit on
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
magazines we would have to live with
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
can't can't we enact a a an agreement
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
that would uh or a law that would
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
preempt the federal government you know
 
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
there is that 10th Amendment that says
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
you know the states have rights
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little bit worrisome about
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
this I agree and if you know if if if I
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
had my brothers I would say yes but I'm
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
also a realist I understand how the the
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
system works and if they did enact such
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
a law um and the Supreme Court upheld it
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
um that we would really have no Avenue
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
we can pass all the laws you know saying
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to obey the federal
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
government all we want the only recourse
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
we have is to the Supreme Court and the
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court finds it
 
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional and it applies to the
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
states um you know it our law isn't
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
worth the paper it's printed on so my
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
goal was to try and um keep this
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
realistic um there are many states out
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
there and I admire them for doing so
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
that have made themselves so-called
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment Sanctuary States and if
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
we could that'd be great but in the real
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
world if the United States Supreme Court
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
says that a federal law is
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional and it applies to the
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
states our Sanctuary law really just
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any power so I I understand
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
your concerned representative Testament
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm with you but I'm trying to I was
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
trying to keep this realistic for
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.990 align:start position:0%
you representative
[Music]

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
n thank you chairman and thank you
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I'm glad you brought
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
up taking away people's rights every two
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
years and uh based off of the concern of
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
the political climate and conquered and
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
how it's not fair to our people and how
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
we would feel if that would happen to us
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
every two years and I have to say that I
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
think this pales in comparison to taking
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
away the right to being able to choose
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
on my own person my own body what I can
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
do with my own health I think that you
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
still have the right to bear arms and
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
protect yourself no in this state is
 
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.829 align:start position:0%
protect yourself no in this state is
that

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
correct um if your is your question do
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative N I just ask you I
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
recognize you for a followup but not not
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
to State
 
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
questions okay I I withdraw thank you
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
that was good
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.269 align:start position:0%
that was good
enough

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
the the wording in the actual uh in the
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
actual bill seems to be broader than
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
what you described it says that any
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
federal law that infringes upon rights
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in the New Hampshire
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution shall be unenforceable by
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement um any any
 
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.870 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement um any any
federal

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.110 align:start position:0%
federal
law

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
um are are you suggesting that it ites
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
it applies more to to more than to this
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh particular Amendment of the
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution in other words are you
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting any federal law that has
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with Firearms is that what
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're asking it would appear to be that
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
broad um well considering where it's
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
placed um in the in the amendment of The
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution um I would assume a court
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
would would rightfully infer that that's
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
what it's talking about
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
um but representative M I'd be happy for
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
you to submit an amendment to narrow
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
that to just gun laws if that's how you
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
how you
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
question um if the Supreme Court were to
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
um say that your second amendment that
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
second Amendment Sanctuary laws are
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional what effect would that
 
00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
have on this this amendment to the
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution um the effect on it I I I
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
suppose would be that um it we would
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
still be limited from passing laws that
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
that were stricter than the federal law
 
00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:51.629 align:start position:0%
that were stricter than the federal law
but

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it wouldn't have any effect
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
on it because that's the way I wrote it
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
so that federal law still uh was
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme so if they say for
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
example um federal law is that you can't
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
have anything more than a 10 round
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
magazine this amendment to our
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
constitution would prohibit us from
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
making a law stricter than that saying
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
you can't have anything more than an
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
eight round magazine but anything that
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
we put in the Constitution it said well
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
no we we're going to disregard that um
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
would really be a null law it be moved
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
because the Supreme Court courts ruling
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
constitution um is what it is and the
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
only way to overcome that would be to
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
pass a Constitutional
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the US
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
B than chairman thank you for uh
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm a little
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
concerned uh about
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are federal laws right
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
now that that restrict the uh carrying
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
of firearms on school property for
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
example uh to only uh people that have
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh weapon
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
permits um but our state laws sort of
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
perid school officials as well as
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh parties from um restricting any uh uh
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
Firearms regulations is that not true
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and uh uh does that mean that those laws
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
out well so currently uh you are correct
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
federal law says that no one can carry a
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
firearm on school property unless
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're license to carry a firearm we
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
have legislation that says that U the
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
state has the um ultimate Authority and
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
sold jurisdiction to pass firearm laws
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
so that school boards and and towns Etc
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
cannot enact their own firearms laws I
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
do not think that wor this to pass that
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
that would matter
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
um because they already
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
can't do am I answering your question
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
right in other words this doesn't affect
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
a law that says no one below us can pass
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
already representative bour you
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
recognized for a followup question thank
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um actually you basically
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
said in your testimony that if the uh
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal government passed a law that
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
restricted the number of uh uh whether
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
you could have a automatic uh pistol or
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
not uh then the state would have to
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
enforce that law would have to abide by
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
that law since federal laws already are
 
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
more restrictive on uh uh use of fair
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
the car regulation of firearms on schol
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
property would not not also mean that
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
those laws are no longer
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
valid uh I think I I think I understand
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
your question but I don't think your
 
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
premise is correct currently um there is
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
no New Hampshire law that cont
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
intervenes federal law federal law says
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
that you cannot carry a firearm on
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
school property unless you're licensed
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
to do so if a school board decides that
 
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
they want to make a law that says you
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
can't carry a firearm even if you have a
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
license um that's what's prohibited
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
right now by New Hampshire law they're
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
not allowed to pass laws um regarding
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
firearms on on school property um so the
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law follows federal law right
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
now with regards to having to be
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
property I'm happy to take another one
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
from representative board n because he
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
looks like I'm we're still not getting
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
to the heart of his question if that's
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
likees we are uh as a practice of the
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
committee we we're doing our best to rep
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
limit members of the commit to two
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
questions per witness due to
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
time well I'm I'm sorry representative
 
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
boord if I didn't get that one email me
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
respond do you
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
have a third fall question you wish to
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
ask um just a point
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh speak we have we're having trouble
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
hearing you so it is in the discre to
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
allow a third question but I I actually
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear your second first or
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
second question so I'm gonna allow a
 
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
third question try to speak
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
up okay so
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
federal law already prohibits the the
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
use the carrying of firearms on school
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
property unless you have a concealed uh
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
permit yes however uh local law
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement is unable to uh enforce
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
those laws only federal law enforcement
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
correct um I I do not believe that is
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
correct I I believe that um
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
for example here here's another example
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
sought off shotguns are illegal under
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal law so are machine guns um I I
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
believe a law enforcement officer can
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
yeah seeing No Hands raised I want to

Tracy hbet and I'm here on behalf of
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
myself and the Kent Street coalition
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
working group on gun violence prevention
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
which I lead thank you for allowing me
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
to address the committee today um I will
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
make this very short um in terms of
 
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.269 align:start position:0%
make this very short um in terms of
public

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
policy um it's hard to think of a worse
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
idea than adopting a blanket prohibition
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
on any type of measure whatsoever that
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
might improve safety with regard to
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
Firearms or frankly anything else um I
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
do understand that some of us want less
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
government than others but it is a
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest and function
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
government to look after the health and
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
safety of that government's people and
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
to wholly exempt Firearms which are
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
um deadly weapons um from the purview of
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
all future laws um frankly to me is
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
nonsensical um and I will just add um
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
that I do understand the frustration
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
with having to revisit um every two
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
years um a certain body of Law and and
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
frankly it's a it's a frustration that
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
um we share frequently um but that is
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and nobody
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
understands that better than than all of
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
you sitting um as a legislative body uh
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
and that's simply the nature of of the
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
lawmaking process
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
um people do get shot and killed in New
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um despite what's
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
frequently um all the testimony that
 
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
that we hear and all the words that we
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
hear about New Hampshire being such a
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
safe State some of those people do die
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
in particular the rate of suicide has
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
risen in a striking manner over the past
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
decade we do need gun violence
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
prevention laws because it turns out
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
that they do save lives so let's debate
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
the merits of individual proposals
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
instead of blanket and frankly
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional measures like this one
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
um and I don't have any more time so I
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
can't get into that but thank you for
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony seeing No
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%

witness calling the next witness uh

Association and so many medical
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
Societies in the country uh that are
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
interested in gun violence prevention
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I'd be glad to provide the committee

with the 75 or more societies if
anybody's

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
anybody's
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
interested I'm here to express my grave
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction with this proposed
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and to the many attempts this
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
year and other years to propose gun
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
bills that interfere with the US and
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
state governments attempt to reign in
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
gun violence in this country rather this
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill and others unfortunately Foster gun
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
violence in our country and in New
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be frank I feel that the
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
Republican party is mostly lock step in
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to sane attempts to curtail
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
gun violence and to provide for safety
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
society these efforts fa fly in the face
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
of two key facts fact number one
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
numerous Studies have demonstrated that
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
loose gun laws are associated with more
 
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
loose gun laws are associated with more
gun

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
gun
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
violence and reasonable gun laws
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
restricting gun violence are associated
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
with less gun violence less murders less
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
suicides by guns and less gun injuries
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
the second fact is that the US has
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 times the gun violence
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
and here I'm referring specifically to
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
homicide but also um suicide of other
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
Western democracies relative to
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
guns let me close this brief testimony
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
encouraging all representatives to vote
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
to oppose this amendment and to be on
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
the side of sanity and safety in our
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
communities in our state and throughout
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
our country one further
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
comment proponents of this Amendment
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
state that they are concerned regarding
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
civil rights rights namely their concern
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
of expansion of interpretations of the
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Rel related to the Second
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment however the Civil Right of
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
being alive and safe in our state safe
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
to remain alive safe to vote safe to
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
breathe safe from being shot is clearly
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
more necessary than focusing only on
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
having more guns everywhere please vote
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
against this violence prone legislation
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
let us have a state and Country focused
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
on love and caring for others thank you
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%

Romero can you hear me yes we can thank
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning uh members of the
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing my
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
testimony um I have also uh submitted
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony which I hope was
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
passed out to you um I am against this
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
amendment because for the following
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
reasons it unnecessarily pits New
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law against federal law
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
and sets a negative
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
precedent in vetoing proposed gun
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
legislation last year Governor n sinunu
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
said that the New Hampshire uh
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I quote provides what
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
many believe believe to be more
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
expansive legal protections for gun
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
ownership than the Second Amendment to
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
Constitution the right to keep and bear
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
arms in New Hampshire um cutting off
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
debate on gun rights by limiting the
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
ability to pass gun safety laws which
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
silence the many New Hampshire residents
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
who believe and want sensible gun laws
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment ignores the fact
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
that gun violence in this country is a
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
significant Public Health crisis and a
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
leasing cause of premature death the
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment is overly restrictive
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the intent of silencing a much
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
needed conversation on sensible gun
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
safety laws this is not how democracy
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
works I wanted to to um uh add the uh
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
representative pres presenting the bill
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
talked about people worrying about their
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
civil rights I quite frankly am more
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
worried about my physical safety if this
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment were to be passed and I think
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's time that we prioritize physical
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
safety I also wanted to mention that in
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
other rooms this morning there is
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about the sanctity of the
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
pre mro uh we have to limit testimony to
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%

conclude your testimony yes yes um so
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%

00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the the sanctity of the life
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
pre-born um and there's less discussion
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
on the sanctity of those of us who are
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%

conquered high school and I'm
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire High
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
schoool Democrats we are deeply
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
ccr8 um because it would prohibit the
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
legislature from enacting Common Sense
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
gun control laws and doing
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:29.149 align:start position:0%
gun control laws and doing
so

00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I cut out can you hear me yes
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
great um gun control is a public safety
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
issue and we are terrified about the
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
amendment as a student I'm also keenly
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that there aren't
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
enough Common Sense gun control laws in
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the first place when
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
students walk into school one of the
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
first instinct is to see where the best
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
place would be to hide in the event of
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
an active shooter scenario
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
this is not an abstract fear because we
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
were trained on gun related lockdown
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
drills before we could write our own
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
names I hope that members of this
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
committee consider the safety and
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
well-being of students and other Granite
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing your hands raised the
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:32.549 align:start position:0%

Dunbarton I am here to testify in favor
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the concept but not the language of
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
this bill the current language has
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
significant unintended
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
consequences I would like to see a bill
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
that goes for forward that doesn't have
 
00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.710 align:start position:0%
that goes for forward that doesn't have
those

00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
consequences um we've heard from
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
numerous members of the New Hampshire
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms Coalition about the need for a
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
second amendment Sanctuary State and
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
this is potentially the right vehicle to
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
do that but the language that has been
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
drafted and submitted um has some
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
technical issues so we myself as well as
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
stand in support of the concept but not
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily the language that is in this
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%

representative and former chairman of
constitutional

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
review The Proposal you have before you
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
for a constitutional amendment is
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
good-hearted it's of good intent however
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
we must remember that when we are
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
putting things into the Constitution
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
particular particularly the Bill of
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
Rights they should be uh general
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
concepts broad Concepts and not
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
particulars uh when you get into
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
particulars you tend to forget something
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
so um I've been working on a a better
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
wording with uh uh former representative
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hull and I think that that we have
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
something that is uh up to the task but
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
I want you to remember that what you are
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
not talking about here is is not
 
00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:27.309 align:start position:0%
not talking about here is is not
particularly

00:39:27.309 --> 00:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
gun rights or the Firearms rights but it
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
is the most fundamental of our natural
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
rights the right of
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
self-defense and the access to the tools
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
necessary for that
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
self-defense and the defense of
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
others uh it is for this purpose that we
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
enter into
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
government and we delegate uh certain of
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
these powers to the government but the
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
government cannot always be there
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
when you're alone at night on the road
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh the government is not going to be
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
there when you're asleep in your bed the
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
government is not going to be
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
there you need to have EV every
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
individual needs to have
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
guarantee of their rights to defend
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
themselves from all attackers uh i' be
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing No Hands raised
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
M uh Mr chair am I recognized yes my
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
mistake representa so one of the
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've heard from some of
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
the other folks testifying is the fact
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill uh would also silence
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
debate on this issue uh and we have
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
another constitutional issue that we
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
need to to worry about here uh simply
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
aside from the the freedom to really
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
carry firearms I guess as somebody who
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
has worked on constitutional issues in
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature how do you respond to
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
that well I assume that that because you
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
compe issue you felt raised as one of uh
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
right of freedom of speech or debate uh
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
it certainly doesn't does not silence
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
debate um the question the question
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
question at hand would be how you
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
adequately protect
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals um who feel themselves at
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
Danger from such a proposal you have to
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
remember that what those people are
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
fearing is Criminal
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%

regardless what you need to maintain is
 
00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
the ability to punish those who uh
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%

00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%

Bo ex the room actually could hear his

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
exess see any members have any
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
additional questions seeing No Hands
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
rice Mr chairman I I apologize for those
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
earlier technical
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties um Mr chairman uh members
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
is Allan rice and I am a legal resident
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
of Bedford New Hampshire and I am here
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
as the state director for Gun Owners of
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
America a National Organization
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
representing over two million Firearms
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
owners I had sent the committee uh a
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
letter explaining our concerns with
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
ca8 um we believe the way this is
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
written if it were to be enacted as
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
written um it would actually set New
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire up for more gun control um
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not gun bans but certainly gun
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
taxes because the language says um that
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
would create a greater burden than that
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
in federal law federal law currently
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
taxes handguns at 10% rifle shot
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
shotguns and ammunition at 11% New
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could tax them at 9% and 10%
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
respectively and that would not be a
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
greater burden um so unless this is
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
amended um and that language is stricken
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh we would be forced uh to oppose CAC
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
um right now we're neutral and hoping
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
that this committee through its wisdom
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
and Collective knowledge would amend it
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
um but uh in response to the people who
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
were claiming Mayhem and blood would
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
happen um I would say look at
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional carry they predicted that
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
and we have not had any problems over
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
the past four years so they're just
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
factually wrong I believe I'm under time
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
rice seeing No Hands raised the witness
 
00:45:53.319 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
rice seeing No Hands raised the witness

00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
sub subsection three something direct L
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
conduct saying that U display firearm
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
shall not constitute repace conduct
 
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
under this
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
section that's a gist of the
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill this is something will save a lot
 
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.829 align:start position:0%
bill this is something will save a lot
of

00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
lives because as as we know um
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the United States defensive
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
use of a firearm or maybe just speaking
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
about it saves about 2.5 million lives
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
every year according to CDC
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
statistics so this is the gist of the
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
if if uh situation can be de escalated
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
if there's a conflict that may
 
00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:41.190 align:start position:0%
if there's a conflict that may
arise

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
arise
 
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.870 align:start position:0%
arise
hopefully

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
um telling them that you're serious
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
we'll calm things down and let everybody
 
00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
we'll calm things down and let everybody
go

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
peacefully and that's what my deal does
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%

00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%

00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
you to bring this legislation
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
board um Yes actually in New Hampshire I

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
instance where uh a lady was coming home
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
from work second
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
shift and uh she came under some sort of
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
an attack walk into the house and then
 
00:58:33.799 --> 00:58:34.950 align:start position:0%
an attack walk into the house and then
her

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
husband uh a woken in the middle of the
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
night ran downstairs trying to to help
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
her as he should have done and I commend
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
him for that I believe he he had he
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
grabbed a pistol to go investigate and
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
save his wife he probably was not
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
wearing holster probably was not the P
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
was probably not being holster he
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
probably just held it in his hand and he
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
may have not even be wearing pants at
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
that point and I believe he got into
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
some sort of trouble with the LA
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
because his firearm was not fer properly
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
he was just holding it trying to save
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
his wife so this hero should not be
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
facing any kind of criminal danger any
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
kind of charges because he was there to
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
done thank you thank
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
done thank you thank
you

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative I the chair has a
 
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.190 align:start position:0%
representative I the chair has a
question

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
so what I guess the term
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
display I read display to be it's
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
included in part of the definition of
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
Rip but it's not in
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
selfish what would you define our
 
00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.630 align:start position:0%
selfish what would you define our
understand

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.270 align:start position:0%
understand
displaying

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
displaying
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe it's defined in a
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
statute but it's a common English word
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
and when I looked it up in the
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
dictionary displ saying display were
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
meant to show or exhibit to make
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
in as opposed to be Reckless where you
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
have no intention you don't know what
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
witness yes yes yeah uh to display as
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
defined in the dictionary is to show or
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
visible that's not care that's not being
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
careless that's not being
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%

display I couldn't hear the um first
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
part I'm sorry you gave an example yes
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
of a man going to basically to protect
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
his wife yep that's not a display as
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
your your description gives so what
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
would you call that L this ple he had
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
his farming his hand
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
but for thank you okay but what was the
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
intent the intent M he was there to save
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
his wife okay thank you yeah represent
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative green thank you Mr chair
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
question if a person was on a highway
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
and there was about to become road rage
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
if he displayed his firearm this would
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh protect him as well as his family I
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
believe so and it would actually protect
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
the attackers too because they may think
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise and go elsewhere seeing that
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
they don't want to continue with the
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
confrontation it would deescalate the
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
confrontation I believe and he would
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
right his family himself would proceed
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you Mr chairman uh thank you

represent you for taken my question um
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
this seems like it's going to be that
 
01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:33.029 align:start position:0%
this seems like it's going to be that
you

01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
can banish a gun or point a gun at
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
anybody at at any time and it will not
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
be recess conduct am I
 
01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:45.950 align:start position:0%
be recess conduct am I
correct

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
um so the subsection I think you the
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
subsection um 631 colum 3 talks about
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct and that's not being
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
Reckless when you deliberately and
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
carefully something so U that's what dis
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
plan is uh again it is a verb it is to
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
show or exhibit something to make it
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
visible thank
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%

that talks about display of a firearm
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%

01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
you representative bur thank you Mr
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
for for coming
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
today if I'm understanding the bill
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
correctly if I'm walking down Elm Street
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and somebody jumps out of
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
a Alleyway and wants to threaten me and
 
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.990 align:start position:0%
a Alleyway and wants to threaten me and
my

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
wife and I feel instead of shoot
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
shooting them I just show my gun and
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
that will scare them away that is
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
acceptable but if I also want to drive
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
down the
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
road nobody's making me nervous or
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
anything and if I start just pointing my
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
gun this is what I'm being told is going
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
to happen is there a question
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman if I just
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
start pointing my gun there is also a
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
law against that your law is going to
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
protect my first scenario not my second
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
scenario of just driving down the road
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
people oh so is that correct that the
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
first part of my yes you know it's going
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
to protect me
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
but there is also other laws that will
 
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
stop B bad behavior like driving down
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
corre all right thank you sorry for
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
being confused and I'll just remind the
 
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
members uh I'm sure we're going to have
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
a very healthy discussion the executive
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
session and uh just I I already had warn

two members
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
equal

representative

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
news thank you for taking my question um
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
it it does appear to me that the
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
situation that you brought up based on
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
what representative Welch was saying is
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
actually covered uh in in New Hampshire
 
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.190 align:start position:0%
actually covered uh in in New Hampshire
law

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.789 align:start position:0%
law
um

01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
Mike what I'm curious about is is what
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
you think the impact of a bill like this
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
would be in a in a road rage
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
situation where normally two people
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
might get out of outside of a car um
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
yell at each other for a couple of
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
minutes um uh get it out of their system
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
jump back into the car and drive away uh
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody brandishes a gun or a
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
firearm and the other person uh is also
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
armed uh but maybe maybe armed so that
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're concealed does doesn't it seem
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
to you that that something like this
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
just opens the door for uh a much larger
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
extent of of potential gun violence on
 
01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:37.309 align:start position:0%
extent of of potential gun violence on
our

01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.069 align:start position:0%
our
roads

01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for the question well
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
this is America and we support and
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
defend the Second Amendment so you
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
should assume anybody should assume that
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
everybody is armed at all times to
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
display a firearm will just remind
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
people to warn them off they basically
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
from trying to escalate the
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
situation so I I believe this would
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
actually calm the situation down and all
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
let the people go peacefully because
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's just a reminder again this is
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
America this is not some other
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
place think so I believe that this will
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
situation repr
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
Bradley thank you and thank you for
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you mentioned
 
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so you mentioned
intent

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
can a display of a firearm cross into
 
01:08:27.719 --> 01:08:29.950 align:start position:0%
can a display of a firearm cross into
Reckless

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
Reckless
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
reckless Reckless uh would it cross
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
into display has deliberate um intent in
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
it you're trying to exhibit you're
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
trying to display it you're trying to
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
show it I'm
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
sorry you you're making it visible
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
Reckless is defined elsewhere um if it's
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
in the same sub paragraph but in the
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
dictionary if you look at
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
Reckless it's got little to do with
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
being displayed displays to make visible
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
Reckless is conduct where you don't care
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
about your actions where you beh
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
carelessly carelessly sorry um without
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
caution so reckless right so they are
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
separate different wordss basically this
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
hope just help guide the members of the
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee I believe in this won't appear
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
on what the the bill that was printed
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
out but RSA
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
631 uh three if you look at Roman one
 
01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of re so that
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%

my question
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative um you mentioned it's uh
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's more of a fear aspect and people
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to brandish a weapon
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
for intimidation and safety purposes
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
that way not necessarily using the
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
weapon is that
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
correct uh thank you for the for the

side and I don't suppose it'll ever be
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
but if somebody wants to show me their
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
firearm I'll be very happy about that I

you're saying these people don't
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be trained and
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're okay with an exorbitant amount of
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
public popul
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
other um thank you for the question I'm
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%

representative for taking my question
 
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware that in the uh 631 colon 3
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct the uh num Roman
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 says Reckless conduct is a
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
class B felony if they use a deadly
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
weapon and all other Reckless conduct is
 
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.950 align:start position:0%
weapon and all other Reckless conduct is
a

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor are you aware of that um

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
represent Newman you recognize for a
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
followup question thank you Mr chair um
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
do you believe that based on Roman
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 that this might be an o that
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent when this bill
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
when Reckless conduct was passed
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
intended to make uh the display of a gun
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
much more serious than any other form of
 
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.470 align:start position:0%
much more serious than any other form of
Reckless

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
Reckless
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.149 align:start position:0%
Reckless
conduct

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you it's um we I think we're
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think we're
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
confused in the two terms Reckless
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
conduct and displaying exhibiting
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
something an item are separate things
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
conduct is actually re as defined in
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
section one and in the dictionary it's
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
doing something where you're not
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about the consequences of an
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
action you're doing something without
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
caution you're doing something care
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
lessly displaying is an action where you
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
show an item where you exhibit an item
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
you have a you know what exactly what
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
Opposites thank
 
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.270 align:start position:0%
Opposites thank
you

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.990 align:start position:0%
you
representative

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
represent around expanding
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
selfdefense the vehicle um
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
and uh during the course of that
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard a number of scenarios
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
in which one would be then Justified to
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
use deadly
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
force um and among the scenarios was
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
somebody brandishing a weapon uh would
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
then be perceived as threatening which
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
would then allow for headden Force so if
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
people are then were inducing weapons uh
 
01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
as proposed under this
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
statute foresee potential problems in
 
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
statute foresee potential problems in
which

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
um instead of De escalating the
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
situation as it sounds like you're
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
intool thank you for the question good
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
question good question um so the vehicle
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
is a separate separate bill of mine um
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
so my intent there was that if you're
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
being kidnapped car jacked if you're
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
being stopped from leaving which is kind
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
of a being kidnapped if you cornered
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
something place you are able to use that
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
the force to get out of that situation
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
because in the vehicle you can not leave
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
all the time if you're surrounded by a
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
bunch of folks things like that so there
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
are you Defending Your
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
Life and you got to do what you got to
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
do you you may step on the guas and get
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
out try to get out even if you're trying
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
you know going to be falling off the
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
road something like
 
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.950 align:start position:0%
road something like
that

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's a separate deal of mind
 
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.629 align:start position:0%
um so that's a separate deal of mind
right

01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
um so being this doesn't talk about the
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles it doesn't talk about um being
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.910 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's see yeah so if we're talking
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
about the vehicle the purpose of the
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle is to go someplace point A to
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
point B so you're trying to get out of
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
the situation you again trying to
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
deescalate to do whatever is necessary
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
to deescalate
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
it if if you being threatened there's a
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
ises recogniz for follow question thank
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
your so would you agree we we also heard
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and I hate to keep referring
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
back to another bill but I do see them
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
as related um we heard testimony in
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
support of that bill from member of the
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
public support of that bill who clearly
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.910 align:start position:0%
public support of that bill who clearly
articulated

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
articulated
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
um witnessing someone brandish a weapon
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
at them as a threatening act that would
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
then um allow for a threatening or a
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
deadly force response so I guess um if
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh that would you agree with u that
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
person who spoke in favor of your other
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill and the concern that they
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
raised to
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
this um thank you for the question I
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
think uh there are two subsections in
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
the chapter one oh I'm sorry 631 col 3
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
where I'm I'm I'm trying to make changes
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
and 631 colum 4 which talks about I
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
think the scenario you're mentioning
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
where somebody is being attacked in a
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle and they have to figure out what
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do that deals with criminal
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
threatening that deals with uh let's see
 
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
yeah fear of being placed in I'm
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
sorry uh being placed in fear of iment
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
bodily injury or other things
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
so those are two separate subsections
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill so I think what you're getting into
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
is the criminal
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
conduct and that drugless conduct is
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
something different the criminal
 
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.950 align:start position:0%
something different the criminal
criminal

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior thank you see seeing No Hands
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
raised winess excl I want to thank you
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
for your tone taking our
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions I just I just want to remind
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
everyone so there is a legal difference
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
between displaying and Brin
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
isue I don't mean critique the question
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
I want say they've been used
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
interchangeably but there is a slight
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
difference so this only says displaying
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
mean I don't mean to be too technical
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make sure the public
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
understands that and if they may create
 
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.950 align:start position:0%
understands that and if they may create
confusion

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
with I think brandishing would involve
 
01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.709 align:start position:0%
with I think brandishing would involve
also

01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
displaying a firearm with the intent to
 
01:17:59.629 --> 01:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
threaten a person by without any just
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
legal justification for doing so
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
displaying is ma the int to actually one
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
you have a justification for doing two
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
you're not trying to Simply threaten or
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
intimidate someone without any just cuse
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's a distinguish that's why I when I
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
as my question what does he understand
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
display to me displaying is part
 
01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
display to me displaying is part
of

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
brid

01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.159 --> 01:18:29.550 align:start position:0%
 
peny

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
peny
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
Dean I just want to remind the members
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
of the public that their testimony will
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
minutes yes chairman thank you can you
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
hear me we can hear you okay thank you
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
um my name is Penny Dean and I'm an
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
attorney and I won't go through all the
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
places that I'm I'm admitted in but the
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
gist of this is is this is really
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
designed to give people a safe harbor
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
and to deescalate situations because
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of statistics by
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
Gary kleck who's a very famous Florida
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
criminologists and others that say the
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
simple display of a firearm Som
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes can diffuse a situation and
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
although I'm not speaking for the
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative that introduced this bill
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
I would expect that that's what this is
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
designed to do and it's also designed to
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
keep people having a safe harbor simply
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
displaying a firearm should not be a
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
criminal charge there are some people
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
who choose to carry concealed and
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes their clothing moves if
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
they're in a checkout line or whatever
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it's visible and the mere fact of
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
having a firearm present or what some
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
people could say displaying it in that
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
instance should not be a crime and so
 
01:19:39.719 --> 01:19:40.629 align:start position:0%
instance should not be a crime and so
this

01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
requires what someone would call
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
non-criminal behavior in other words
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
inadvertent Behavior or the deliberate
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
in some cases it can go both ways of
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
just showing another a firearm um and
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
and I would respectfully say this bill
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
is needed this bill is clarifying other
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
parts of the section and simply because
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
some people may not like or care for
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
firearms should not allow them to bring
 
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
cause the police to bring criminal
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
charges against those who choose to
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
carry a firearm for
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
if I just may ask one question you see
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
you probably heard me
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
discussing the term display what do you
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
understand the term
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
display displaying is simply to show or
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
maybe to make someone aware of um
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
displaying can also simply say to
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
pointing out or to draw attention to in
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
this particular context so it isn't the
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
pointing or threatening it is simply the
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
showing so in other words it isn't the
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
say case where I bring out a firearm and
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
say I say I'm going to shoot you or
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
point it at your head or do any any type
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
of other Behavior like this this is
 
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
simply showing or drawing attention to
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that you are carrying or
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
possessing a firearm it's not intended
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
to decriminalize criminal
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
Behavior thank you for taking my
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
question representative Hopper uh thank
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you attorney Dean
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you know
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
instances in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
where somebody has displayed a firearm
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
to do deescalate a situation has been uh
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
successfully prosecuted for doing so um
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
sadly I do sadly I do and um I think
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
this is needed to stop that and in many
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
many cases it destroys a person
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
financially it destroys them maybe
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
causes them to lose their job and many
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
many other things because the mere fact
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
that someone chooses to carry a firearm
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
in some particular occupations or
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
situations May chart um cause people to
 
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:05.719 align:start position:0%
say look look what they do so absolutely
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
this this is going to save a lot of I
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
prosecutions repr you recognize for a
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
fall question thank you Mr chair U Can
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
you email the committee
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
a couple examples if you have
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
them I could e um yeah I could email the
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
committee public examples um of other
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
people's cases there are some of my
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
cases that clients wouldn't want any
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
more attention drawn to but um I'm
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
trying to think of cases that would be
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
very clear let me think about that and I
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
will try to do that what's the timeline
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
for which when you would want to receive
 
01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.550 align:start position:0%
for which when you would want to receive
these

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.310 align:start position:0%
 
emails

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
emails
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
better always um um thank you I think
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
the one best example that we've heard
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
about was the ward bird example um
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
because for example there are times when
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
someone has a firearm either on their
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
holster again or carried somewhere else
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
at the mere shifting of their coat or
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
something someone will um allege that
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
this was designed to be a criminal act
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
that you just were showing me the
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
firearm to scare me when the person all
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
they did was simply shift a Cod or do
 
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
something else showing that they have a
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
firearm or inadvertently showing they
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
firearm representative Welsh attorney
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
de the difference between display and
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
brandishing what you agree is if you
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
remove the gun from the hster that's
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
brandishing if you leave it in the H and
 
01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
just open open your coat to show them
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
your arm that would be a dis is that
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
correct in general I would agree with
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
you in in general I would agree with you
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
um the only situation that I could see
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
where that might be and I'm just trying
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
to think of all scenarios but I in
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
general I absolutely agree with you the
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
only way I could see a different is
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of females who carry
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
firearms and not easily visible places
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
we might chose to then show them at a
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
given point but yes
 
01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.910 align:start position:0%
given point but yes
thank

01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
Muse thinking my question
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is is that this
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
is a method of deescalation appears to
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
be something uh right out of a wild west
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
movie so if if you and I are having a
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
disagreement and we're having a
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
passionate disagreement and you're on
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
one side of the table and I'm on the
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
other side of the table and you
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
take a gun out and you put it on top of
 
01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.270 align:start position:0%
take a gun out and you put it on top of
the

01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
table I I guess my my question is is how
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
does how does something like that
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
deescalate the situation es especially
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
if I have a
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
gun well first of all and this is one of
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
the biggest examples that I give people
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
is that um I attended gun owners in New
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire meetings for probably H 16 18
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
years no actually probably 20 years and
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
there are no more passionate dis
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
arguments and discussions than you will
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
see with gun owners who tend to be
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
opinionated never once did anyone use
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
their firearm to try and intimidate
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
another person or make a point and I'll
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee everyone in the room had one
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
or two guns on them and so to suggest
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
that gun owners are going to do that is
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate and and I think
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully incorrect in the sit
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
situation you're talking about we look
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
at what's called the totality of the
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances so if I were to say
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
something as well is doing that then
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
you've got a different situation but
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's not what this is dealing with
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with the displaying it
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
not the saying more because in the
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
situation you're talking about I
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
Envision the person saying something as
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
well as taking their firearm out and
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
putting it in between the two of us I
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
just don't see that as being protective
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
of criminal threatening behavior I don't
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
see this bill is taking away all the
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
other statutory protections we have for
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
what I call threatening behavior with
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
Firearms I think what you're suggesting
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that this now means people can engage
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
in criminal threatening and I would
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully say sir that's not the case
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
there are plenty other statutes that
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
deal with criminal threatening behavior
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
this is simply the showing of a firearm
 
01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
and it can be in a variety of situations
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't think what you're
 
01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.750 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't think what you're
talking

01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
about I think what you're talking about
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
will representative M you recognize for
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
a followup question thank you in your
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
opinion would a law like this make
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening uh more difficult
 
01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.030 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening uh more difficult
to

01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
prove I think what it does is clarify
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
what behavior is Criminal and what
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
behavior isn't Criminal because what has
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
happened with this law is you've had
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
more what I think
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
improper prosecutions and I'm and I
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
actually I'm thinking of a case right
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
now and it's the Stuart Yuri case that I
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
tried it came out of Milford and what
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
happened was finally after this person
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
had gone through I think three years of
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
trauma who knows how many legal fees
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
finally when the alleged complainants
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
got or the complaining Witnesses got on
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
the sand one admitted well he never
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
pointed at us and of course instantly
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the judge dismisses those charges but
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
until you can put these people on the
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
stand and narrow down exactly what the
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
person's alleged to have done I think
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
this is going to stop a lot of false
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutions prosecutions that should
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
not have been bought to begin with so I
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't see it as allowing criminal
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
threatening because I think of the Yuri
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
case we had two separate jury trials
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
both times not guilty after just
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
destroying that man and his family and
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
then the state still wanted to bring a
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
third charge against him and fortunately
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
at the last minute for goodness knows
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
what reason the they came to their
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
censes maybe because the trial judge
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
said you're going to bring more of this
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
crap in my courtroom and they null pred
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
it so I don't see this giving what you
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
might or what some might argue is a get
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
out of jail free card for bad behavior I
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
I just respectfully don't see that
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
happening this is simply the showing of
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
a firearm because once you add in more
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
facts like me like the person saying
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
well you know what I'm going to do next
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
or something like that they're not
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
merely displaying they're saying
 
01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.990 align:start position:0%
merely displaying they're saying
threatening

01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
threatening
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
words and that's a whole different thing
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
I think that then we're clearly in
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening land and the person
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
can be successfully
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
prosecuted representative
 
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.070 align:start position:0%
prosecuted representative
Newman

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chairman just to clarify
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
what you just said in the hypothetical
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
example of a woman that had a gun in her
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
purse and was in an argument with
 
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
someone and opened their gun and took it
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
out and remained silent would you
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
consider that Reckless
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior in the context if the other
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
party is threatening them like let's say
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're coming towards them or doing
 
01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:49.639 align:start position:0%
something that's threatening I would not
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
consider that I would consider that
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
displaying a firearm because they're
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
letting the other party know that they
 
01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
have a firearm and unfortunately bullies
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
tend to attack the weak and groups of
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
people tend to attack the weak and when
 
01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:05.910 align:start position:0%
people tend to attack the weak and when
they

01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
see that there is a firearm or other
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
equalizing self-defense tool available
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
they may choose not to attack them and
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
so I think that potentially especially
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
um women who now like me I'm
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm a little bit disabled
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
in the sense I have a bad hip and a bad
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
ankle now I'm not the distance Runner I
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
used to be so I can't run from a threat
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
I can I can't even walk fast from a
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
threat the bottom line is that we might
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
help me and others like me to avoid an
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
attack and avoid a larger and greater
 
01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
criminal act simply by showing
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
displaying the firearm which essentially
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully will worn away attack from
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
those who might have chosen to attack
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
what they think is a defenseless person
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
so I think this is going to save a lot
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
of criminal acts and quite frankly
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
potentially save people a lot of
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
injuries and I go back to the Gary kleck
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
out of Florida criminologist his
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
research and John lots and many others
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
that show the mere presence of a firearm
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
sometime deters much criminal
 
01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:18.930 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
sir seeing no further hands raised I
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank witness for comment or
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and I would
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you okay that took a
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
couple tries um hello again I'm Tracy H
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
brette here on behalf of myself and the
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
Kent Street Coalition working group on
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
gun violence prevention um I just want
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
to say simply that uh regarding
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
definitions and statutes section two of
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
6313 states that um Reckless conduct is
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
a classy felony if a deadly weapon um as
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
625 11 section five is used and um I
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
want to focus more on the statutory
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
definition as opposed to a dictionary
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
definition so that section says um
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon means that any firearm
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
knife or other substance or thing which
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the manner it is used intended to be
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
used or threatened to be used is known
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
to be capable of producing death or
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury um Firearms
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
obviously fit that description and so
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
the law there makes a point of stating
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
that Rec Reckless use of a deadly weapon
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
is a felony and so my question there
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
would be why would you exempt firearms
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
from that um then you get into the
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
definition of display and so I think
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
that that's a really broad term and you
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
get into a subjective definition of that
 
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
and you end up I think at a at a poorly
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
drafted bill um it's a broad
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
term inter that can be interpreted a
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
number of different ways depending on
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
who's holding the firearm what they're
 
01:33:23.109 --> 01:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
doing doing with it who's seeing it
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
where they are what the context is ETC
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and a lot has been said about this so
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go into too much detail
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
um but is taking a gun out of its
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
holster to show it to a friend a display
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
that should be Reckless conduct um I
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
don't know where is that person are they
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
experienced is the gun loaded are you in
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
a crowded place and I think a lot of the
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
different people in this room are going
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
to answer those questions differently
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
Define reckless differently um and the
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
example that kept coming back to me
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
because it came up in this context um in
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
preparation for the election this fall
 
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
um what about someone who's wearing a
 
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
firearm Miss h b we have to limit
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
testimony minutes per witness so you see
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
time you don't mind just concluding your
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
testimony yes um so what about someone
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
um removing a firearm from a holster at
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
a voting booth uh something a lot of
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
people have to think about this past
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
fall so um thank you for the time and I
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
 
01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:45.310 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
witnesses

01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
excuse I get WR
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
me can oh good uh so I'm here to uh
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
provide testimony against HD 195
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
allowing displaying a
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
firearm or a weapon now uh as you've
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
heard in another testimony displaying
 
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
can be interpreted in a lot of different
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
ways display of a firearm if you just
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
have it in a
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
holster uh presumably is not uh
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
displaying it but if you remove it or if
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
the context of the situation is that you
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
are um uh displaying it in the means of
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
threatening somebody else that is a
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
slippery slope and I would rather not uh
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
include legislation that would allow
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
this slippery slope to be a way to
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
excuse a dangerous or
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
threatening uh type of action now I'm
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
here as I said in my previous testimony
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the other Bill representing the New
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%

01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
organizations Medical societies that are
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
interested in promoting safety rather
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
violence this legislation can
 
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to dangerous
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%

195 my reasons are as follows um number
 
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
one we're talking about firearms and we
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
we refuse to acknowledge that a firearm
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
is a deadly weapon and it has deadly
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
consequences the point of the firearm is
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
to kill or seriously wound another
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
person please let's remember that when

we talk about
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
Firearms displaying a firearm is not a
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
neutral Act of it makes an aggressive
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
and threatening situation which
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
statement it makes an aggressive
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
aggressive and threatening statement
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
which could escalate a situation and
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
result in violence uh the person
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill said this is America
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
and I would add this is New Hampshire
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
and not the wild west govern Governor
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
sus Nunu himself said that New Hampshire
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
is one of the safest states in in the
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
United Nation in the nation um and let
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
me remind you Governor sununu cancelled
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
his 2021 outdoor inauguration ceremony
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
as a precaution against protesters
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%

of
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh committee chairperson which is about
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
the process uh would you allow me just a
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
short two minutes minute to do that
 
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
please I was very and have been very
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
impressed with the process of how you
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
are taking testimony from people but I
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is the second time an attorney has
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
been allowed to speak and answer
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
questions an attorney who is definitely
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
a pro Pro Second Amendment person and I
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
would respectfully ask you in defense of
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
the democratic process that if you are
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to allow a pro Second Amendment
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
attorney as much airtime as you have
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
allowed this person I think it would
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
behoove you to have a a an attorney
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
present who is a proponent of sensible
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
gun legislation thank you very
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr Romero and thank you
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
for testimony and I I believe the the
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
the witness who the attorney testified
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
her testimony was still limited to two
 
01:40:34.510 --> 01:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
minutes A lot of the time taken up was
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
the witness answering questions uh I did
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
set some grounds for today for time each
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
member is is permitted to ask
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
each um witness up to two questions uh
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the third of the discretion of the
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
chair so a lot of the comments and
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
testimony provide thereafter was the
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
witness answering questions asked by the
 
01:40:56.159 --> 01:40:57.070 align:start position:0%
witness answering questions asked by the
committee

01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
members so if there is any other members
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the public with a legal background
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're also welcome to speak and I
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
would encourage uh people with a legal
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
background to uh come before this
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee your testimony is always
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%

insightful is there any questions of of
 
01:41:16.679 --> 01:41:19.830 align:start position:0%

Bill 195 seeks to add a new qualifier to
 
01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.510 align:start position:0%
Bill 195 seeks to add a new qualifier to
chapter

01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
6313 as a refresher that chapter begins
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
like this a person is guilty of Reckless
 
01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
conduct if he recklessly engages in
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
conduct which places or may Place
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
Another in danger of serious bodily
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
injury and then follows with this
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct is a class B felony if
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
the person uses a deadly weapon as
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
62511 if you dig into 62511 you'll find
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
that a deadly weapon defines as any
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
firearm knife or other substance or
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
thing which in the manner it is used and
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is the important part intended to
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
be used or threatened to be used is
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
known to be capable of producing death
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
or serious bodily injury so I pose this
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
to you if a person goes walking through
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
the aisles of Market Basket carrying a
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
baseball bat around not hitting anything
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily coming near anyone not
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
saying anything maybe just striding
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
through carrying it on their shoulder do
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
you think that behavior will cause alarm
 
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
of course it will because a baseball bat
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
is something unusual to carry around the
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
supermarket it is not normal it is an
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
alarming behavior and it should be let's
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
say you go to a restaurant and the
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
person at the table next to you pulls
 
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
out their 10 and 3/4 inch whing survival
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
knife with the serrated edge and the gut
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
hook they put it on the table for
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
everyone to see why on Earth would they
 
01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
do that ostensibly the restaurant
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
provides its own Cutlery that's an
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
unusual item to bring to a restaurant
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
it's an alarming situation and it should
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
be those instances are examples of
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
coercive control their actions taken to
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
send a message to the people around them
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
that the balance of power is in the
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
favor of the weapon holder
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
because represent representative I do
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
have to limit uh testim to two minutes
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
per witness so if I just would ask that
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
sentence thank you Mr chair those
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
examples are examples of coercive
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
control and those create an unequal
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
power Dynamic it's a form of violence
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
and as House Bill 195 seeks to codify
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
coercive control as an act of
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
intimidation to
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
silence as a silent threat it breaks
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
down boundaries it threatens
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
safety and I ask you to vote in
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on House Bill 195
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
and not normalize the presence of
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
firearms in all parts of our lives a
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to two minutes per
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
person so I ask in to the public that
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
you we now include your
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
Bradley thank you chair and thank you
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a lot about the presence
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
of a firearm as being a deescalation
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
method um supposedly because its mere
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
presence should threaten the other party
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
into compliance of what the gun holder
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
wants do you think someone simply
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
compliance am I still
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
unmuted you're muted okay thank you um I
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so coercive
 
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
control creates an unequal power dynamic
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
in a relationship it is a form of
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
violence it's a key factor in domestic
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
abuse and intimate partner violence um
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's part of the pattern of behavior
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
that perpetrators use to gain power and
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
control and coercive control is an act
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
of intimidation it's a silent threat so
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
when someone has a firearm they don't
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
need to brandish it its presence is a
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
threat alone ask any victim of domestic
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
violence whose abuser never pointed a
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
weapon at it but would take it out and
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
leave it on the kitchen table as a
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
warning or um ask the victim whose date
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
ended in sexual assault why they froze
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
when a weapon came out of the glove
 
01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
compartment you know just for show or
 
01:46:09.589 --> 01:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
ask a family member who lost a gun one a
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
loved one to gun violence and how normal
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
it feels to be around people who to
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
their knowledge have no permit no
 
01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
training and for all anyone knows no
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
background check in acquiring that gun
 
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
because Private Sales don't require them
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire nothing about any of those
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
instances are improved with the presence
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
firearm representative
 
01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
Knight thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
you just spoke to um domestic um abuse
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
in our state and I was wondering uh
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
since I'm not sure how familiar you are
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
with that subject if you could clarify
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
to us what this bill would do to
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
domestic uh survivors in this state if
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
pass um thank you for the question I
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
will I I will share with you through my
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
work with survivors of Domestic and
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence that um the
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
normalization of the presence of
 
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
firearms in all parts of our Lives is
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and it creates a
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
threatening environment everywhere um it
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
is not a deescalation technique because
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
we know that the coercive control of
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
just the presence of a firearm is meant
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
to send a message to the people around
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
you that the balance of power is off and
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's in favor of the person who has the
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
gun on their hip in the back of their
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
pants on their leg in their jacket
 
01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
because they've in introduced an item
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's unusual to to their surroundings
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
to all of our surroundings and they've
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
created a circumstance where they've
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrated they're comfortable with
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
that threat being out in the community
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable being the person who
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
is the threat that is coercive control
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
and that is the kind of threat that
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
people who have suffered domestic
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
violence and intimate partner violence
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
and sexual assault live with when they
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
have experienced um that kind of
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
Violence by perpetrators and then see it
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
in their community in places where you
 
01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:32.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to see
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
it representative green thank you Mr
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe that many people and
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
especially some women carry guns that
 
01:48:43.599 --> 01:48:47.870 align:start position:0%
especially some women carry guns that
are

01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
unloaded would I believe that women
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
women car that some women carry unloaded
 
01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.589 align:start position:0%
women car that some women carry unloaded
guns

01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
guns
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes I believe that the presence of a
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
firearm loaded or unloaded increases
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
potential for violence as demonstrated
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
you the chair would like to ask a
 
01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you can you explain
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
your understanding of the difference
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
between displaying and
 
01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:28.470 align:start position:0%
between displaying and
brandishing

01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes so um displaying um in fact I have
 
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:36.830 align:start position:0%
yes so um displaying um in fact I have
called

01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
firearm is the way um is the um the use
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
firearm as a threat so to you know wave
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
it around um it's my understanding that
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
is to take it out throw put it on the
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
table um to wave it in the air to
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
display it openly and be threatening
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
about it to use it in anger or
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
excitement um that's brandishing display
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
is showing it so um you know if if you
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
and I are sitting at a table and you
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
take your jacket off and you show me you
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
have a firearm that's a display and I
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
know automatically that you know the
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
person in the p in power at that table
 
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
is you because you've got the deadliest
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
table representative
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
new my question so if I can more or less
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
paraphrase what what you just said
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
brandishing uh is the use of a firearm
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh when you're making a direct threat um
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
and displaying would be used using it uh
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
as an indirect threat but in either case
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
it would appear to be that you're using
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
it make a threat um would you agree with
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
that um so I think um I I appreciate the
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
question but I really want to um I want
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
to dial back to what we actually have in
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
statute and in chapter 625 semicolon 11
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
part five when we're using the
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
definition of deadly weapon it means a
 
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
firearm knife or other substance or
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
thing which in the manner it is used
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
intended to be used or threatened to be
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
used is known to be capable of producing
 
01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
death or serious bodily injury so in our
 
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
statute we have already codified that we
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
know that a firearm can is capable of
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
producing death or serious bodily injury
 
01:52:04.589 --> 01:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
and what HB 195 wants to do is take that
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
out and and you and add it as a
 
01:52:09.199 --> 01:52:11.189 align:start position:0%
out and and you and add it as a
qualifier

01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
qualifier
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make the guns any less
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
deadly it just makes the person using it
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
that much more
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
you representative uh the chair would
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
have a question and I just want to thank
 
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
you in advance for taking my question
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
question and this correct me if I'm
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
understanding your testimony correctly
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
is there are you saying that there's not
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
any way to disting to display a firearm
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
without actually threatening someone at
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
time um my testimony is the presence of
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
a fire
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
Firearms as a deadly weapon which we
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
have codified in our
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
statute we know to be it to be capable
 
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
of producing death or bodily injury and
 
01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
when a firearm is present it creates a
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
situation of coercive control and as has
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
been um demonstrated in previous
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and in questions from um
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
committee the uh intent is to actually
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
create coercive control um whether that
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
coercive control um is intended to be
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
de-escalating or escalating there's
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
actually no way to know what the person
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
who is ex who is creating the coercive
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
control you don't know what their intent
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
is but we do know because we have
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
defined deadly weapon in statute as
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
something known to be capable of
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
producing death or serious bodily
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
injury so when you introduce that
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
coercive control into it into the
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
situation there's no way for anybody
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
else to know the
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
intent you have for displaying or
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
brandishing because you have the most
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
situation

01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%

01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
be lobbying or
 
01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:37.639 align:start position:0%
for a we have a law which allows open
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
carry so you're you really seem to to
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
avoid all this coercive as we would be
 
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.189 align:start position:0%
avoid all this coercive as we would be
better

01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
off dis always displaying our gun in the
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
open no carrying it under the under your

um raising a point yes can I please
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
point of order is
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
recognized I think it's inappropriate
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
for either side whether we like what
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
we're hearing or not to insinuate
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
another member is a lobbyist when
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're respectful member of our house
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%

01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%

term when it was used by the
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative tesman wasn't intended to
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
imply lobbyist I think he mented as a
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
form of AD advocacy if you swap the word
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy or advocating with word
 
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
lobbying um I can understand your
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
confusion though but I didn't perceive

um

02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
generally and I've only listened to part
 
02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:39.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
testimony it seems that there's a
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
concern that the display of a firearm
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
somehow conveys threat
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
that the point I wish to address is this
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh a prior witness referred to some CDC
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
statistics the CDC is a huge
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
organization and
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
produces many many hundreds of series of
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
Statistics but the
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
gravamin of the witnesses testimony is
 
02:04:21.069 --> 02:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
that new h sure somehow is becoming a
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
less safe
 
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
place I will site to a very specific
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
source and it's a well-known Source it's
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
a series published by the FBI called
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
crime in the United States they've
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
published it in its present form since
 
02:04:37.679 --> 02:04:40.149 align:start position:0%
published it in its present form since
about

02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
1961 data published in table four Under
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
The Heading of incidents of violent
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
crime show that in
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
2019 New Hampshire went from the third
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
safest state in the Union to the second
 
02:05:01.709 --> 02:05:01.719 align:start position:0%
safest state in the Union again this is
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
incidents of violent crime per 100,000
 
02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
residents that metric means that the
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
incident is adjusted for population
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
differences between the various States
 
02:05:16.589 --> 02:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
from at least
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
2001 through 2018
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me we do have to limit testimony
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
to 2 minutes per witness if you don't
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
mind just concluding your testimony with
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
sentence hello oh
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
yes um we have to limit testimony 2
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
minutes per
 
02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
so if you don't mind your time is
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
expired you just you don't mind just
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%

additional

02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
sment um I'm sorry I could not hear that
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
which you just said
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
sir we have to limit testimony to
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public to two minutes per
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
witness your time is expired so the
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%

just conclude your
 
02:06:20.669 --> 02:06:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
if I have one sentence it is this New
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is now the second safest state
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
in the Union with relatively few firearm
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
laws and any suggestion to the contrary
 
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
defies the data as published by the FBI
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%

Hampshire and uh we are in a strong
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
support of uh voting this bill ought to
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
pass uh we've heard that uh about the W
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
bird case in n in
 
02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
20110 uh in response to that case the
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening statute was amended
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
to add paragraph four which states and
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard a person who responds to a
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
threat which would be considered by a
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasonable person as likely
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
to cause serious bodily injury or death
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the person or to another by
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
displaying a fire or other means of
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
self-defense with the intent to warn
 
02:07:53.549 --> 02:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
away the person making the threat shall
 
02:07:55.229 --> 02:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
not have committed a criminal act under
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
this section The Reckless conduct
 
02:07:59.709 --> 02:07:59.719 align:start position:0%
conduct statute was also subsequently
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
amended so that it was no longer subject
 
02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
to the sentencing provisions of RSA
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
6512 section
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
2G uh subsequently Ward bird sentence
 
02:08:11.549 --> 02:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
was commuted in 2011 and go New
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire go Hampshire is of the mind
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
that the proposed amendment to The
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct statute comports with
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
the sentiment behind the amendment to
 
02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
the criminal threatening statute if a
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
person threatens another with a firearm
 
02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
they will be charged under the criminal
 
02:08:25.229 --> 02:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
threatening statute but if they display
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
a firearm with no threat it ought not to
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
be a
 
02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
crime um this bill will make people
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
safer it's better to warn than to act uh
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
this gives people the option displaying
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
Firearms are used much more often to
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
prevent a violent attack than they are
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
used to shoot and self-defense and
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
lastly I'd like to just say you know
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard about Drive uh different
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
what is reckless and what is brandishing
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
and other things we know that driving is
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
legal reckless driving is not driving on
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
the shoulder is reckless but swerving
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
onto the shoulder to avoid an accident
 
02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
is not Reckless and would be considered
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
prudent by most we should at least be
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with our laws and make sure
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
that our criminal threatening statutes
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
are in line with our Reckless conduct
 
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and don't differ in in any way
 
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
from any of the other parts of our law
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
so I I urge you to pass this and I'd be
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
02:09:12.159 --> 02:09:17.310 align:start position:0%

yes we can hear you thank you again for
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Alan Rice a
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
resident of Bedford New Hampshire and I
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
represent Gun Owners of America a
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
National Organization I have submitted
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee and I
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
just want to comment on some of the
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
things that those who oppose this bill
 
02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
have stated um I think they have it
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
exactly opposite um a victim of domestic
 
02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.510 align:start position:0%
exactly opposite um a victim of domestic
violence

02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:52.599 align:start position:0%
a victim of Street violence a
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
shopkeeper um yes the presence of a
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
firearm does reverse the balance of
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
power and enables a victim to survive
 
02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is about defensive display
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
defensive display is not the same as
 
02:14:10.990 --> 02:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
brandishing brandish is to wave or
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
flourish something especially a weapon
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
as a threat in anger or
 
02:14:19.589 --> 02:14:19.599 align:start position:0%
excitement display is to show a
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
prominent exhibition of something
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
whether the firearm is displayed in a
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
holster or someone's holding it in a low
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
ready position prepared to defend
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
themselves either way that turns the
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
tables on the attacker and the victim
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
probably won't be a
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
victim defensive display should be
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
specifically lawful in New Hampshire and
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
this bill would do that and I would urge
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote house bill
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
195 ought to pass without Amendment or
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
change and I'm happy to entertain
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%

02:15:31.629 --> 02:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
Rep good morning members of the
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%

02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
my on behalf of myself personally as
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
well as the New Hampshire Firearms
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
Coalition in support of the bill before
 
02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
you this bill will in fact allow gun
 
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
owners not to be recklessly charged
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
um with criminal activity when there has
 
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
been no crime I think there's a lot of
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
paranoia and fear Mong green going on
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
and I want people to understand that the
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
mere display of a firearm is not a
 
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:03.030 align:start position:0%
mere display of a firearm is not a
criminal

02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
activity the um escalation of a of a
 
02:16:10.669 --> 02:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
heated argument um maybe uh actions on
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
behalf physical actions on behalf of one
 
02:16:14.549 --> 02:16:14.559 align:start position:0%
of the parties in it in an altercation
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
is different and that's already covered
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
under criminal threatening statute
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is something where someone's jacket
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
um is picked up when they bend over at
 
02:16:26.589 --> 02:16:26.599 align:start position:0%
the store or something and there you
 
02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
could have someone charged needlessly um
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
with a crime where there has been no
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
crime so I would ask that you would
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill um as filed with no
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.509 --> 02:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
much representative Bert thank you Mr
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you you a former
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
testimony so we've heard testimony and I
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify it one more time
 
02:16:59.790 --> 02:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
because I think you alluded to it if a
 
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
woman or a
 
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
man regardless of gender wants to abuse
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
their significant other and they pull a
 
02:17:12.509 --> 02:17:12.519 align:start position:0%
gun out just set it on the kitchen table
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's laws against that
 
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
correct I if someone is threatened
 
02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
another there is an entire section of
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
statutes that covers criminal
 
02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
threatening it is it is irregardless of
 
02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
whether there's a firearm involved or
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
not it could be another another tool
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
like a knife or um it could it could
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
just be based on sheer size um women in
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
particular don't have the same physical
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
stature that men do so they're at a tech
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
a technical and a tactical disadvantage
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
if there is somebody who is much larger
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
in statute who's making verbal
 
02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
threatening or um comments and this
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
levels the playing field so I think I I
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
hope I've answered your question but it
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the firearm
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening is an act by itself
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether there's a firearm
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%

02:19:16.439 --> 02:19:31.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:19:31.870 --> 02:19:31.880 align:start position:0%

representative Norm
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
silver yes Mr chairman uh thank you very
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
much uh Mr chairman members of the
 
02:19:41.709 --> 02:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Norman silver state
 
02:19:43.509 --> 02:19:43.519 align:start position:0%
representative from belnap 2 which are
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
the towns of Guilford and
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
Meredith uh Bill
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
307 deals with a rewrite of RSA 159
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
colon 26 which we thought was our
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
preemption or Firearms preemption
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
statute this was passed several years
 
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
ago in an effort to make uniform across
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
the state that the state alone was the
 
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
source of any Firearms
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
regulation what has happened since its
 
02:20:14.349 --> 02:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
passage it's only 11 lines long and it
 
02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
has really very little enforcement
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism what's happened since the
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
passage of 159 col 26 is that various
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
insundry uh government entities uh and
 
02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
even individuals operating uh Government
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
properties under leases and things of
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
that sort uh have undertaken to adopt
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
rules regulations ordinances uh that
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
seek to regulate Firearms
 
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:43.429 align:start position:0%
seek to regulate Firearms
notwithstanding

02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
15926 so the point of the the hb3 307 is
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
the recitation that a recognition that
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not a home rule state
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
we don't let the individual
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and lower government
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
agencies and uh entities just decide
 
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
what they want to do on their own we
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
haven't granted them that power the
 
02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
power comes from the general court the
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
general court has previously said it
 
02:21:11.469 --> 02:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
wants to preempt all firearms regulation
 
02:21:14.429 --> 02:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
but because of the weaknesses in
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
15926 uh I have brought forth uh Bill
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
307 which makes it crystal clear in a
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
lot more lines unfortunately than 11
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
lines of the original statute and a lot
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
more lines that all firearms regulation
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
must be done at the state level not the
 
02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
local level and it provides for an
 
02:21:36.990 --> 02:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism and it provides
 
02:21:40.990 --> 02:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
for the ability of anyone who uh is
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
agreed by passage of some of these uh
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
basically unlawful uh enactment by local
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
agencies to get them rescinded and if
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
not uh you know relatively promptly
 
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
rescinded there are some Financial
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
penalties involved so that's the whole
 
02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of this it's really to make it
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that when one when we
 
02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:04.870 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that when one when we
adopted

02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
15926 effective in 2011 we really really
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
really meant it so that's the whole
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
hp37 I'll be happy to take any
 
02:22:22.990 --> 02:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative cman thank you
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you uh
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
can you give us a couple of examples
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
that exist right now of where this is uh
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
been the power has been usurped by a
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
local state or
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
schools well of course there's been a
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
wide publicity of the adoption of
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
gun-free zones by local schools school
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
boards within the state uh I'd be happy
 
02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
to compile a a schedule of all the
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
reported instances of basically
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
violation of 15926 by local entities I
 
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the whole list in front of me
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
now but I think we we've seen a lot on
 
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
online we've seen public publicity of
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
school board members saying well I'm
 
02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
going to introduce a uh a resolution
 
02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to adopt a gun-free
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
zone in XYZ town or
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:17.790 align:start position:0%
zone in XYZ town or
city

02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to provide the committee
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
concluded represent test you recognize
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
for a followup uh what I was thinking of
 
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
was the rules
 
02:23:36.269 --> 02:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
are in particularly at UNH you and I are
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with UNH
 
02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but what about those
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
rules yes I mean if if it's basically
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
what what one what house bill 307 does
 
02:23:53.950 --> 02:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
not affect any privately owned property
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
but if it's government own government
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
owned property if it's public
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
property then the public has the right
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
to its second amendment rights and its
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
rights under the New Hampshire
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution and under constitutional
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
carry which the legislature has passed
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
previously and the the the people who
 
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
are in control of whether it's UNH or
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state or keing or any of these
 
02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:19.830 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state or keing or any of these
public

02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
institutions should not have the right
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
they do not have the right currently but
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
they just ignore the prohibition of
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
15926 now if you get into a private
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
school like Dartmouth they can do
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
whatever they they can prohibit whatever
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
they want to it's private property but
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's not government property it's
 
02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
private property and anybody that wants
 
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
if you go to a store and they want to
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
put up this is a this is a gunfree Zone
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to do that but not a a
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
property thank
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%

come from the state
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
No it should come from the people who
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
pass the laws that they know are against
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%

Muse thank you for taking my question
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Silber as I understand
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
your bill uh it would appear to give any
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state the right to bring
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh a civil action against a community in
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
violation of this provision uh so if I'm
 
02:28:32.910 --> 02:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly um if Hanover
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
was to pass a law that uh violated this
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
statute uh somebody in Salem could bring
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:56.230 align:start position:0%

02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
Newman this is sort of a follow on to uh
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's question if in
 
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
fact these new
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
penalties um that are put into effect
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
for the individuals on boards like
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
School boards and Boards of Alderman and
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
whatnot do you have a concern that that
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
would uh limit the number of people that
 
02:29:22.590 --> 02:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
would want to hold those
 
02:29:25.710 --> 02:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
positions it may have a limit on people
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
who might want to serve on those boards
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
to enact law local ordinances and rules
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
law representative Newman do you have a
 
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
followup question yes yes I do um the
 
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
other question I would have in the case
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
that ref representative Muse brought up
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
where an
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
individual um sued successfully a member
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
of a school board or or whatever
 
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
board where would the funds go if they
 
02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
damages I would assume that they would
 
02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
go into the general fund of the
 
02:30:18.190 --> 02:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
state thank you
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman point of order
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
please representative B you were
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
recognized for a point of order thank
 
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um you know I'm sure it
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't intentional but when a
 
02:30:32.349 --> 02:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
representative on the committee that is
 
02:30:36.429 --> 02:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
at home zoom in uh ask a question should
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
they be visible I know they have to be
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
during voting I just didn't know if they
 
02:30:43.870 --> 02:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
should be so the public can see you know
 
02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative point of order
 
02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the rule is that the
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
video for the representatives dis home
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
must only be turned on when you're are
 
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
voting during the executive session
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
however I would encourage the
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
members participate when they ask a
 
02:31:08.349 --> 02:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
question you turn their video on I just
 
02:31:11.269 --> 02:31:11.279 align:start position:0%

this potential um
 
02:31:49.150 --> 02:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
overreach we want to use that term by
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
allowing the voters of that Community to
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
um respond by removing people who are
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing things from the school board or
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
Town Council that they do not agree with
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%

rather than opening those people up the
um

02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that would be the case if we
 
02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
were a home rule state but we're not a
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
home rule state and this is these
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
actions are violative of State law
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
adopted by the general court in a
 
02:32:21.070 --> 02:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
non-home rule state yes the voters
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
should turn the people out of office
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
that would be the normal normal result
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
in a home rule state but this is not a
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:33.790 align:start position:0%

thank you representative for taking my
 
02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
section8 it
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
said that public funds and will not be
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
used to purchase uh insurance or defend
 
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
any action or damages an attorney field
 
02:32:58.349 --> 02:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
this sort of uh a violation of uh the
 
02:33:03.469 --> 02:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
the rights of uh those boards to
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
members indemnification of members of
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
boards is appropriate when the members
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
are accused of something but not but is
 
02:33:23.469 --> 02:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
often not provided when they are found
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
to have violated state law or a
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty so in in the case where
 
02:33:31.950 --> 02:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
they violate state law or a fiduciary
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
duty indemnification whether it's in the
 
02:33:38.190 --> 02:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
form of insurance or uh any kind of
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
indemnification provision that they have
 
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
in their own local ordinances would not
 
02:33:44.269 --> 02:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
be appropriate they're violating state
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
law this is an intentional act it's not
 
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
a this is not something that's done
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
simply by negligence this is an overt
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
act that they've taken so that if it's
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
an intentional act insurance normally
 
02:33:59.070 --> 02:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't even protect even liability
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't protect against
 
02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:09.950 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't protect against
intentional

02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:18.269 --> 02:34:18.279 align:start position:0%

Firearms uh that would be as a
 
02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
collective not as a individuals would
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%

02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
from each individual board member that
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
voted for the ordinance or would it come
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
from each uh member of the board
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%

02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
law if if there's a member of a board

believe that the same standard uh that
 
02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
you're that you're calling for for local
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
city officials should apply to
 
02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh State officials at the state level uh
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%

02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
requirements I don't know the answer to
 
02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
that question representative uh that's
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know I've never even I never
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
examined that issue in the context of
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
violating federal
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
answer

02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.990 --> 02:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I would like
 
02:36:25.269 --> 02:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
to thank the representative for his
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for your
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
attention at this time the the chair
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair this is a
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh Auburn Chester and Sandown uh I just
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
want wanted to give a specific example
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
that uh that stuck out in our community
 
02:36:54.510 --> 02:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
um shortly after passing the the
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
original Law we had the timberlan school
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
district in violation of the law pass
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
their own anti-un measures and um when I
 
02:37:08.269 --> 02:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
talked to the some community members
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
that knew that District well and knew
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
the superintendent well um the the
 
02:37:15.269 --> 02:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
feedback I got and admittedly this is
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
second at hand but um the the the the
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
common sense uh approach to to thinking
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
about his action was that um uh he was
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh beyond having anything enforced on
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
him and Timberlane already hires
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys and so he had the taxpayers of
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
his district ready to defend uh his
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
illegal act uh contrary to state law so
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
I I am in favor of 307 if not every word
 
02:37:53.070 --> 02:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
of it certainly the concept we we have
 
02:37:56.670 --> 02:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
intentional scoff laws out there um and
 
02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's violating our citizens rights so I
 
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
think we need to do something about it I
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:13.469 --> 02:38:13.479 align:start position:0%
any representative green thank you Mr
 
02:38:16.510 --> 02:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh to representative silver
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
my question is if you had a teacher that
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
was uh trained and licensed to carry a
 
02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
firearm the teacher would be able to
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
carry this in the
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
school if that's for representative
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
Silber I I I think I have the floor but
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
you can excuse me Mr
 
02:38:36.670 --> 02:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
chair representative to direct a
 
02:38:39.309 --> 02:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
question to either one well
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is the witness
 
02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:42.110 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is the witness
testifying

02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
so please representative
 
02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:46.630 align:start position:0%
so please representative
Edwards

02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
02:38:48.269 --> 02:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
did you repeat your question I'm sorry
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative green I was confused who
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
was taking the question was trained and
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
licensed to carry a firearm this would
 
02:38:58.510 --> 02:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
not restrict them from carrying that
 
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
firearm I I don't believe so I think
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with the law that the
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
legislature passed and the governor
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
you seeing No Hands raised I want to
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
testimony TR Tracy
 
02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
me can you hear me now excuse me can you
 
02:39:49.230 --> 02:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
hello okay Tracy hreat I'm here on
 
02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and the Kent Street
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
Coalition working group on gun violence
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
prevention I'm here to testify against
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
hp37 because it seeks not only to expand
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
our state's existing preemption law but
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
it specifically targets schools and it
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
severely punishes individual public
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
servants for even attempting to save
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
lives in their own communities it's not
 
02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
a bill merely to PR OTE proun policies
 
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
but it's intended to wipe out any gun
 
02:40:22.110 --> 02:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
safety attempts and to do that with a
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
Vengeance it would mandate that no
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
public K through2 school or the New
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University system as well as
 
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
other public entities could take any
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
measure to prohibit parents teachers
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
staff visitors or students from carrying
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
or storing guns and it would do this to
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
despite mountains of evidence showing
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
that children's curiosity for example
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
when they find guns accidents that occur
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
at schools with guns substantial
 
02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
increased expenses by universities that
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
must be born by these universities when
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
they're forced to allow guns on campuses
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
um allowing High suicide rates among New
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's young people and
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire education officials
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
and others um they need the ability to
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
determine how to deal with these
 
02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
problems what they most certainly don't
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
need is to have the legislature tie
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
their hands behind their backs and
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
threaten them with $100,000 in punitive
 
02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
damages for starters and then forbid
 
02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
them to pay these punishments out of
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
their insurance policies all for the
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
crime of trying to care for their
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
communities um it seems like this whole
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
morning has been about legislation
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
designed to elevate the gun interest
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
above any other interests and this is
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
just backwards and
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
wrongheaded those who believe in the
 
02:41:34.510 --> 02:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
sanctity of the gun do have their rights
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
but other interests including human
 
02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
interests are just as important I urge
 
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
the committee to please remember that
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
and to vote to itl this punitive
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:46.750 align:start position:0%
and to vote to itl this punitive

02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing no hands rais up the
 
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
Horgan you're recognized by the chair
 
02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um I didn't
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
know my hearing in judiciary would get
 
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
over in time for me to speak to this and
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
yours is running a little long um I'm
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
represent Timothy Horan I represent the
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
towns of Durham and Madbury Durham is
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
very significantly the home of
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and um they
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
may or may not have someone speaking I
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
don't see who's sitting in you can't see
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
who's sitting in the virtual Gallery but
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
I know they're extremely not interested
 
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
in allowing just anybody to have carried
 
02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
guns on campus I know that annoyed I
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
know at least one member of this Comm
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh sort of complained about
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
this U we had the uh session days at UNH
 
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
especially since they do allow some
 
02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
people to carry guns for example uh we
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
had a police presence at our sessions
 
02:42:58.670 --> 02:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
and even some members of the National
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
Guard so they uh they want very much be
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
able to do the same thing Dartmouth or
 
02:43:07.070 --> 02:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
any uh private institution so-called
 
02:43:08.790 --> 02:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
private institution does which is be
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
able to set their own rules for guns um
 
02:43:13.309 --> 02:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
they mostly ban gun in the campus
 
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
residence the classroom buildings and
 
02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
they and all sorts of other things that
 
02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
are legal so the mere fact that guns are
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
not illegal doesn't mean that uh UNH
 
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
like any other any other institution
 
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
might not want them to be restricted on
 
02:43:32.910 --> 02:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
their premises so that's uh that's their
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
theory is is having fewer guns on campus
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
is better better for security not
 
02:43:39.790 --> 02:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
everybody necessarily agrees with that
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
but that's a that's their decision they
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
should be free to make it just like Dart
 
02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:44.269 align:start position:0%
should be free to make it just like Dart
and

02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
actually amount of money the UNH gets
 
02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers percentages uh it's
 
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
about 10% from from State funding then
 
02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's some federal funding that's
 
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
actually not that much different than
 
02:43:57.670 --> 02:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
what the private institutions doing
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
consider all the grants and the other
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
things too also I always finds ironic
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
with all those bills we're always very
 
02:44:07.469 --> 02:44:07.479 align:start position:0%
about gun owners inadvertently breaking
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
the law and so I'm kind of surprised I'm
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
not really into guns I do own a car
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
which is also like a very expensive very
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous object which and I'm really
 
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
kind of baffled that somebody who's you
 
02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
know somebody who's into guns is somehow
 
02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
not aware you can't expect them to
 
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
beware the fact that guns aren't allowed
 
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
everywhere or that laws are different in
 
02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
different places I've never quite
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
understood that I know I just know as as
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
a motorist as somebody who likes to
 
02:44:36.750 --> 02:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
drive I know my car is not allowed just
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
anywhere I can't just drive it just
 
02:44:40.269 --> 02:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere I
 
02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
want representative Morgan we do have to
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to two minutes per
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
Witness if you don't mind concluding
 
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:08.429 --> 02:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
done your
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
testimony uh oh I'm sorry yes I I was I
 
02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
figur I pretty much finished I mean
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's more I could say but apparently
 
02:45:21.950 --> 02:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
I've I've used up two minutes I didn't
 
02:45:23.309 --> 02:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
hear the announcement at the beginning I
 
02:45:25.550 --> 02:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
came in before re while R Silber was
 
02:45:27.630 --> 02:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
speaking so that's I there's a lot of
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
other reasons um think a lot of Reason
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
Wise It's a bad Bill and actually
 
02:45:34.269 --> 02:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
educational institutions um they
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
probably represent representan I I'll
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um well that that's it I think
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
and I I think especially educational
 
02:45:48.429 --> 02:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
institutions uh should be Exempted from
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and the whole bill should be
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
it but even if you do pass it you should
 
02:45:54.030 --> 02:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
leave out the educational institutions
 
02:45:57.950 --> 02:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
in particular so um thanks thanks
 
02:46:01.150 --> 02:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
bye see no represent board
 
02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
name you have a
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative my question um federal
 
02:46:18.030 --> 02:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
law already uh for H hibits firearms on
 
02:46:19.510 --> 02:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:46:26.349 --> 02:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
property um state law 159 col in 26 uh
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
prohibits uh school boards and munities
 
02:46:29.439 --> 02:46:31.190 align:start position:0%
prohibits uh school boards and munities
from

02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:46:34.269 --> 02:46:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh opposing
 
02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
regulation about Firearms uh this bill
 
02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:39.990 align:start position:0%
regulation about Firearms uh this bill
of

02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
307 basically States penalties for
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
violation of 159 9
 
02:46:50.269 --> 02:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
26 um is it not true that school boards
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
could actually ask uh federal law
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce uh Firearms uh on
 
02:46:57.840 --> 02:46:59.150 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce uh Firearms uh on
school

02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
property um basically basically yes but
 
02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
it's um Most states also have a state
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
law that parallels um parallels that um
 
02:47:10.429 --> 02:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily the expert on it but
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
I I have supported bills about guns on
 
02:47:17.429 --> 02:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
campus guns on on school property so it
 
02:47:19.070 --> 02:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
is a violation of federal law but it
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
would be better if we had a state law
 
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
and of course this goes beyond the
 
02:47:27.469 --> 02:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
status quo and actually like uh forbids
 
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
any type of anti- firearms rules on
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
school property and that as I said
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
before that's inconsistent with the fact
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
that schools appropriately ban all sorts
 
02:47:38.950 --> 02:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
of things that are allowable outside
 
02:47:41.230 --> 02:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
premises of the school and there I think
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
there's a good argument made that people
 
02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
should not be carrying firearms um on on
 
02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
on on on the campus of any type of
 
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
educational institution except for
 
02:47:54.150 --> 02:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
except for certain purposes so that's
 
02:47:56.590 --> 02:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's about the best answer I
 
02:47:59.870 --> 02:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
got there you recognize for a followup
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
question chairman so I know there is
 
02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:04.349 align:start position:0%
question chairman so I know there is
another

02:48:04.349 --> 02:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
bill on that's in the legislature right
 
02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
now to uh allow
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh state law enforcement
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
federal law in this case then there will
 
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
be a
 
02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
conflict state law enforcement and
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
federal law and uh would the law
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement agent or law enforcement
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
officer um have to choose which laws to
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforce um I'm it's probably good point
 
02:48:40.990 --> 02:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
I can't really answer that any detail I
 
02:48:44.510 --> 02:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
do I can say that which as I repeat
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
which I I guess I already point I
 
02:48:47.950 --> 02:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
already made but maybe I'll make it a
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
second time as quickly as can that it's
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
states that have guns in school that
 
02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
allow State scho
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
districts most in Most
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
states the wayt this will suspended has
 
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
been a point of order raise
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace you're recognized
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
for a point of order thank you Mr
 
02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
chairman presently we're discussing
 
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 307 not the other bill so I'd
 
02:49:10.990 --> 02:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
like to get back on topic in in front of
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
us uh thank you representa Wallace for
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
your point of order
 
02:49:18.269 --> 02:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
I I agree that we are it's currently the
 
02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that's open right now
 
02:49:22.469 --> 02:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
is for house 307 so we try to keep the
 
02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
testony narrow to that we do have a lot
 
02:49:37.309 --> 02:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
question okay um I mean I I think I
 
02:49:46.630 --> 02:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
already answered repent both repent
 
02:49:48.830 --> 02:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
board's questions as best of my ability
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
they're both very good questions you the
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the second one um second one that's the
 
02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
subject of of other bills as well so
 
02:50:00.830 --> 02:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
would be better um I mean the school
 
02:50:02.349 --> 02:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
there is it would be easier for law
 
02:50:04.349 --> 02:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce you know problems
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
with firearms on any type of campuses um
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
if we had a state law that paralleled
 
02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
the federal law which Most states do so
 
02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:12.870 align:start position:0%
the federal law which Most states do so
and

02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
there's that's a subject that's probably
 
02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
a topic for another day not necessarily
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily the best person to
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
address the issue but that's that's my
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of itrees with this that
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%

and why I co-sponsored it I have a
 
02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
constituent um who works for the State
 
02:51:18.510 --> 02:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh he drives in a vehicle all over but
 
02:51:21.550 --> 02:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
he's also a police officer in our town
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
and has training he has applied several
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
times to get an exception so that he can
 
02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
carry a firearm in the car in his
 
02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:32.150 align:start position:0%
carry a firearm in the car in his
vehicle

02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
and the department um hasn't even
 
02:51:40.269 --> 02:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
followed its own rules now when police
 
02:51:43.670 --> 02:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
officers were um at risk around the
 
02:51:48.469 --> 02:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
country um he was very very concerned so
 
02:51:51.469 --> 02:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
I am hoping that you will uh look at
 
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill carefully and understand that
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just about schools as people
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
are saying it's about public uh
 
02:52:01.870 --> 02:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
government property and
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
public uh people and their
 
02:52:07.309 --> 02:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights I mean this person
 
02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
was very concerned like I said he works
 
02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:11.840 align:start position:0%

02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
daily and he's also a police officer of
 
02:52:17.550 --> 02:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
which is no secret and even with all his
 
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
training he is not allowed to carry a
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%

hi thank you uh um yes I'm testifying in

opposition to this bill um and as I've
 
02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
said before I am Leonard Korn I am a a
 
02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist in
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh I am also representing the
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medical Society and the
 
02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Psychiatric
 
02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
Society and uh uh
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm testifying in opposition to this
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill I realize that there are already
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
preemption uh preventing school boards
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
from um um providing for safety relative
 
02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
to guns and I don't agree with that uh
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
already uh um that we already have that
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
but I want to I want to oppose this bill
 
02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
which is just expanding the
 
02:54:19.910 --> 02:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
preemption it ought to be necessary for
 
02:54:22.429 --> 02:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
communities as well as school boards as
 
02:54:23.469 --> 02:54:23.479 align:start position:0%
well as
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities to vote to make their
 
02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
communities safer regarding guns knives
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
and other things that people may carry
 
02:54:38.309 --> 02:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
with them uh it is interesting to me
 
02:54:40.750 --> 02:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
that again we have another piece of
 
02:54:45.550 --> 02:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that would um
 
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to uh promote violence rather
 
02:54:51.870 --> 02:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
than discourage
 
02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
violence and I I think we need greater
 
02:54:56.870 --> 02:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
safety rather than less safety in our
 
02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
communities so please vote against this
 
02:55:03.389 --> 02:55:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.510 --> 02:55:10.520 align:start position:0%

the way I'm I'm reading the bill
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
basically the only change in the RSA is
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's adding
 
02:55:24.229 --> 02:55:24.239 align:start position:0%

02:56:40.750 --> 02:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
hp37 I have to say this morning I'm
 
02:56:43.510 --> 02:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
starting to feel very frustrated
 
02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:44.670 align:start position:0%
starting to feel very frustrated
everything

02:56:44.670 --> 02:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm hearing is about the right to
 
02:56:49.710 --> 02:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
bear arms as if this were the endall and
 
02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
Beall of how we live in New Hampshire um
 
02:56:56.830 --> 02:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
they're owning a gun is not the only way
 
02:56:59.469 --> 02:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
for citizens to protect themselves
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
sensible gun legislations are um also
 
02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:03.870 align:start position:0%
sensible gun legislations are um also
are

02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
self-defense I'm frustrated that the gun
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
lobby has shown no interest um or
 
02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
willingness to to sit down with those
 
02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
who oppose expanding these laws and to
 
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
really uh find common ground to look at
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that gun violence is a Public
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
Health crisis in this country um it's
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
very frustrating to me that that all the
 
02:57:36.309 --> 02:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
testimony I hear this morning is about
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
my rights and the danger that I might be
 
02:57:44.309 --> 02:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
in uh to to exercise my rights I'm just
 
02:57:46.429 --> 02:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
going to finish by saying that as a
 
02:57:49.269 --> 02:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
mother a grandmother and a retired
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
School social worker I say categorically
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
the Firearms have absolutely no place in
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
the school Educators and parents and
 
02:58:03.950 --> 02:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
school administrators have a duty of
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
care to Children and Youth and they
 
02:58:11.269 --> 02:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
cannot do that if people other than a
 
02:58:14.349 --> 02:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
uniform police officer are coming onto
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
the grounds with Firearms there have
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
been too many school shootings already
 
02:58:23.229 --> 02:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
and and having someone with the firearm
 
02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
as in Parkland will'll show you it's not
 
02:58:29.950 --> 02:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
going to deter a shooting thank you for

oppose
 
02:59:24.670 --> 02:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
hp37 a danger Dangerous and punitive
 
02:59:26.389 --> 02:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill that greatly weakens protections
 
02:59:28.030 --> 02:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
against gun violence and weakens our
 
02:59:30.349 --> 02:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
community's ability to enact and enforce
 
02:59:32.229 --> 02:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have proven effective in
 
02:59:35.309 --> 02:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
protecting its citizens as it exists as
 
02:59:38.229 --> 02:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
it is exists today New Hampshire already
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
bars um by law from establishing and
 
02:59:42.349 --> 02:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
enforcing ordinances and regulations
 
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
around firearms that they find
 
02:59:46.469 --> 02:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable sorry I have a sore throat in
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
the protection of their citizens these
 
02:59:49.950 --> 02:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances and regulations can be
 
02:59:51.389 --> 02:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
tailored specifically to meet the needs
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
of local communities and many states to
 
02:59:55.510 --> 02:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
provide life-saving tools to prevent gun
 
02:59:57.469 --> 02:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
violence unfortunately our state's
 
02:59:59.870 --> 02:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
preemption law already prevents this us
 
03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
from doing so and now instead of rolling
 
03:00:04.990 --> 03:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
back that preemption law and empowering
 
03:00:06.910 --> 03:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
localities to take steps to protect our
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
communities the general court is pushing
 
03:00:12.110 --> 03:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
HB 307 a bill that would needlessly and
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
dangerously expand the preemption law
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
law this law um would allow outof State
 
03:00:21.469 --> 03:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh gun lobby groups to bring lawsuits
 
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
against New Hampshire cities and towns
 
03:00:25.389 --> 03:00:25.399 align:start position:0%
if they win forcing courts to award
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
damages of at least $100,000 plus
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees the bill would also
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit localities from using insurance
 
03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
policies to cover these I think um Tracy
 
03:00:37.070 --> 03:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
brette mentioned this it's not
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonable that a town might want to
 
03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
do everything they can to keep someone
 
03:00:42.309 --> 03:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
with a loaded gun off of school grounds
 
03:00:44.349 --> 03:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
high school grounds element school it's
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable that Durham would like
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
to take steps that they keep that they
 
03:00:50.309 --> 03:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
can keep Firearms out of the hands of 18
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
and 19 year olds dealing with pressures
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
and influences that are part of a daily
 
03:00:56.429 --> 03:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
college life I can't think of a worse
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
thing than including guns into uh into
 
03:01:01.229 --> 03:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
colleges it's not unreasonable that
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement be provided the
 
03:01:04.710 --> 03:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
added tools that they need to keep their
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
citizens safe and to those of you who
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
are supportive of philosophy that it's
 
03:01:10.710 --> 03:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
important to give local communities more
 
03:01:12.670 --> 03:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
ability to govern themselves this bill
 
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
stands firmly in opposition to that
 
03:01:17.870 --> 03:01:17.880 align:start position:0%

Cindy White I live in Hopkinton I'm an
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
attorney and a former senior Assistant
 
03:02:46.229 --> 03:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General in New Hampshire and I
 
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
am adamantly opposed to HB 307 this bill
 
03:02:52.349 --> 03:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
is a transparent attempt to intimidate
 
03:02:54.670 --> 03:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
and punish local public school officials
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
who take seriously their obligation to
 
03:02:58.229 --> 03:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
protect students and teachers from gun
 
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
violence this bill is
 
03:03:03.269 --> 03:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it allows any citizen
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the state who believes himself to be
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
AG grieved or any entity or organization
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
whose membership is AG grieved which as
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh the last witness mentioned could even
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
be an outof State org organization to
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit in Superior Court of the
 
03:03:19.150 --> 03:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
county of the plaintiff's residence it
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
further provides that that citizen
 
03:03:21.870 --> 03:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
entity or
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
organization if they Prevail in the case
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
would be entitled to receive damages
 
03:03:27.950 --> 03:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees and costs the obvious
 
03:03:29.710 --> 03:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
problem with this is that believing
 
03:03:31.710 --> 03:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
oneself to be AG grieved which is what
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
the statute says does not give a person
 
03:03:36.510 --> 03:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
or entity legal standing to sue in court
 
03:03:38.590 --> 03:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
the dictionary defines AG grieved as
 
03:03:40.150 --> 03:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
having a feeling that one has been
 
03:03:42.190 --> 03:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
wronged that is very different than
 
03:03:44.590 --> 03:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
having a definite and conrete personal
 
03:03:47.309 --> 03:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
injury which is what is required by part
 
03:03:50.309 --> 03:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
two article 74 of the state constitution
 
03:03:53.150 --> 03:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
for standing to bring a lawsuit the New
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has made it
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
clear that the legislature does not have
 
03:04:00.030 --> 03:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to Grant standing to those
 
03:04:03.550 --> 03:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
who do not meet that constitutional
 
03:04:06.150 --> 03:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
standard it's easy to see the ridiculous
 
03:04:07.630 --> 03:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
consequences that could flow from
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill a person who lives
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
in lonia could sue the Salem School
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
District in the Laconia Superior your
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
court if the Salem School District
 
03:04:17.469 --> 03:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
adopted a policy prohibiting guns in its
 
03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
schools that person could bring a suit
 
03:04:21.389 --> 03:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
and if he prevailed would be entitled to
 
03:04:24.550 --> 03:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
a $100,000 in Damages without ever even
 
03:04:26.269 --> 03:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
having been to Salem OR having been
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
denied entrance into a Salem School
 
03:04:30.429 --> 03:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
while carrying a gun not only is it
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional this bill is bad policy
 
03:04:35.790 --> 03:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
it's unduly harsh it requires courts to
 
03:04:39.150 --> 03:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
order fines of $500 for an inadvertent
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
violation the sponsor said that it was
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
only intentional violations but it's not
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
if you read the language it's $500 for
 
03:04:48.269 --> 03:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
an inadvertent violation and it also
 
03:04:51.790 --> 03:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
requires require uh we do have to limit
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to 2 minutes per witness
 
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
and your time has expired so what I
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
would ask is if you could please
 
03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.279 --> 03:05:18.670 align:start position:0%
 
sentence

03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:22.349 --> 03:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
Miss White you uh you've exce your the
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
the time has expired it's two minutes
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
but you need to unmute yourself the
 
03:05:29.349 --> 03:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
chair will allow you to conclude your
 
03:05:32.670 --> 03:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
test oh I'm sorry okay I I um I thought
 
03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
I was unmuted before um okay so uh it
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
would be $100,000 of damage even in the
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
evidence of no no harm no evidence of
 
03:05:45.790 --> 03:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
harm though the and holding attorneys uh
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry holding local officials liable
 
03:05:50.590 --> 03:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
for their uh personally financially
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
liable for decisions they made in their
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
official capacity would have a terrible
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on people running for
 
03:05:57.229 --> 03:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
office for these reasons I would ask the
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%

03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
307 tell you the the truth
 
03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative I was having my lunch and
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know what
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
happened I didn't hear the go Clos no Mr
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
chairman we're in recess on
 
03:35:56.110 --> 03:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
37 and we still have seven or eight
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
people with their hand raised to speak
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you I have another
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
question before we go into
 
03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
307 I believe that
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
334 should be in fishing game instead of
 
03:36:21.070 --> 03:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
before us because we do not
 
03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
ohvs well you know this is an unusual OB
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
session I don't know what to tell tell
 
03:36:32.910 --> 03:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
me about
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%

right yes Mr chairman thank you um I
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
would like to call Mr chairman if you
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
don't mind uh Penny Dean to speak for
 
03:36:48.269 --> 03:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
307 any yes um ch um chair and members
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for having me
 
03:36:57.150 --> 03:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
and I want to say first of all that I
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
think this bill should be retained I
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
strongly support the bill however it
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be retained and I've thought
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
about these terms and I do not say them
 
03:37:10.189 --> 03:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
lightly this is probably the worst piece
 
03:37:13.070 --> 03:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
of drafting I've ever seen in the 20
 
03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
plus years I've been to the state house
 
03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
it is not Crystal Clear it's not even
 
03:37:20.189 --> 03:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
cloudy it's not visible from 10
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
Ines and I think this bill is actually
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous and Reckless and again I
 
03:37:28.990 --> 03:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
support the concept I support RSA 5926
 
03:37:31.830 --> 03:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
as strongly as I can but what this bill
 
03:37:35.309 --> 03:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
does is repeal and reenact the current
 
03:37:35.319 --> 03:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
does is repeal and reenact the current
RSA

03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
15926 and it does not have a savings
 
03:37:42.349 --> 03:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
clause and I believe that's huge without
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
a savings Clause I believe a court is
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
going to strike down this bill this bill
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
is so poorly done that you would not
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
even give it to a first year law student
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
to identify issues because it'd be like
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
shooting fish in a barrel and I want to
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
start out with some of the basic
 
03:38:01.710 --> 03:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
problems with or one of the many basic
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill first of all um I
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
Heard the sponsor say that it does not
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
deal with private property well it
 
03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely does it talks about private
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
organizations if you look at the bill
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
and let me count how many times I see
 
03:38:22.269 --> 03:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
private organizations or private entity
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have page two line 11 page two line
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
28 page two line 31 33 and
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
36 page three lines 10 and
 
03:38:40.990 --> 03:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
15 page four line one that's just one of
 
03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
the many many problems the other huge
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
problem I see is I could cite cases
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
after case from the New Hampshire
 
03:38:50.070 --> 03:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court where they say the
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislators presume to say what it means
 
03:38:54.030 --> 03:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
and mean what it says and they're going
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
to give effect to every word and when
 
03:38:59.750 --> 03:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
you talk about the legislative intent
 
03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
you talk about the legislative intent
for

03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:39:03.389 --> 03:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
example they talk about declaring all
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
ordinance and regulations null and void
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
but in other parts of the bill they talk
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
about measures directive rules
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
enactments orders are
 
03:39:16.990 --> 03:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
policies it's not consistent in usage
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill when they talk about
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislative intent which is part of the
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill reenacted they talk about Firearms
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
ammunition components but again no
 
03:39:30.990 --> 03:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
policies they use the term components
 
03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
policies they use the term components
and

03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:34.269 --> 03:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
supplies what is the difference between
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
firemen components and supplies and my
 
03:39:39.910 --> 03:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
point to you is that you need consistent
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
l language in this bill of more
 
03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
important to me when they talk about the
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
penalties and prohibitions in what they
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
have enacted or suggested as
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
15928 they specifically don't talk about
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
any oh I apologize Mr chairman speaking
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
if you can oh I apologize yeah you had
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh two minutes and I think you exceeded
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
it by quite a bit oh I apologize sir I
 
03:40:11.950 --> 03:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
didn't see
 
03:40:15.750 --> 03:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:19.590 --> 03:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
and yes yes sir and I apologize for over
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
speaking um the gist of it is I think
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
this bill should be retained I think
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's desperately needed I think it's an
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
excellent idea but I think this
 
03:40:32.910 --> 03:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
bill could do much much much more harm
 
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
and put us in a worse position than we
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
are now if it enacted because of the
 
03:40:39.630 --> 03:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible inconsistent Drafting
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.550 --> 03:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you very much

Milford New Hampshire as an
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
individual I support strongly the
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
concept of this uh HB
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
307 it does not reopen preex uh
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
preemption preemption
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
exists it does
 
03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
authorize uh New Hampshire Constitution
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
2A it exists it merely a allows a
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
citizen to redress knowingly
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
infringing those uh already existing
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
rights and
 
03:41:57.550 --> 03:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
rsas by uh any area in the lower
 
03:42:00.990 --> 03:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
government who chooses it would create a
 
03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
Minefield for a lawfully armed
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
citizen so what we're asking is realize
 
03:42:12.070 --> 03:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
that a lawfully armed citizen desires
 
03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
safety even more than any other person
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
that is part of the reason we are
 
03:42:22.030 --> 03:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.750 --> 03:42:24.760 align:start position:0%

questions thank you for your
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%

to point out the
 
03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in the testimony of some
 
03:44:34.110 --> 03:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
of the opponents of House Bill
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
307 um they really believe that a rule
 
03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
and a sign will stop a murderer criminal
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
or other dangerous individual from

carrying a gun into a school a town
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
office an arena or any place else and
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
prevent violence it's not going to
 
03:44:53.229 --> 03:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
prevent violence what will prevent
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
violence is armed law-abiding people
 
03:44:59.950 --> 03:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
able to fight back when we see these
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
violent attacks across the country they
 
03:45:05.149 --> 03:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
occur in gun-free zones New Hampshire
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have very many gun-free zones
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
and many of them are illegal
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would get rid of the illegal
 
03:45:16.750 --> 03:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
gunfree zones because it would uh
 
03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
include an enforcement mechanism to RSA
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
15926 which is what's currently lacking
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
the opponents even acknowledged that
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
they can't ban guns in these public
 
03:45:30.990 --> 03:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
spaces but they're getting away with it
 
03:45:32.429 --> 03:45:32.439 align:start position:0%
because the current law has no
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism and I would urge
 
03:45:37.950 --> 03:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote House Bill 307
 
03:45:42.990 --> 03:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr rice for your testimony
 
03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%

oppose House Bill 307 New Hampshire
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
already has a preemption law as been
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
stated it already broadly prohibits
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
local municipalities and school
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
districts from enacting Common Sense
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
Firearms regulations this bill takes
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
that a step further and intimidates
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
local officials from doing anything
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the presence of firearms in
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
hight trffic public spaces or learning
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
environments this ridiculous bill could
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
Target staffer administrators who for
 
03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
example question someone bringing a
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
loaded firearm or a knife into an
 
03:46:42.189 --> 03:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
element school this bill would add new
 
03:46:44.349 --> 03:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
punitive measures to intimidate punish
 
03:46:46.030 --> 03:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
and bankrupt local communities and
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
school districts those Court damages up
 
03:46:48.479 --> 03:46:49.229 align:start position:0%
school districts those Court damages up
to

03:46:49.229 --> 03:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:46:52.110 --> 03:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and make the enforcement uh the
 
03:46:54.189 --> 03:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
enactment enforcement of local gun laws
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
grounds for termination of public

employees or removal from public office
 
03:46:59.950 --> 03:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
by the governor I have to point out the
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
incredible double standard here this
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to have the governor
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
unilaterally remove an elected official
 
03:47:08.349 --> 03:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
from office for trying to protect their
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
Community from gun violence but at the
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
same time the New Hampshire house and
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
Governor Chris n refused to do anything
 
03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
about state legislators and party
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
leaders who share racist anti-semitic
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
and sexist messages that encourage
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
violence we urge the committee to vote
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
this bill down and instead spend your
 
03:47:26.830 --> 03:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
time on the real issues facing our state
 
03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:30.950 align:start position:0%

minutes thank you Mr chairman Cordell
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
Johnston representing the New Hampshire
 
03:47:59.550 --> 03:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and we very much
 
03:48:01.870 --> 03:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill it really is a pretty
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
disturbing Bill uh two points first of
 
03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
all towns are already preempted from any
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
kind of gun regulation as several people
 
03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
have stated uh the current law is very
 
03:48:14.110 --> 03:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and and there's no need
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
for any new any new
 
03:48:19.269 --> 03:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
legislation but uh local governing
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
bodies do have the authority to control
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
the use of town property that is a
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
pretty basic and obvious
 
03:48:29.229 --> 03:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
proposition this bill would override
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
that it says there can be no regulation
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the use of firearms on Town property
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
not not talking here about possession
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the use of firearms on
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
Town property under this bill people
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
would have an absolute right for example
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
to set up a shooting range on a
 
03:48:50.469 --> 03:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
town-owned athletic field in a town
 
03:48:53.149 --> 03:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
Cemetery in a town forest or anywhere
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
else um it even says that a private
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
entity that leases town-owned property
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
cannot regulate the use of firearms so
 
03:49:03.070 --> 03:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
if a town owns some fields that it
 
03:49:05.149 --> 03:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
leases to a local farmer which is a
 
03:49:07.389 --> 03:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
fairly common practice in New Hampshire
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
the farmer could not restrict the use
 
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
guns on that property the second Point
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I want to mention is the way this
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill treats local officials by
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
subjecting them to fines and damages of
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
up to
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 plus attorney fees if they make
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
an innocent mistake Selectmen and City
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
councilors and Alderman are just average
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
people uh every one of them is a
 
03:49:34.990 --> 03:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer trying to do something for
 
03:49:38.269 --> 03:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
their town and they're not legal experts
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
occasionally they adopt an ordinance or
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
a regulation that turns out to be
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
invalid that's called a mistake and when
 
03:49:48.990 --> 03:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
it happens it is very quickly corrected
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
by the town attorney or in some cases by
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
a court that is the enforcement
 
03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism not helpful to have the state
 
03:49:56.960 --> 03:49:59.030 align:start position:0%
mechanism not helpful to have the state
legislature

03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%

2011 and signed by Governor Lynch at the
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%

speeding laws um other laws it would be
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
a double standard to allow elected
 
03:52:35.910 --> 03:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
officials not to to sorry to violate
 
03:52:39.070 --> 03:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
state law and not be punished we are
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
asking that you extend the current law
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure everybody's held to the
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
same standard when it comes to complying
 
03:52:47.550 --> 03:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
with the laws that are passed and
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
conquered and this bill does just that
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
it puts a penalty for those who
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
knowingly violate state law I would ask
 
03:53:01.149 --> 03:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:03.550 --> 03:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you for for your testimony
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%

excused

03:53:18.389 --> 03:53:18.399 align:start position:0%

03:53:56.349 --> 03:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
um I am in um I am in opposition to uh
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
house build 307 I'm going to briefly
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
read what I already sent in as written
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
testimony if you don't mind um it seems
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
to me that the goal of legislation is to
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
improve the health welfare and safety of
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
the constituency it covers I believe
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
that house bill 307 is the antithesis of
 
03:54:18.070 --> 03:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
this um advocates for guns on campus
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
pushed the undocumented belief that
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
empowering armed civilians would help
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
them defend themselves and others from
 
03:54:26.349 --> 03:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
Mortal danger there have been no
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
documented cases of carrier intervention
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere on campuses in this country
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
there have been no discernable deterrent
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
Effects by campus carriers what there
 
03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
has been is an increase in
 
03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted suicide by gun on on
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
campus carries schools this makes sense
 
03:54:46.349 --> 03:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
the more guns and the ready availability
 
03:54:48.590 --> 03:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
the higher the suicide
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
rate um firearms on campus negatively
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
impact teaching as instructors have been
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
compelled to change their practices to
 
03:54:59.070 --> 03:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
avoid sensitive or controversial topics
 
03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
so as to not inflame the sensibilities
 
03:55:03.990 --> 03:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
of prone students and neurobiologists
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
and Educators all agree that young minds
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
are still developing and prone to
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
impulsivity when in up till the early
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
20s or through their
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
20s I would like to say do we really
 
03:55:17.070 --> 03:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
want to convert our schools and colleges
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
and armed zones where a bad day for a
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
student or staff member who's carrying a
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
gun could really become a bad day for
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
others uh the majority of current campus
 
03:55:29.950 --> 03:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
carry schools throughout the country
 
03:55:32.910 --> 03:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
have not supported legislation that was
 
03:55:34.950 --> 03:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately imposed upon them permitting
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
firearms on campus I've put my hands
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
into to the thorax of people who have
 
03:55:42.790 --> 03:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
shot themselves I don't know how many of
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
you have done that I've also helped talk
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
to parents when their child was killed I
 
03:55:51.149 --> 03:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you have done
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
that it kind of bothers me that I see so
 
03:55:58.309 --> 03:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
many Advocates talking about their love
 
03:56:02.670 --> 03:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
of cold metal above the love of warm
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
blood Mr Sing I want to thank you for
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh we did your two
 
03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands
 
03:56:25.710 --> 03:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
Mullen good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
03:56:40.830 --> 03:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Mullen and I'm from Grafton
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I'm the nor Eastern
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
State's assistant
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
manager for the Congressional
 
03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
Sportsman's Foundation uh the 501c3
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit I represent today I'm
 
03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
addressing you to express my support for
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
house B 307 I will be submitting written
 
03:56:58.750 --> 03:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
testimony as well so out of respect for
 
03:57:01.469 --> 03:57:01.479 align:start position:0%
your time I will keep my testimony short
 
03:57:03.790 --> 03:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh broadly speaking State preemption for
 
03:57:06.670 --> 03:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
firearms ammunition and knives furthers
 
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh further serves to ass uh protect
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens from the risk of
 
03:57:13.870 --> 03:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
offending uh differing rules as they
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
travel through varying locations uh
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
arguably the most important principle of
 
03:57:21.550 --> 03:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
preemption uh is the equal distribution
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
of the law um I'm supportive of House
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 307 as it serves to further deter
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
discrepancies from locality to locality
 
03:57:32.349 --> 03:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh ensuring that all gun and knife
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
owners within New Hampshire have these
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
equal rights uh once again I'd like to
 
03:57:40.110 --> 03:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
reiterate my support for House Bill 307
 
03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
and I will get my written testimony to
 
03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
the committee uh following this meeting
 
03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr Mullen for your
 
03:57:53.469 --> 03:57:53.479 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:02.670 --> 03:58:02.680 align:start position:0%

03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jay simpkin
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
resident of Nash New Hampshire I'm a
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
federally licensed Firearms dealer and
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
an international economic consultant
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
want to address some points that have
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
been made but need
 
03:58:42.750 --> 03:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
rebuttal uh first there seems to be an
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
implicit assumption that more guns
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
equals more violence and More Death not
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
so in 1980 there were approximately 150
 
03:58:54.670 --> 03:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
million firearms in the US excluding
 
03:58:59.309 --> 03:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
military items at end 2018 there were
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
423 million Firearms US Department of
 
03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
Justice Firearms Commerce in the United
 
03:59:09.670 --> 03:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
States issues of 2000 and 200
 
03:59:12.830 --> 03:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
19 in that time the homicide rate went
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
from 10.2 for 100,000 to
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
5.0 Source FBI uniform well crime in the
 
03:59:27.550 --> 03:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
United States for each of those years so
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
the idea that more guns equals more
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
death and more violence not sell second
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as I pointed out on a
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
previous Bill the state has has been
 
03:59:44.189 --> 03:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
since 2001 at least the third safest and
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the second safest state in the
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
Union so the idea that more guns in New
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire means more violence not so
 
03:59:57.469 --> 03:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
Source FBI crime in the United States
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
for each of those years usually table
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
four next the bill as drafted does have
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
many language defects as an attorney
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
point out those should be
 
04:00:13.870 --> 04:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
fixed next point there is in the United
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
States sadly a trend towards public
 
04:00:19.750 --> 04:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
officials elected and appointed bringing
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
into their offices their personal
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
agendas thus they wish to abuse their
 
04:00:29.870 --> 04:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
public office to carry out things that
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
may be desirable or not
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
but I want to thank thank the member of
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
the public for their testimony uh you to
 
04:00:41.710 --> 04:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
expired seeing no no questions the

04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.990 --> 04:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
ITA thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%

testify before you for the record I am
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh Daniel itah residing in Manchester
 
04:01:14.349 --> 04:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire former representative I'd
 
04:01:16.750 --> 04:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
like to snap you back to what the issue
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
truly at hand and while Firearms are the
 
04:01:22.349 --> 04:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle the issue is really the
 
04:01:24.590 --> 04:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislature enforcing the Constitution
 
04:01:26.149 --> 04:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
upon the cities and
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
towns uh part one article 12 last
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
sentence nor are the inhabitants of this
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
state controllable by any other laws in
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
those to which they or their
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative have given their
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
consent part two article two the supreme
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
legislative power within this state
 
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
should be vested in the Senate and House
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
of Representatives it is about you
 
04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the towns counties and
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
school districts do not act under the
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
color of law now I've recognized that
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
there are problems with the way that
 
04:02:00.110 --> 04:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
this bill has been crafted however you
 
04:02:02.429 --> 04:02:02.439 align:start position:0%
also have at hand RSA
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
643 colon 1 official oppression you
 
04:02:10.269 --> 04:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
could link such violation to that law
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that would actually limit the
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
financial liability of the Bad actors uh
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
because it'd be limited to uh
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
$2,500 the penalty for a
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um I would advise you to uh
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
go forward with this effort and ensure
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the cities and towns counties uh do
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
not violate the constitution by acting
 
04:02:36.429 --> 04:02:36.439 align:start position:0%
under the color of law I'd be happy to
 
04:02:40.670 --> 04:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony seeing No
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
leage just a reminder your testimony is
 
04:03:02.189 --> 04:03:02.199 align:start position:0%

04:03:04.990 --> 04:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon um can everyone
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
hear me yes we can okay my name is
 
04:03:09.750 --> 04:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
Lauren paig I am the New Hampshire state
 
04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
director um for the National Rifle
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
Association we are in strong support of
 
04:03:16.870 --> 04:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 307 it's one of our top
 
04:03:19.229 --> 04:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
priorities session State Firearms
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
preemption was enacted by the new ham
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General Court to avoid a
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
confusing Patchwork of firearm laws
 
04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
across the state over recent years
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
numerous local governments have
 
04:03:29.670 --> 04:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
attempted to enact gun Control
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances in violation of this law the
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
potential for a myriad of local firearm
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
laws makes compliance very difficult and
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
near impossible for law abiding gun
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
owners this creates a situation where
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
gun owners and Sportsmen have difficulty
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
even knowing uh about certain laws much
 
04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
less understanding where they apply
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
within the city limits um I would just
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
point out that New Hampshire has 234
 
04:03:57.070 --> 04:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
established municipalities and it's
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to imagine a
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
workable system if we had 234 different
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
sets of firearm laws across the state
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:10.710 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:12.510 --> 04:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative B you recognized for a
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
you uh for your
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
testimony I know for a fact that other
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
states uh have these types of uh laws of
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you could point out one
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
or two of the states that have this and
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
how things haven't gone the heck and you
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
know how everybody survived and it's
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
better for the people of those States so
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
I think New Hampshire should have this
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
happy to um Indiana is one state where
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
we supported a preemption bill in that
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
state um it's just important to note
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
this isn't expanding preemption I mean
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
preemption is the state law this is
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
setting up an enforcement mechanism for
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
it so that these um violations are
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
addressed I'd be happy to provide a list
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the committee of the states that have
 
04:05:02.830 --> 04:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
similar laws and sort of the impacts of
 
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised the
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:23.670 --> 04:05:23.680 align:start position:0%

04:07:12.560 --> 04:07:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
yourself uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
fine Representatives um I am
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative John Bert
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.469 --> 04:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
39 uh Mr chairman I'm introducing this
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
bill uh because it is basically it's a
 
04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
real easy bill it's
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
housekeeping so I can't imagine you know
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
much opposition on this bill because
 
04:08:01.389 --> 04:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
currently we have constitutional
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
carry now there is a fishing game
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
law I believe it's
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
25- a Col
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
20 that forbids anybody on a
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
four-wheeler or snowmobile from carrying
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
a loaded
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
pistol with constitutional
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
carry the New Hampshire AGS already
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
instructed the fishing game that if they
 
04:08:29.429 --> 04:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
arrest anybody on this it's going to be
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
thrown out because constitutional
 
04:08:34.030 --> 04:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
carryer will supersede this law so this
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
is basically just a clean up they want
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
to you know get rid of this off the
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
books and that's all this is it just
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
puts us in line for constitutional carry
 
04:08:47.229 --> 04:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
which uh we have and it's current law
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Tru thank you Mr
 
04:08:56.790 --> 04:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative take
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
my question if that's the correct uh
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game law
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
25820 is that a fishing game Ru ruling
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that is that is that an RSA that's an
 
04:09:13.469 --> 04:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
actual RSA that fishing game
 
04:09:18.750 --> 04:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.109 --> 04:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
Mr I believe it was Senate Bill 500
 
04:09:42.070 --> 04:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
100 um two terms ago uh rep Senator
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
avard put in and it passed it is current
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
law that took care of the rifles and
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
long you know long guns in that section
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill this is my second time with
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill because the Senate two terms
 
04:10:00.750 --> 04:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
ago said that it took care of this
 
04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
particular law so that's why they didn't
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
pass it through and they have since seen
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
oops uh that is not correct so the law
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
is still there Senate Bill 500 did not
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
remove this like it we they thought it
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
would yeah so that's why uh rifles and
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
long guns are not included in here it's
 
04:10:20.880 --> 04:10:25.309 align:start position:0%
long guns are not included in here it's
only

04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%

written it is very simple and it does
 
04:11:21.990 --> 04:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
quite frankly keep a lot of um police
 
04:11:24.189 --> 04:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
officers and prosecutors from wasting
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
their time because what happens is they
 
04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
arrest someone they charge them they
 
04:11:29.550 --> 04:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
determine they can't prosecute them they
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
made the person spend a lot of money and
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
go through a lot of grief and this is
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
going to allow what should be and what's
 
04:11:38.349 --> 04:11:38.359 align:start position:0%

334 and I want to emphasize that um this
 
04:14:55.870 --> 04:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
is probably the simplest most least
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
controversial Bill you're going to deal
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
with probably maybe in the whole
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
two-year term uh people can carry loaded
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%

in their pickup trucks on their boats
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
but if they want to carry it on their
 
04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
snow machine they need a license very
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the rest of the laws
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I would urge the committee to vote
 
04:15:21.149 --> 04:15:21.159 align:start position:0%

04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
your uh thank you Mr chairman just very
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
briefly again this is just a
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill uh they thought Senate
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 500 was going to take care of that
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh two terms ago and it
 
04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
didn't so the AG has you know said that
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know we need to uh clean up some
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
language here um so it's just basically
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping bill and I hope that
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
everybody will support it um because
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.510 --> 04:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
bill chairman I open this up open the
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
question up for discussion
 
04:18:46.269 --> 04:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative huse you
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you Mr chairman I just
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we we note who
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
didn't testify today so there was nobody
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
here from game and I think in previous
 
04:19:01.950 --> 04:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
hearings on similar bills we have heard
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
from folks in fishing game one of the
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
things that we didn't necessarily hear
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
is why we had a law like this on the
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
books in the first place um and my guess
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
is that we had a law like this on the
 
04:19:15.550 --> 04:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
books in the first place because there's
 
04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
a better chance on on things like
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and ATVs of weapons being
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
discharged uh accidentally and
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
potentially not only harming the person
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
who's driving the ATV or the snowmobile
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
but potentially other people in the area
 
04:19:35.149 --> 04:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
as well uh and I believe hunting from
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
ATVs and and snowmobiles I think was
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
another issue that was brought up in the
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
past um so I I just wanted to make sure
 
04:19:47.149 --> 04:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
that everyone understands that um there
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
actually are some issues worth debating
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
here and it's not just purely a
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
you representative G you recognize this
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
um you plan on Z anything else today you
 
04:20:10.750 --> 04:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
think because in our conversation you
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
were very explicit in saying that you we
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
were not exec anything it's unlikely
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have time to exec
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
anything have a 1:30 we have a public
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
hearing at 1:30
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
that we also have to uh we we have to
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
adjourn today by 4M due to maintenance
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
so we have three more bills scheduled uh
 
04:20:34.950 --> 04:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
given the length of time I I can imagine
 
04:20:37.550 --> 04:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
the other house we heard today I highly
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
doubt that it would be appropriate to
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
open those executive sessions knowing we
 
04:20:46.830 --> 04:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
to representative Marson thank you Mr
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
chairman I only wish to comment on this
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is no law that says you have to
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
take your gun with you on your
 
04:21:05.149 --> 04:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
snowmobile machine if you feel you might
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
home represent is your hand raised yes I
 
04:21:22.630 --> 04:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
did I just would like to say that I will
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
be voting against this because this bill
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
belonged in fishing game because they
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
are the ones that control the
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
representative W thank you Mr chairman
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh just like to make the point that um
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game is well aware of this bill
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh for those of you who have S served on
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
this committee for more than one term we
 
04:21:54.510 --> 04:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
all know that if fishing game had a
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other they would
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
have a representative here or online and
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
they don't and I think that speaks
 
04:22:02.950 --> 04:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
volumes and um additionally this bill is
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
about Firearms not ohrv so it's
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely in the prop committee thank
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Hopper thank you Mr
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um having served on the fishing
 
04:22:18.070 --> 04:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
game committee for quite a few years I
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
legislation restricting firearms and
 
04:22:27.550 --> 04:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles and and a lot of that stemmed
 
04:22:30.269 --> 04:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
back to the early
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
1900s when um people would just drive
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
down the road in their car and shoot
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
deer on the side of the road road so uh
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
I I presume it has something to do with
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
that type of behavior that is long gone
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think this will have I think
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's a great Bill thank
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
you represent did shair may ask
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
questions so my understanding is it
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
would still remain illegal to ride on a
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
snowmobile and discharge a firearm for
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
hunting purp that would still remain a
 
04:23:07.109 --> 04:23:07.119 align:start position:0%
crime yeah would
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
still illegal to be on a motorized
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
vehicle I think that's under federal law
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
that might just be duck I'm not sure but
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know of any law that allows
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%

helicopter or an airplane uh for the
 
04:23:45.109 --> 04:23:45.119 align:start position:0%
purposes of hog hunting which we don't
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.830 --> 04:23:58.840 align:start position:0%

04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
live this time the criminal justice

04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes I had a question of the chair will
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
we be having exec executive sessions
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill that's a good question there are
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
two other bills scheduled thereafter if
 
04:42:30.990 --> 04:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
there's time I will say that for the
 
04:42:33.150 --> 04:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
bills this morning I would highly doubt
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we would have the executive session
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
on any of those
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
bills I believe the executive session
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
would be much longer and the
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
discussion it take take a while I I
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
think with the other bills scheduled
 
04:42:46.000 --> 04:42:46.910 align:start position:0%
think with the other bills scheduled
this

04:42:46.910 --> 04:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon we might be able to exec some
 
04:42:51.910 --> 04:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
of these bills depending on how the
 
04:42:51.920 --> 04:42:52.830 align:start position:0%
of these bills depending on how the
hearings

04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
going second question I only have one
 
04:42:56.878 --> 04:42:57.868 align:start position:0%
going second question I only have one
bill

04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
listed um in the
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%

04:43:03.600 --> 04:43:05.150 align:start position:0%
calendar did you say there was two
others

04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes the original notice omitted two of
 
04:43:10.350 --> 04:43:10.360 align:start position:0%

04:44:42.560 --> 04:44:44.190 align:start position:0%
 
did

04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%

represent representative
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%

04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:09.390 align:start position:0%
 
recognize

04:45:09.390 --> 04:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%

04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:37.310 --> 04:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry is there a way for me to add
 
04:45:41.230 --> 04:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
my video or
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeses assist the witness
 
04:45:47.550 --> 04:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
and activating
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
live I see no options Mr chairman I
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
think it has to be on her side which she
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
would say it says stop or start video if
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
I if I may just chime in she would just
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
need to be promoted to a panelist order
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
to start her
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:04.788 align:start position:0%
to start her
video

04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
video
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
just oh there she
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
is all right but she's
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
muted let me unmute her
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
sorry still warning over you you're
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
recognized for your testimony thank you
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Sharon thank you members of
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
the committee um so my name is
 
04:46:24.430 --> 04:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative Jacqueline cran I'm one
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
of two representatives of Hillsboro
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
District 42 in Manchester um and I'm
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
here today to give my testimony on HB
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
620 requiring law enforcement agencies
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
together and analyze certain demographic
 
04:46:37.470 --> 04:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
information um at police stops and
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
searches so I filed this bill uh in part
 
04:46:42.750 --> 04:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
in response to the Lea recommendations
 
04:46:44.430 --> 04:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
that came out last year uh which
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
governor sununu and many members of the
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement Community have
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
stated that they support unequivocally
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
um this item was also included in the
 
04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
cost black lives matter requests for
 
04:46:57.230 --> 04:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
reform um so my belief is that this
 
04:47:00.030 --> 04:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
topic has broad bipartisan support um so
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
one of the leak's action items for the
 
04:47:04.110 --> 04:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
legislature was to implement some
 
04:47:05.708 --> 04:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
requirements for police to collect
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
information about the race and gender of
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
any person who they were stopping or
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
searching regardless of the outcome of
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
that stop or search um So currently as
 
04:47:15.868 --> 04:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you know uh this information is
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
only available for stops or searches
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
where further action is taken and
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
collecting data for all stops is
 
04:47:24.788 --> 04:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
important uh because right now we just
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
don't have clear empirical information
 
04:47:29.070 --> 04:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
on who is being policed and at what
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
rates um so my background I'm a
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
scientist um and that means I'm keenly
 
04:47:35.708 --> 04:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
aware of the issue of sampling bias um
 
04:47:37.390 --> 04:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
so if you're searching for your keys
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
under the street light that's where
 
04:47:40.670 --> 04:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to find them right um so if
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
we're spending 90% of our time looking
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
for Crime among certain communities then
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going to find it uh
 
04:47:48.830 --> 04:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
so it's important to know whether our
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
policing resources are being applied
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
proportionately um we also don't know
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
whether all demographics interactions
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
with the police lead to similar outcomes
 
04:47:59.948 --> 04:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
at similar rates um or if there's
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
similar systematic differences um in
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
those rates uh we do know that at least
 
04:48:06.948 --> 04:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
as of 2014 uh the last time I'm aware
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
that this was looked at Black and
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hispanic people were arrested and
 
04:48:11.948 --> 04:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at higher rates in New
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than whites um and at more
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
disproportionate rates than are seen
 
04:48:18.990 --> 04:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and other states um
 
04:48:20.670 --> 04:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
particularly I think this issue is
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
important for accountability um the New
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Safety and State
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
Police have an explicit impartial
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
policing policy um that prohibits stops
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
or detentions based on race Etc um but
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism currently in place
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
to report on how well this policy is
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
being adhered to which makes it
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to know uh how well the the
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
understanding of this policy is is
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
implemented among law enforcement and
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
whether uh we need additional resources
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
or clarification on that um and further
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to mention so the current
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill does not require um or even request
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
reporting at the level of individual
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
officers um but my hope is that the
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
availability of this information
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
internally U might help law enforcement
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors um identify outliers who
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
might benefit from help uh there's also
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
some evidence that even just the simple
 
04:49:13.230 --> 04:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
Act of tracking this information might
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
help individual officers notice um you
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
know if there are unconscious patterns
 
04:49:18.910 --> 04:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
in their behavior sort of like if you're
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
tracking your internet usage you realize
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
how much time you're spending watching
 
04:49:24.948 --> 04:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
cat videos um just collecting this
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
information um I believe can be a tool
 
04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
to empower officers as well as for
 
04:49:29.718 --> 04:49:30.708 align:start position:0%
to empower officers as well as for
external

04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
external
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
accountability um just the last thing
 
04:49:34.750 --> 04:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to say is sorry I hope I'm
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
not going over my five minutes um but
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that there's work being done
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
in the Senate on some of the Lea
 
04:49:42.430 --> 04:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations um I absolutely don't
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
object to the contents of this bill
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
being rolled into something larger um I
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
just do want to emphasize the importance
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think of collecting and Reporting
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
demographic information um just so we
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
have a clear picture of how our our
 
04:49:56.430 --> 04:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
police resources are being applied
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
across different communities um so thank
 
04:50:00.430 --> 04:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I look forward to
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
taking your
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bert you
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative uh
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
04:50:13.390 --> 04:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
today you spoke that uh Governor sununu
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
supports uh legislation like this does
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
he support this particular legislation
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know does he appr proven of this uh
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
I have not spoken with him directly um
 
04:50:27.868 --> 04:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
however this language in this bill
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
mimics the language and the Lea
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I presume
 
04:50:32.840 --> 04:50:34.910 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I presume
so

04:50:34.910 --> 04:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative Hopper thank you uh Mr
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
04:50:41.430 --> 04:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
um one of the a key variable in whether
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
or not somebody does or does not
 
04:50:50.350 --> 04:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
interact with law enforcement is family
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
structure have you uh thought of adding
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
that to your list of
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
um uh demographic
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
information I had not considered
 
04:51:06.430 --> 04:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:06.440 --> 04:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:14.670 --> 04:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
Muse first of all thank you for this
 
04:51:17.470 --> 04:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um the uh the work of the
 
04:51:20.350 --> 04:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
leak commission was extremely important
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
and it's nice to see that uh that some
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
of it is finally making its way to us I
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
I do have a question about how the
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
information uh is actually collected so
 
04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
it you know where the rubber hits the
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
road is when an officer actually has to
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
put something down on paper um today we
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people uh in New Hampshire
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
and everywhere else in the country who
 
04:51:48.830 --> 04:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
are multi-racial so how how does it work
 
04:51:52.190 --> 04:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the case of somebody uh
 
04:51:55.110 --> 04:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
who might be like our former president
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
or has uh parents of uh of different
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
races does the officer does the officer
 
04:52:05.470 --> 04:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
guess does is this information taken
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else or do they just ask
 
04:52:07.240 --> 04:52:08.230 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else or do they just ask
the

04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
person so that's a really good question
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and definitely um I think a sticky point
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill and and similar legislation
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
um one suggestion that I've heard is if
 
04:52:24.548 --> 04:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
there's information on uh for example a
 
04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
driver's license about racial
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
identification that could be used
 
04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
currently I know we don't have that um
 
04:52:35.070 --> 04:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I think
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
to get to the the heart of this bill I
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
think probably the officer's perception
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
is really what's most important so I
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest that perhaps that is what
 
04:52:49.270 --> 04:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
could be used but um I did deliberately
 
04:52:52.510 --> 04:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
omit that specific um from this so that
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
the the rul making bodies can um can get
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
into that nitty-gritty themselves I
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
assume that you know the police officers
 
04:53:01.390 --> 04:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
who are out in the field U might have a
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
better idea of how they would like to
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
handle that how they would like to make
 
04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
that consistent so um I sort of leave
 
04:53:13.590 --> 04:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
you representative testman thank you Mr
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you taking my question um
 
04:53:24.270 --> 04:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
along with representative Hopper's
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
question about race and so on how do you
 
04:53:31.948 --> 04:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
it's a sensitive issue gender is
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
also uh how do I determine if I'm a
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
policeman what gender the person is that
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
I'm is in front of
 
04:53:44.750 --> 04:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
me uh thank you for that question I
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
think really similar answer um in this
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
case I think it is a little more clear
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
since that information is listed on uh
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
the person's ID so I would go with that
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
if it's available otherwise um best
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
determination or you could say not
 
04:54:02.510 --> 04:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
determinable I don't think it needs to
 
04:54:06.990 --> 04:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
be uh you know 100% perfect all the time
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:14.910 --> 04:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
anything representative GFF um while
 
04:54:16.270 --> 04:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's not up to us to make that
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
determination I'm just wondering what do
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
you think about um if the person is
 
04:54:25.150 --> 04:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
willing to give their um ID or what they
 
04:54:27.868 --> 04:54:27.878 align:start position:0%
are their gender or their race what do
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.480 --> 04:54:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:54:37.990 --> 04:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
oh sorry for me um I think that would be
 
04:54:46.350 --> 04:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
youon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking our
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
question if this bill were to pass
 
04:55:07.270 --> 04:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
how and in what way can we be assured of
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.878 --> 04:55:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
report

04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:55:16.750 --> 04:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
04:55:19.150 --> 04:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
sorry of the
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
report um I mean I think there's always
 
04:55:26.230 --> 04:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to be a a level of trust as there
 
04:55:29.110 --> 04:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
is in any sort of report that a police
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
officer prepares um I do think one
 
04:55:34.590 --> 04:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of collecting this information
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
broadly is that you know we'd be able to
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
to compare it across municipalities and
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
things like that and see if there are
 
04:55:44.788 --> 04:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
outliers so that might be a way to to
 
04:55:48.670 --> 04:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
tell if um perhaps something something
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
looks a Miss um in a particular area um
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
or again for supervisors to be able to
 
04:55:56.350 --> 04:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
look at that data you know just for
 
04:55:56.360 --> 04:55:58.990 align:start position:0%
look at that data you know just for
themselves

04:55:58.990 --> 04:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um but yes public trust you know La law
 
04:56:04.590 --> 04:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement takes an oath to to be
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
truthful on there
 
04:56:09.628 --> 04:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
report representative Hopper thank you
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative for
 
04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question the an obvious issue
 
04:56:20.430 --> 04:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
with this legislation is um uh 28a who's
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.628 --> 04:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
it so um partly I am I'm taking the the
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
governor at his word that he uh believes
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
every recommendation in the act should
 
04:56:35.070 --> 04:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
implemented you know that cost should
 
04:56:38.750 --> 04:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
not be an issue he's he's on record
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
saying that um I believe you know
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
officers collect a lot of data um a lot
 
04:56:49.030 --> 04:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
of paperwork already adding these two
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
little items and one annual report um
 
04:56:55.948 --> 04:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully is not a an enormous burden um
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me to be sensible to roll
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
this into normal operating costs as
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know designated a
 
04:57:06.110 --> 04:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
specific Revenue stream for for a single
 
04:57:08.548 --> 04:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
report and and a couple pieces of data
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
um but I'm certainly open to to other
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
suggestions if you
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:57:24.430 --> 04:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
Pratt hello there uh thank you for being
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
here today I got a question uh won't
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
people feel prosecuted if they're asked
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
to give this kind of
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
information I mean a law officer that
 
04:57:36.510 --> 04:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
they may not even trust in the first
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
place is asking them what they
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
are the beginning of prejudice is
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
putting a label on somebody
 
04:57:50.350 --> 04:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
so yeah thank you for that question I I
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
agree that that that's for sure a
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
concern um so going back to to what
 
04:57:57.868 --> 04:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
representative Muse had said about the
 
04:58:01.110 --> 04:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
the specific mechanisms for um how the
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
information is collected whether we are
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking the person to to give the
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
information or um just going by the
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
officer's estimation or going by a
 
04:58:13.628 --> 04:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
record on an ID um if that's available
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
for sure something to to consider in the
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
implementation um I didn't want to get
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
into to all that in the RSA but
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah does that answer your concern or
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.510 --> 04:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.520 --> 04:58:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:58:38.070 --> 04:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:58:43.948 --> 04:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
Mr um thank you for taking my question
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of here list the agencies
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
contacted were these um agencies also a
 
04:58:54.430 --> 04:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
know um somewhere I'm sorry to
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
look um yes I believe all of them
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
were I guess I'm not 100% sure about the
 
04:59:07.548 --> 04:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
the counties and the municipal
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
Association but I believe believe that
 
04:59:12.430 --> 04:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
yes all four of those
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands raised the
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
chair would thank the witness for our
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
much Joseph
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
Ebert you recognize by the chair to

hearing uh testimony will be limited to
 
04:59:55.040 --> 04:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
hearing uh testimony will be limited to
two

04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon members of the
 
04:59:59.310 --> 04:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee it's good to be back in front
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
of you again today if even uh virtually
 
05:00:03.910 --> 05:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Joseph berbert
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
EBT I'm a captain with the state police
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and I want to Echo some of the uh the
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
very healthy discussion that uh was just
 
05:00:13.830 --> 05:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
had but I want to start by saying the uh
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
the colonel of the State Police as well
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner uh wholly support
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
the vision of the leak committee um so
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
having said that I I think
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's uh uh uh point is
 
05:00:28.190 --> 05:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
one that's well taken and one that we
 
05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
have concern over which is uh the
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
determination of race uh I somebody uh
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
brought the uh brought up the
 
05:00:39.390 --> 05:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
conversation of how that would go as to
 
05:00:42.190 --> 05:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
asking somebody their race um and uh in
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
in past hearings I know it's it's it's
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
been discussed that especially uh once
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
that individual is uh uh has been
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
notified of whatever offense they're
 
05:00:54.430 --> 05:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
alleged to have committed could that uh
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
lead to that interaction being uh poor
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I suppose that's all in uh in
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
how it's presented um but more
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
importantly uh
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm concerned about is if we
 
05:01:08.910 --> 05:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
rely on the officer's estimation uh then
 
05:01:11.868 --> 05:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
the information may be inaccurate um and
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I would be as an agency we
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
would be looking for the most accurate
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
way um and I don't know what that is I I
 
05:01:22.910 --> 05:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
I truly don't um but I wonder uh what
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
other states are doing and how they've
 
05:01:28.590 --> 05:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh accomplished this statistical
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
Gathering so uh the uh the second issue
 
05:01:33.750 --> 05:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
which again was also uh discussed was
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal impact um I I think more
 
05:01:39.788 --> 05:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
than anything I would uh say and again
 
05:01:41.590 --> 05:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
this uh is something that I know that
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
has been discussed in other hearings but
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
I would uh say it here uh from my own
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
experience making changes to our
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
existing contract for records management
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
even though it it really does seem like
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
a very small thing to make a change uh
 
05:01:56.788 --> 05:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
to collect different data uh that's a
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
significant change to a contract that
 
05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
has fiscal impacts uh and I'm concerned
 
05:02:03.390 --> 05:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
about the the 60-day days from the
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill that it would take
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
to actually um put those changes in
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
place I I want to kind of conclude my
 
05:02:13.470 --> 05:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
statement by saying I don't in any way
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
want to come across nor does the State
 
05:02:18.510 --> 05:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
Police as um rebuffing this or uh trying
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
to make this a a difficult process when
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh or more difficult than it needs to be
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure
 
05:02:28.910 --> 05:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
that Mr E thank you for your testimony
 
05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
the two minutes has expired uh however
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
there there is a question by member
 
05:02:35.948 --> 05:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
representative bird thank you Mr
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you officer for
 
05:02:37.798 --> 05:02:38.670 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you officer for
your

05:02:38.670 --> 05:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um during the
 
05:02:45.190 --> 05:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
last speaker we had one question that
 
05:02:48.548 --> 05:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
came up from a representative about and
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
it it just made me think about this a
 
05:02:52.830 --> 05:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
lot so I just want to ever since you're
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
out in the field what your experience
 
05:02:57.750 --> 05:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
may be on
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
this there are some people that you know
 
05:03:03.628 --> 05:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not one of them but for some reason
 
05:03:05.070 --> 05:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're scared to death of the
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
police when they pull up behind them and
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know I guess I understand some of
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that so what's going to happen if they
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
start profiling because that's what
 
05:03:16.830 --> 05:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
almost this is doing is you know they're
 
05:03:19.628 --> 05:03:19.638 align:start position:0%
profiling the individual to see what
 
05:03:22.270 --> 05:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
race they are and other items that they
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
have to list how do you think that's
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
going to interact with the officer and
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
the person being pulled over so I I
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
think that um it could present a uh a
 
05:03:38.430 --> 05:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
difficult interaction um you know I I
 
05:03:41.310 --> 05:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
think ideally we would know uh as was
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in the previous discussion
 
05:03:44.708 --> 05:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
we would know the race of the individual
 
05:03:46.830 --> 05:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
by uh the document that they present to
 
05:03:50.110 --> 05:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
us and I say that I uh in an ideal sense
 
05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
because I my understanding of that would
 
05:03:55.150 --> 05:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
be that that's how they're declaring um
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
and the how to determine that the
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
veracity of that I guess is is a is
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
another dis uh discussion but ideally it
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
we would uh we would know the race of
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
the individual based on the document
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
that they present us and could it uh
 
05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
lead to uh you know a further difficult
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
interaction yes I I think it could
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's something that uh could
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
be overcome as
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman inquire of the witness and I
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
want to thank you in advance for taking
 
05:04:24.120 --> 05:04:25.110 align:start position:0%
want to thank you in advance for taking
my

05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:04:28.350 --> 05:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
question when it comes to Gathering the
 
05:04:31.110 --> 05:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
data in I suppose
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
classifying uh different
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
races will it be consistent with
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
classifications for example like that
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
censes um respectfully sir uh chairman I
 
05:04:47.390 --> 05:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't I truly don't know uh that
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
that may be a way to get at that
 
05:04:51.628 --> 05:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
information I think that's that's one
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
thing that um and maybe a creative way
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
to to to figure out uh how to identify
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
individuals um without having the uh not
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
confrontation but without having the
 
05:05:04.830 --> 05:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
interaction that representative Bert was
 
05:05:07.150 --> 05:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
referring to on the side of the road so
 
05:05:09.510 --> 05:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the census is uh a mechanism
 
05:05:12.350 --> 05:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
with which to um to Garner that
 
05:05:14.070 --> 05:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
information how that gets from the
 
05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
Census to uh the information that that
 
05:05:18.230 --> 05:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
officer would be dealing with or that
 
05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
Trooper would be dealing with roadside
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
um that I'm I'm not particularly sure
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
of and just a just a follow question and
 
05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
the concern that I I have is not with
 
05:05:30.750 --> 05:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
with the intention of the bill I can use
 
05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
myself as an example I've seen a lot in
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
just my short time as a member of this
 
05:05:37.948 --> 05:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
body seen several bills come before this
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee and uh some bills will
 
05:05:42.510 --> 05:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
classify me as one race and some will
 
05:05:44.470 --> 05:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
classify myself as another race and I
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
notice those inconsistencies which be
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
very confusing for someone like myself
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
especially with asked what is my race so
 
05:05:53.708 --> 05:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out if if you
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
to GA the the
 
05:05:58.030 --> 05:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
data consistency and I was just kind of
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
using the census as an example that
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
maybe would be whatever when when they
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
gather information just for
 
05:06:07.470 --> 05:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
classification purposes I'm just
 
05:06:09.430 --> 05:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if if that's or would it be
 
05:06:11.788 --> 05:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
more specific now for example Caucasian
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
is a classification within the Caucasian
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
classification is white is a
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
race yes um so I guess sorry that that's
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
not something I could uh 100% speak to
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm not sure the categories
 
05:06:28.830 --> 05:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
with which have been outlined uh to
 
05:06:31.470 --> 05:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
collect uh what I can tell you though is
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
um your your own experience um uh is is
 
05:06:38.310 --> 05:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
what I is what I worry about so I
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
clearly I want the information that is
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
provided to be accurate and I don't
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
think that the issue will be the
 
05:06:45.470 --> 05:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
veracity of the statement of the officer
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
to say this is uh the race of the person
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
that I believe that I was looking at I I
 
05:06:54.190 --> 05:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
I think the uh where the possibility for
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
error comes in is whether you identify
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
somebody and and one population that I
 
05:07:01.868 --> 05:07:01.878 align:start position:0%
heard referred to previously so I will
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
I'll use that as an example but somebody
 
05:07:06.990 --> 05:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
who um is of Dominican descent are they
 
05:07:10.470 --> 05:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
being identified as being um black or
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
they being identified as being something
 
05:07:14.190 --> 05:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
other than that and I think that that's
 
05:07:16.270 --> 05:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
a really difficult distinction for
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
somebody to make on the side of the road
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and and again it's not this is not
 
05:07:23.390 --> 05:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
push back from wanting to have what
 
05:07:25.350 --> 05:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
could be a difficult conversation it's
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's just wanting to make sure that that
 
05:07:30.628 --> 05:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
there isn't um error in the information
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we are providing that's going to be
 
05:07:35.910 --> 05:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
be thank you for taking my question
 
05:07:40.430 --> 05:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Muse yes thank you for
 
05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I wonder if there
 
05:07:44.910 --> 05:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
isn't a way around this I'm a little bit
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with the with the database
 
05:07:50.548 --> 05:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
projects and things of that nature and
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh adding one field sometimes is as easy
 
05:07:56.910 --> 05:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
as adding adding 20 so given the fact
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
that virtually any of the ways that
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about collecting this data
 
05:08:04.510 --> 05:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
would be imperfect in some way um
 
05:08:06.110 --> 05:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's identification by the
 
05:08:09.150 --> 05:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
police officer whether it's an ID card
 
05:08:11.470 --> 05:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
that may not have the particular
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
classifications that we're looking for
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
yet uh whether it's information from the
 
05:08:18.350 --> 05:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
accused themselves that may or may not
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
be true that the issue is is it's hard
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
to get to a point where we ever really
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
know for sure so one of the things that
 
05:08:28.030 --> 05:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that strikes me that we we we could
 
05:08:30.070 --> 05:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
potentially do with something like this
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
is just add another field that indicates
 
05:08:34.750 --> 05:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
how the data was collected so for
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
instance give the officer a chance to
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
say uh I got you know it came from an
 
05:08:43.270 --> 05:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
identification you know check it came
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
from the suspect check or it came from
 
05:08:50.590 --> 05:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
me and that way we would know uh we
 
05:08:53.030 --> 05:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
would have the identification and we
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
would also have have some idea of how
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
the data was collected and that
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
additional data might actually be useful
 
05:08:59.878 --> 05:09:01.110 align:start position:0%
additional data might actually be useful
as

05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
well representa is there a question for
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
answer if that would address the
 
05:09:13.920 --> 05:09:15.628 align:start position:0%
answer if that would address the
captain's

05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
captain's
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
concerns so representative Muse thank
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
you so much for um uh for that and I I
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
do think that that is something um that
 
05:09:27.150 --> 05:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
that may help to address uh the concerns
 
05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily of just myself but of
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the division of State Police um the
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh the the only thing I would reiterate
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a really ingenious way
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of um look at a couple of
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
different data sets um the only concern
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
that I would re reiterate is that I
 
05:09:47.548 --> 05:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
would want uh field a to be just as
 
05:09:49.948 --> 05:09:49.958 align:start position:0%
powerful as field B and my concern is
 
05:09:52.030 --> 05:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
that one would take precedence over the
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
other um it should be uh the the method
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
of identification should be uh in in my
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
estimation should be reviewed just as
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
much as the identification itself so
 
05:10:04.510 --> 05:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
that the two are handled hand inand and
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
if that were in fact the uh the way to
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
move forward perhaps that is and that's
 
05:10:12.190 --> 05:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
far above my uh my level but perhaps
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is uh kind of an ingenious way to
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
try and get around what seems to be the
 
05:10:17.000 --> 05:10:18.788 align:start position:0%
try and get around what seems to be the
inherent

05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
inherent
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
issue thank
 
05:10:23.788 --> 05:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
question um earlier you made reference
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
to and I didn't write it all down but uh
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
a cost
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
to change the data collection contract
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that do you have any
 
05:10:41.070 --> 05:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
idea what that cost would
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
be I I can't say what that cost would be
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that anybody could um
 
05:10:49.548 --> 05:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
for the entire State of New Hampshire
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is I am aware uh
 
05:10:54.510 --> 05:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of disparate
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
records Management Systems throughout
 
05:10:58.110 --> 05:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so lots of
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
police departments use lots of different
 
05:11:01.548 --> 05:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
records Management systems and some
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
police dep departments have no records
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
Management systems and rely upon Excel
 
05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets um and things of that
 
05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
nature to keep their uh their
 
05:11:11.948 --> 05:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
information and while that may seem
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
really outdated to us um that that is a
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
reality I think for some of our
 
05:11:20.548 --> 05:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
communities so what what I can say is uh
 
05:11:22.548 --> 05:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
there is a cost that is incurred with
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
that and it's it's not necessarily uh
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
the changing of a field uh that is uh so
 
05:11:30.750 --> 05:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
difficult but it is the uh changing of
 
05:11:32.948 --> 05:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
the contract that exists
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh and what I what I can also speak to
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
is the state of New Hampshire uh under
 
05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police has been in
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
an RMS um purchasing process for for
 
05:11:44.230 --> 05:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
almost two years now looking at What
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
fields to collect and how to collect
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
them uh so it's been a very extensive
 
05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
process and and I would imagine by the
 
05:11:52.150 --> 05:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
time we get to the end of that sir we're
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to have a pretty Ironclad uh
 
05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
contract that says this is what's
 
05:11:58.628 --> 05:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
expected of our provider going back to
 
05:12:00.910 --> 05:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
them and making Chang uh changes to that
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
is like as in any contract is going to
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
cost is going to have a fiscal impact
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm worried both for the state side
 
05:12:10.990 --> 05:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
but also for the local municipalities
 
05:12:13.270 --> 05:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
that that impact may be overwhelming and
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
again I I I can't speak to what it would
 
05:12:16.990 --> 05:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
be because it would differ for every
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
Community throughout the state um who
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
had a different RMS
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Hopper quick one uh
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you officer for taking my
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
question as do you know if local law
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement already collects information
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
every time they stop anybody or would
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
this be an entirely new
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
process so I I truly can't speak to what
 
05:12:54.190 --> 05:12:54.200 align:start position:0%
each department does especially at the
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
the local level um what I can offer you
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
as anecdotal and my hope is that there
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
will be a speaker behind me who can
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
offer uh much more evidence-based
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
testimony but what I what I can offer is
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
that I've listened to other hearings
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
where municipalities have said that
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're not currently collecting
 
05:13:13.230 --> 05:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
this information um and to do so would
 
05:13:16.830 --> 05:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
cause a change in the the process uh uh
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
that they statistically analyze their
 
05:13:22.708 --> 05:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
information by so I again I I I may just
 
05:13:24.270 --> 05:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
not be the right person to speak to the
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
local police departments as a member of
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
the State Police and I apologize for
 
05:13:31.470 --> 05:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
that representative thank you Mr
 
05:13:33.150 --> 05:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr Ebert thank you for taking
 
05:13:35.948 --> 05:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
the question it was really reassuring to
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
hear at the beginning of your testimony
 
05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
that the state police supports the leak
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations um one thing that we
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
have um we have seen is that these
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations typically have a
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
cost and that cost is often cited as a
 
05:13:56.230 --> 05:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
justification not to do something so I
 
05:13:59.070 --> 05:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering um do you have any
 
05:14:01.270 --> 05:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
concern given your the agency support
 
05:14:04.990 --> 05:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
for Le act that cost could be uh a
 
05:14:07.030 --> 05:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
reason why none of this gets done none
 
05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
of these recommendations take
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
effect so uh thank you for the question
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
representative and and I think um
 
05:14:18.510 --> 05:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
if if my testimony has come across as uh
 
05:14:22.830 --> 05:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
that a fiscal uh a fiscal note is a
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
reason not to do something that's not at
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
all what I intended uh the purpose of
 
05:14:30.910 --> 05:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
bringing up the the fiscal attachment is
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
to try and generate a discussion as to
 
05:14:35.948 --> 05:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
where that funding would come from where
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
it would best come from um and also to
 
05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
discuss the the 60-day timeline that's
 
05:14:42.670 --> 05:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
attached because I I do think regardless
 
05:14:44.030 --> 05:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
of where that funding comes from that
 
05:14:47.470 --> 05:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
60-day timeline is is very restrictive
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
um so it is not in my estimation uh as
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
was uh previously said that the governor
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
endorsed it the finance should not be uh
 
05:14:59.548 --> 05:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
the reason that this does not go forward
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
but I do think it should be part of the
 
05:15:02.910 --> 05:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
discussion especially when talking about
 
05:15:02.920 --> 05:15:12.310 align:start position:0%
discussion especially when talking about
a

05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:15.150 --> 05:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
timeline seeing no further questions the
 
05:15:17.310 --> 05:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
chair would thank to witness for his
 
05:15:20.590 --> 05:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so
 
05:15:22.830 --> 05:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
much chair
 
05:15:28.590 --> 05:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
Reynolds uh good afternoon can you hear
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
me uh chairman
 
05:15:35.070 --> 05:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you okay uh good
 
05:15:37.150 --> 05:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman abis and uh members
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Charles Reynolds
 
05:15:41.470 --> 05:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of the New
 
05:15:43.070 --> 05:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
05:15:45.948 --> 05:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
police to register our opposition to
 
05:15:47.430 --> 05:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:15:50.548 --> 05:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
620 I'll be brief the value and
 
05:15:53.310 --> 05:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
usefulness of accurate demographics is
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
not in question clearly not in question
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
however we find this bill presents two
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
major obstacles first in order for Dem
 
05:16:04.750 --> 05:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
Dem graphic data to be of value it must
 
05:16:07.070 --> 05:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
be accurate therefore absent the
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the requested demographic
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
data on an individual's driver's license
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
state issued or other recognized
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
identification the recording of such
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
data relies on an officer either one
 
05:16:22.750 --> 05:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
asking for the de for that
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
information which is clearly not a
 
05:16:28.030 --> 05:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
recommended practice or two recording
 
05:16:30.430 --> 05:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
his or her perception of the person's
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
race sex or other demographic data this
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
clearly leaves offices open to criticism
 
05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
for either not accurately recording or
 
05:16:42.030 --> 05:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
worse yet manipulating the data
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
therefore no matter how careful an
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
officer may be the resulting analyses
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
may be subject to challenge accordingly
 
05:16:51.750 --> 05:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
absent a requirement that demographic
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
data be included on official
 
05:16:57.548 --> 05:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
documents that may be requested by an
 
05:17:01.990 --> 05:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
officer we cannot support that provision
 
05:17:04.190 --> 05:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
second even if the data could be
 
05:17:06.510 --> 05:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
accurately recorded from the documents
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
described above the suggested analysis
 
05:17:11.830 --> 05:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
is another matter law enforcement
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
agencies in New Hampshire particularly
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
the smaller ones which comprise a
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
majority of departments do not have the
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
an analytical capacity to do so nor are
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
they likely to acquire the funds to
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
purchase new or modify existing Data
 
05:17:30.430 --> 05:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
Systems to accommodate the analysis this
 
05:17:33.070 --> 05:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislation suggest suggests accordingly
 
05:17:33.080 --> 05:17:34.070 align:start position:0%
legislation suggest suggests accordingly
for

05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:17:37.350 --> 05:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
practical operational and fiscal reasons
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of chiefs
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
of police must oppose this
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislation excuse me um Mr Reynolds we
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
have to liit testimony for two minutes
 
05:17:54.510 --> 05:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
um do any members represent
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
testman thank you thank you for taking
 
05:17:57.040 --> 05:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
testman thank you thank you for taking
my

05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
question you touched on it but the the
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill requires the the police agencies to
 
05:18:08.430 --> 05:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
analyze the
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
data being an
 
05:18:13.548 --> 05:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
engineer you know I have to have some
 
05:18:15.868 --> 05:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
bounds is what I have to I could I would
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
have to analyze you have any idea what
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.840 --> 05:18:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
here is he
 
05:18:33.040 --> 05:18:36.628 align:start position:0%
here is he
here

05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.788 --> 05:18:39.798 align:start position:0%
believe yourself okay I'm
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
sorry it it it appears that they're
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
asking the individual agencies to do an
 
05:18:47.868 --> 05:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
analytical process and then provide that
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
state that uh that data to uh where it
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
will be centralized but that would
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
require as far as we can see that each
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
agency would have to do the analysis of
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
of each of those categories by
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
demographics which uh some agencies can
 
05:19:10.030 --> 05:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
do part of that uh I'm not sure that any
 
05:19:12.548 --> 05:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
can do all of it but my information from
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs that that I've talked to in
 
05:19:18.990 --> 05:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
preparation for this testimony is that
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh many can do a little bit of it but
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's no one we've been able to
 
05:19:26.430 --> 05:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
discover can do all of the an analysis
 
05:19:28.030 --> 05:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
that seems to be
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
required thank
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:32.270 align:start position:0%
required thank
you

05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:19:32.280 --> 05:19:33.628 align:start position:0%
you
representative

05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
n thank you chairman and thank you for
 
05:19:40.190 --> 05:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so as I understand
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
it um we currently don't gather this
 
05:19:48.750 --> 05:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
resources uh
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
no uh uh the it's really a question of
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
accuracy um when you get to demographics
 
05:20:01.548 --> 05:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
and I think some of the others uh
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions have been about how you gather
 
05:20:04.200 --> 05:20:04.868 align:start position:0%
questions have been about how you gather
the

05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:10.350 --> 05:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
data specifically regarding a race um
 
05:20:14.548 --> 05:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
clearly it it's very offensive to uh
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
folks for officers to ask for that
 
05:20:22.150 --> 05:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
information and for them for an officer
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
to uh record their perception of the
 
05:20:29.110 --> 05:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
race uh is fraught with danger because
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
uh as has been pointed out
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
we have so so many folks that are of of
 
05:20:38.548 --> 05:20:38.558 align:start position:0%
mixed race and in the era can be high
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore uh the resulting analysis
 
05:20:47.708 --> 05:20:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
incorrect representative night you
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
recognize for a followup
 
05:20:55.270 --> 05:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
so you don't see a problem not being
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
able to tell us how many
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
let's say people of color you pull over
 
05:21:06.430 --> 05:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
versus white people for the same
 
05:21:06.440 --> 05:21:09.270 align:start position:0%
versus white people for the same
offense

05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
offense
 
05:21:12.910 --> 05:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
oh I think I think it's pretty clear uh
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
from the police perspective that we have
 
05:21:17.590 --> 05:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
no question whatsoever with providing
 
05:21:20.750 --> 05:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
that data the question is how do we
 
05:21:23.788 --> 05:21:23.798 align:start position:0%
obtain it in an accurate way uh it
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
should be obtained but the fact is right
 
05:21:29.230 --> 05:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
now there's no way for police officers
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
to accurately obtain
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
that data as I pointed out the
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
officer as a practical matter is not
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask for it and secondarily uh
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
his or her perception may be incorrect
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
which in the end result uh gives you an
 
05:21:50.160 --> 05:21:52.510 align:start position:0%
which in the end result uh gives you an
incorrect

05:21:52.510 --> 05:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
05:21:55.948 --> 05:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
conclusion so be clear there's no
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
objection to collecting and documenting
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
the data why officers why people will
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
stop uh what happens as a result of
 
05:22:07.628 --> 05:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
those stops no question at all that
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's important information the
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
question is is there there's no uh
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
presently there's no way to accurately
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.990 --> 05:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
data and the suggestion of course is
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
that it be on the driver's license or
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
some identification therefore the person
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.718 --> 05:22:37.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:22:37.150 --> 05:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:41.788 --> 05:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
M so if if if the only way is to get
 
05:22:41.798 --> 05:22:42.590 align:start position:0%
M so if if if the only way is to get
this

05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
information uh from something like a
 
05:22:47.470 --> 05:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license one of the issues I
 
05:22:49.230 --> 05:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
think we all run into is our driver's
 
05:22:53.910 --> 05:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
licenses are renewed every four years um
 
05:22:55.708 --> 05:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
so if you if you take a look at the
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
Timeline you know for something like
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
that uh we could conceivably be in a
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
situation where might take as long as
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
four years uh before everybody uh has
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
these fields on their license uh meaning
 
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
that the amount of usable analyzable
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
data that we have may not reach a
 
05:23:17.070 --> 05:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
critical mass for another four years do
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs think that that is acceptable
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
given the current racial climate in the
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
country and the state well it would be a
 
05:23:25.948 --> 05:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
trade-off between either waiting to get
 
05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
accurate information or rely on on
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
represent you recognized for a follow
 
05:23:38.840 --> 05:23:42.030 align:start position:0%
represent you recognized for a follow
question

05:23:42.030 --> 05:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
um I'll save it for the executive
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
chair representative kman represent do
 
05:23:53.910 --> 05:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
you want you have your hand
 
05:23:57.628 --> 05:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
rais s you both W I was trying to figure
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
out how to word this as a
 
05:23:59.798 --> 05:24:03.390 align:start position:0%
out how to word this as a
question

05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:05.230 --> 05:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
me a while to catch
 
05:24:07.470 --> 05:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
on um
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay several
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
states do collect demographic
 
05:24:14.520 --> 05:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
states do collect demographic
data

05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question would because in
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
my my my
 
05:24:22.200 --> 05:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
my my my
opinion

05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:24:28.670 --> 05:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
um would you
 
05:24:32.590 --> 05:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
um representing um the chief of police
 
05:24:35.910 --> 05:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we looking at
 
05:24:43.708 --> 05:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
data that other um states are using or
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
how they're using or how they're
 
05:24:49.548 --> 05:24:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:52.590 --> 05:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
information or I guess a better question
 
05:24:57.868 --> 05:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
that do we look at other states or is
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
was that the
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
question um I I can uh maybe address
 
05:25:08.910 --> 05:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
that a little bit from a personal
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
perspective one of the projects I uh
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
worked on for up until a couple of years
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
ago for umh seven years involved exactly
 
05:25:23.868 --> 05:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
this a collection of of uh stop
 
05:25:28.510 --> 05:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
data and uh one of my um jobs was to
 
05:25:31.548 --> 05:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
analyze stop data and
 
05:25:33.470 --> 05:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the database that we looked at were
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
involved about uh somewhere
 
05:25:37.080 --> 05:25:39.310 align:start position:0%
involved about uh somewhere
between

05:25:39.310 --> 05:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
um somewhere around 10 to
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
14,000 uh data sets and uh we looked at
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
we looked at this data uh on a monthly
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
basis and uh uh while it was very
 
05:26:01.548 --> 05:26:01.558 align:start position:0%
valuable wasn't based upon uh any
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
self-identification there was there was
 
05:26:06.270 --> 05:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
always an area that was suspect and
 
05:26:09.708 --> 05:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the volume was so
 
05:26:13.470 --> 05:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
high uh it didn't uh the volume was so
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
high with particularly with
 
05:26:19.628 --> 05:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
African-Americans that uh even if it was
 
05:26:22.110 --> 05:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
not entirely accurate it gave us a
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
pretty good picture but when you when
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
you get to New Hampshire the database
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be as large as that uh on
 
05:26:31.230 --> 05:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
or even on an annual basis so I think
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little more important that the
 
05:26:39.310 --> 05:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
data be be as accurate as we can make it
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and and you know I just want to make
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
sure you everyone understands that the
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police Chiefs do not
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
oppose the collection of demographics
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's a question of how do we get from
 
05:26:54.030 --> 05:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
the idea of collecting the demographics
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
to making sure they're as accurate as we
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
can possibly make them and if if we have
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
to have an interim process until we can
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh assure that that data is uh included
 
05:27:09.750 --> 05:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
on driver's license or other
 
05:27:12.030 --> 05:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
identification then maybe that's
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be worked out
 
05:27:17.470 --> 05:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
but uh ultimately ultimately I think
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
everyone would like to have that data be
 
05:27:22.750 --> 05:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
accurate because we're making uh
 
05:27:25.788 --> 05:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
assumptions on the basis of that data
 
05:27:28.830 --> 05:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
and uh those assumptions are going to uh
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
predict actions that may may not be
 
05:27:34.590 --> 05:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
taken uh we should do that on the basis
 
05:27:37.548 --> 05:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
of uh data that's as accurate as it
 
05:27:40.510 --> 05:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
possibly can be so we're trying to get
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
to accurate
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
data uh in a way that's that's practical
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
and and I think we all need to work
 
05:27:52.190 --> 05:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
there seeing no further questions I want
 
05:27:57.628 --> 05:27:57.638 align:start position:0%
to thank the witness for his
 
05:28:04.510 --> 05:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.470 --> 05:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
de uh thank you Mr chairman uh for the
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
record my name is James demur and one of
 
05:28:11.390 --> 05:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
the clients I represent is the New
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police Association um I just
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to make you aware just for
 
05:28:19.390 --> 05:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
informational purposes that uh Senate
 
05:28:19.400 --> 05:28:20.788 align:start position:0%
informational purposes that uh Senate
Bill

05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
96 uh has had its Hearing in the Senate
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
that is a bill that was actually drafted
 
05:28:29.670 --> 05:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General's office to
 
05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
conform with many of the provisions that
 
05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
are in the leac report and the
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
demographic uh issues that you're
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
hearing discussed today are in that bill
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
and I think um if you are you know able
 
05:28:48.070 --> 05:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
to hold the bill you've got and wait for
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 96 to come over you'll see
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the issues sort of the
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
holes that people are raising that might
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
be in this bill today are addressed and
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a couple of examples so um
 
05:29:02.948 --> 05:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
that particular Bill actually does have
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
language that modifies the driver's
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
license um
 
05:29:12.190 --> 05:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
information in the state so that race
 
05:29:14.708 --> 05:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
and ethnicity can be collected on a
 
05:29:18.270 --> 05:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
driver's license which is not today uh
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's certainly going to make it much
 
05:29:22.750 --> 05:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
more easier and as Chief Reynolds said
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
more accurate um in gathering that
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
information uh one of the questions that
 
05:29:32.670 --> 05:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
came up is is there 28a issue uh if the
 
05:29:32.680 --> 05:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
came up is is there 28a issue uh if the
local

05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
communities are mandated to do the
 
05:29:40.270 --> 05:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
analysis of all this information that
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
particular bill in the Senate um
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually puts the responsibility on the
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council to
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
gather the information analyze it and
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
actually post it on their website so
 
05:29:56.430 --> 05:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
that it's available uh for the public so
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
that particular bill which is the actual
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
Lea um
 
05:30:03.510 --> 05:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is making its way through
 
05:30:05.868 --> 05:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
the Senate I have pretty strong
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
confidence that it's going to pass the
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
Senate so I think you're going to have a
 
05:30:12.030 --> 05:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill coming to you that's going to
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
address a lot of the questions that have
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
been raised today and it might be best
 
05:30:22.548 --> 05:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%

introduce the bill because they may want
 
05:34:17.708 --> 05:34:17.718 align:start position:0%

those who they judge to be from another
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
country or have brown or black skin I am
 
05:36:23.548 --> 05:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
a very visible Muslim woman who wears
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
hijab um and is indeed an immigrant but
 
05:36:29.868 --> 05:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
I have citizenship um the only only
 
05:36:32.948 --> 05:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
reason I was able uh that I am able to
 
05:36:35.788 --> 05:36:35.798 align:start position:0%
be here today is because of a flimsy
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
document that is the deciding factor of
 
05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
whether violence would have been enacted
 
05:36:43.868 --> 05:36:43.878 align:start position:0%
on me that day a violence that would
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
have physically removed me from my
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
children and family um as I drove up we
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
were met with uh what looked like
 
05:36:54.868 --> 05:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
heavily armed military uh but they were
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
border patrol they stopped our car and
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
asked if I was a citizen I refused to
 
05:37:03.788 --> 05:37:03.798 align:start position:0%
answer such an invasive question and
 
05:37:05.868 --> 05:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
they pulled our car to the side and we
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
were detained What followed was a
 
05:37:10.830 --> 05:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
barrage of questions demanding I share
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
my immigration status upon hearing how
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
well I spoke English one of the men with
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
a gun clearly visible to his hip told me
 
05:37:22.030 --> 05:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
and my friend that he thought I'm most
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
likely a citizen because he didn't pick
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
up an accent a foreign accent I asked
 
05:37:29.948 --> 05:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
him if this is how he determined who was
 
05:37:33.070 --> 05:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
a citizen and who wasn't and his answer
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
was it's a very good
 
05:37:38.190 --> 05:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
indicator while trying to find my
 
05:37:40.868 --> 05:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
immigration status they threatened me
 
05:37:42.510 --> 05:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
and they that that they would call the
 
05:37:44.548 --> 05:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
police to make sure that I had
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
documentation that I just did not have
 
05:37:49.030 --> 05:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
on me at the time after their
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
investigation they did let me go since
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is since this incident there have
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
been many other checkpoints in the state
 
05:37:58.470 --> 05:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire including right near
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
where I live in leban
 
05:38:02.670 --> 05:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
where they boarded buses and asking
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
people of color for proof of their
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship my friend who was a black
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
Citizen was also flagged to be stopped
 
05:38:12.030 --> 05:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
and asked for citizenship in that
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
checkpoint unlike me other people were
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
separated from their families including
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
a father and another brother to a
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
citizen that had been here for many
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
years doing nothing wrong and working
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard and contributing to our
 
05:38:28.590 --> 05:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
community if you cannot find it in your
 
05:38:31.390 --> 05:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
hearts to simp sympathize with families
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
with children who are no longer able to
 
05:38:35.948 --> 05:38:35.958 align:start position:0%
see their family members then I urge you
 
05:38:38.590 --> 05:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
to consider another impact how this is
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
hurting our state of New Hampshire
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
because many people have decided they
 
05:38:44.110 --> 05:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
will no longer visit the state because
 
05:38:46.468 --> 05:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
of these random checkpoints that cause
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
severe traffic congestion it's just the
 
05:38:51.468 --> 05:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
best interest of our state and our
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
communities to alert the local media
 
05:38:56.190 --> 05:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
when these very problematic and very
 
05:38:58.548 --> 05:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
discriminatory immigration checkpoints
 
05:39:02.310 --> 05:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
happen yes Ma I'm done now thank you
 
05:39:02.320 --> 05:39:03.990 align:start position:0%

you are there any questions by the
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee I do have a small
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
question the I just have one question uh
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
did you feel threatened by the police
 
05:39:16.948 --> 05:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
asking you your
 
05:39:21.310 --> 05:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
race uh you're talking about border
 
05:39:27.708 --> 05:39:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:32.030 --> 05:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman chman um thank
 
05:39:35.628 --> 05:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh I too support
 
05:39:35.638 --> 05:39:36.750 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh I too support
this

05:39:36.750 --> 05:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:39:41.350 --> 05:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
of you know white people be involved in
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
this too so it's not just one you know
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
one side um that's why I support this
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill but the question I have is what did
 
05:39:55.708 --> 05:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
this happen in lonia area where they've
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
been checking you know putting these
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
checkpoint Charlies up as I call them or
 
05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
was it down in the Lebanon
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
area yeah the two incidences that I just
 
05:40:09.310 --> 05:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
described the first one um happened uh
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
on the highway in New Hampshire um I
 
05:40:14.670 --> 05:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
forgot if what highway that was I can I
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
mean it's in the article that I sent you
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
but the second one happened in Lebanon
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
so they happen in different
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:28.320 --> 05:40:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:40:32.190 --> 05:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair can you hear
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
me yeah and I'm not sure whether my
 
05:40:37.948 --> 05:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
video is on I can't find the button um
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
it is okay thank you and uh I just am I
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
correct in UN in my understanding that
 
05:40:50.190 --> 05:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
states that are are um further away than
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
75 miles from a border uh don't have
 
05:40:53.520 --> 05:40:56.030 align:start position:0%
75 miles from a border uh don't have
this

05:40:56.030 --> 05:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:58.390 --> 05:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
problem yeah if you're asking me I
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe it have states have it has to be
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
100 miles from the border and the other
 
05:41:04.670 --> 05:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
checkpoint is in Woodstock by the way
 
05:41:06.150 --> 05:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
sorry the first checkpoint but they have
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
to be 100 miles from a border and this
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
was many many miles away um but still
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
within the 100 mile but um basically uh
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
most of the United States has a border
 
05:41:20.750 --> 05:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's within the 100 mile radius
 
05:41:23.310 --> 05:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
so again that means many people can get
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
caught up in these checkpoints the
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire
 
05:41:30.788 --> 05:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
basically thank you
 
05:41:37.310 --> 05:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.638 --> 05:41:48.948 align:start position:0%
 
hand

05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
David representa Green thank you Mr
 
05:41:55.548 --> 05:41:55.558 align:start position:0%
chair uh my question is have you been to
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
any other state or country that's had
 
05:41:58.160 --> 05:42:00.590 align:start position:0%
any other state or country that's had
checkpoints

05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
checkpoints
 
05:42:05.390 --> 05:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
yes I have um I am from Libya and we

have uh checkpoints as well and I don't
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
consider Libya a um free country so uh
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to compare ourselves
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
with um what some people may call third
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
world countries uh
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%

05:44:07.548 --> 05:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
checkpoint that occurred during Father's
 
05:44:09.750 --> 05:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
Day weekend so I just wanted to send
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
that to you so you can kind of see what
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
those types of communications just look
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
like in real time between uh federal
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
agencies and the state police and and
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
lastly I also included in my written
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um a proposed amendment um so
 
05:44:28.150 --> 05:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
I obviously support using the notice
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
that exists for sobriety checkpoints as
 
05:44:33.510 --> 05:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
a model for the notice that we think
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
should exist for federal immigration
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
checkpoints but because there aren't
 
05:44:40.390 --> 05:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
clearcut rules in New Hampshire as to
 
05:44:42.910 --> 05:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
how advanced in term of days that notice
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
should be I proposed an amendment in my
 
05:44:46.868 --> 05:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I I think is kind
 
05:44:48.628 --> 05:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
of a simple fix to this and frankly
 
05:44:50.868 --> 05:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
makes the bill easier to comply with and
 
05:44:52.750 --> 05:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
Implement for state agencies once they
 
05:44:55.150 --> 05:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
become aware of a checkpoint so this
 
05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill and why we support it you know it's
 
05:44:59.708 --> 05:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
it's about checkpoints and the concerns
 
05:45:01.468 --> 05:45:01.478 align:start position:0%
we have with them though immigration
 
05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
obviously is the context in which this
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
has arisen and the context that this
 
05:45:07.910 --> 05:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill deals with and the problem with
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
checkpoints in our view more broadly is
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
that the government stopping individuals
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
without any indication that a crime has
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
been committed that's the same concern
 
05:45:18.670 --> 05:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
with sobriety checkpoints for that
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
matter uh now we obviously as a state
 
05:45:22.830 --> 05:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
can't tell the government the federal
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
government what to do but what we can do
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
is require notice um by state agencies
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
to the public once they become aware of
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
that yeah you went past your time Li oh
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
gosh I'm so sorry well I'm happy to take
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
any questions as well my
 
05:45:43.628 --> 05:45:43.638 align:start position:0%
apologies are there any questions by the
 
05:45:46.590 --> 05:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.350 --> 05:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
I I had the same issue with sobriety
 
05:46:01.110 --> 05:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
checkpoint Point not thinking that
 
05:46:03.910 --> 05:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who gets caught in one had even
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
noticed that there was one going to be
 
05:46:08.948 --> 05:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
held I guess I'm everybody seems to be
 
05:46:11.910 --> 05:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
so upset about a
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:19.150 --> 05:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
know what kind of impact is publishing
 
05:46:22.670 --> 05:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
notice going to have on on a
 
05:46:25.868 --> 05:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
immigration uh checkpoint I mean are
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
people going to drive around it you know
 
05:46:31.948 --> 05:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
I just hear the use of it yeah I thank
 
05:46:33.628 --> 05:46:33.638 align:start position:0%
you for that question and and I think
 
05:46:36.350 --> 05:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's a good one and I think why notice
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
is important is for the same reason it's
 
05:46:39.750 --> 05:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
become important in the context of
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
sobriety checkpoints it's just a m it's
 
05:46:43.750 --> 05:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
just something that mitigates the
 
05:46:47.230 --> 05:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
intrusion and you know uh for folks who
 
05:46:49.350 --> 05:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
be who are aware of it through notice it
 
05:46:52.190 --> 05:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
gives them an opportunity to avoid that
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
intrusion which in this case is
 
05:46:55.948 --> 05:46:55.958 align:start position:0%
obviously coming in the form of a
 
05:46:58.830 --> 05:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
suspicionless stop and so I I really
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
think it's important really for the same
 
05:47:02.990 --> 05:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
ways that it's become important in the
 
05:47:05.150 --> 05:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
context of sobriety checkpoints it's
 
05:47:06.990 --> 05:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
just a mitigating Factor because the
 
05:47:10.350 --> 05:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
norm under the fourth amendment is you
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
know you're not allowed to uh engage in
 
05:47:15.430 --> 05:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
suspicionless stops we permit them here
 
05:47:17.628 --> 05:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
in this Li limited instance but to I
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
important yes thank you Mr chair
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
testimony do you know how many stops
 
05:47:41.230 --> 05:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
they do a year in New Hampshire and will
 
05:47:44.590 --> 05:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
this bill address the fish and game
 
05:47:46.750 --> 05:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
issue that they have a fish and game
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
officer come so they can do a search
 
05:47:51.708 --> 05:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
warrant of a car without a warrant or a
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
search of a car without a
 
05:47:57.948 --> 05:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
warrant that that's a great question and
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
so uh the first answer to your question
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
concerns the
 
05:48:03.750 --> 05:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
frequency uh with which these have
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
occurred there have
 
05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
been I'm aware of at least 10 of these
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
temporary checkpoints that have occurred
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the past four or five years uh
 
05:48:16.990 --> 05:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's also one or two that I know
 
05:48:20.310 --> 05:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
occurred uh during the 2012 time frame
 
05:48:22.868 --> 05:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
so you know there's been an uptick um of
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
these recently
 
05:48:27.990 --> 05:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
um it would not address that fishing
 
05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
game issue really this bill is just
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
about about notice um the one of the
 
05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
issues that you're dealing with we've
 
05:48:38.070 --> 05:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
litigated the ACLU separately which has
 
05:48:41.310 --> 05:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
to do with can Federal immigration
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
agents use these stops to essentially
 
05:48:47.708 --> 05:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
engage in drug enforcement and then hand
 
05:48:49.468 --> 05:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
those individuals over the state to
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
state authorities for
 
05:48:53.468 --> 05:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh for State crimes and in
 
05:48:56.190 --> 05:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
in one case that we litigated a state
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
court judge ruled that that actually
 
05:49:00.628 --> 05:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
violated the New Hampshire Constitution
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
because the use of dogs was
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
impermissible because to use dogs you
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
actually need Reasonable Suspicion and
 
05:49:08.310 --> 05:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
obviously none none of that is occurring
 
05:49:11.070 --> 05:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
here dogs are being run along these cars
 
05:49:12.788 --> 05:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
without any indication of criminal
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
activity so the problem that you're
 
05:49:17.070 --> 05:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
raising representative berd is actually
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
kind of being addressed or was addressed
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
I would argue in separate
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:28.830 --> 05:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:49:33.948 --> 05:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
question um do you know what the process
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
is when a federal
 
05:49:39.310 --> 05:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
agency is planning on uh conducting a
 
05:49:41.708 --> 05:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
checkpoint in New Hampshire do they
 
05:49:44.350 --> 05:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
contact the State Police the local
 
05:49:46.910 --> 05:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
police the County police but who gets
 
05:49:49.510 --> 05:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
contacted or do they have to contact
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
anybody it's a great question I mean
 
05:49:53.548 --> 05:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
they probably don't have to contact
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
anyone but they do um because uh they're
 
05:50:00.270 --> 05:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
engag ing in these stops on freeways
 
05:50:02.830 --> 05:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
obviously the state troopers you know
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
monitor freeways uh on the part of the
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
state and so what we've noticed through
 
05:50:10.190 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
some public records requests is that
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
when these checkpoints are set up it is
 
05:50:16.788 --> 05:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
a very routine practice for the federal
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
agencies to notify the State Police in
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
advance and in recognition of that
 
05:50:22.990 --> 05:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
practice we think it's only fair then at
 
05:50:25.350 --> 05:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
that point for the state agency that
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
gets that notice than to just tell the
 
05:50:29.468 --> 05:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
public um that it's that's occurring so
 
05:50:31.830 --> 05:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
that that is why I wanted to attach to
 
05:50:35.788 --> 05:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
my testimony as exhibit to what that
 
05:50:37.948 --> 05:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
notice looks like that's a document we
 
05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
received in response to a public records
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.110 --> 05:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:06.430 --> 05:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:51:08.788 --> 05:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question could you
 
05:51:11.948 --> 05:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
just give a brief comparison of how DWI
 
05:51:14.510 --> 05:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
sites are run and how these uh
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
immigration sites might be run for
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
instance I think in DWI they do like
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
every 10th car or something like that
 
05:51:22.468 --> 05:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
are they similar or are they different
 
05:51:25.270 --> 05:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I you know I I'm not sure how it's
 
05:51:27.468 --> 05:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
done with respect to the the number of
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
cars that are stopped but I can tell you
 
05:51:31.670 --> 05:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
U when you look at exhibit one which is
 
05:51:35.230 --> 05:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
the AG's manual on sobriety checkpoints
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
you have to submit a plan as to how
 
05:51:39.868 --> 05:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to conduct the checkpoint
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
and probably address that very issue
 
05:51:43.788 --> 05:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
representative new that you flagged the
 
05:51:45.468 --> 05:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
frequency with which with which you're
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to stop um automobiles you need to
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
let the Attorney General's office know
 
05:51:52.948 --> 05:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
um and you also need to get I believe
 
05:51:55.868 --> 05:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
court approval in advance and part of
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
that plan to conduct the checkpoint
 
05:52:01.390 --> 05:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
includes a plan for advanced notice
 
05:52:03.310 --> 05:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
which is why I think there's some appeal
 
05:52:06.990 --> 05:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
here of having some advanced notice with
 
05:52:08.910 --> 05:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
respect to immigration checkpoints I
 
05:52:11.230 --> 05:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
mean it is a somewhat different context
 
05:52:14.510 --> 05:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
here but I think that's the idea behind
 
05:52:18.750 --> 05:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
trying to create similar notice here uh
 
05:52:21.948 --> 05:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
than that exists in sobriety
 
05:52:25.150 --> 05:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
checkpoints representative Knight thank
 
05:52:27.468 --> 05:52:27.478 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:52:27.478 --> 05:52:28.788 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you for taking my
question

05:52:28.788 --> 05:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:52:32.190 --> 05:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
um when you do the DWI checkpoints do
 
05:52:36.350 --> 05:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:39.990 --> 05:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
information um great question I actually
 
05:52:43.150 --> 05:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
don't know um the specific questions
 
05:52:45.548 --> 05:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
that uh are asked uh I could look at the
 
05:52:47.310 --> 05:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
AG memo and maybe that would provide
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
guidance but you're not going to get
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
asked for example like your citizenship
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's not gered I would
 
05:52:56.830 --> 05:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
think to the sobriety analysis whereas
 
05:52:59.230 --> 05:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
that is a question obviously asked as
 
05:53:01.620 --> 05:53:01.630 align:start position:0%
part of these immigration
 
05:53:01.630 --> 05:53:07.350 align:start position:0%
part of these immigration

now yes represent yes representative
 
05:54:08.030 --> 05:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
Perez okay thank you thank you for the
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
um as an immigrant and a personal
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
colored I support this bill because it
 
05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
is hard for people no matter no matter
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
where you're from no matter yes it
 
05:54:24.750 --> 05:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
happens to people with uh with a a
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
lighter color but it happens more for
 
05:54:28.590 --> 05:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
people like
 
05:54:32.430 --> 05:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
me and it's and it's difficult to to
 
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
explain how how it is to everywhere you
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
go if you think you're GNA get close to
 
05:54:39.868 --> 05:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
the 100 miles and sometimes it's
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
difficult to remind yourself exactly
 
05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
where you hun 100 miles are and then
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
carrying you US citizenship everywhere
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
you go because I wasn't born here yes I
 
05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
am a US citizen now but I you know it's
 
05:54:56.590 --> 05:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to be carrying you US
 
05:54:59.070 --> 05:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship everywhere you go and if you
 
05:55:01.670 --> 05:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
lose that citizenship you have to pay to
 
05:55:04.350 --> 05:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
get a new one and sometime you have to
 
05:55:07.390 --> 05:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
wait a year to three years to get a new
 
05:55:10.350 --> 05:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
one so that's one of the reason that I'm
 
05:55:12.990 --> 05:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill because we need to
 
05:55:15.070 --> 05:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that people
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
realize yes um it is important to have
 
05:55:20.430 --> 05:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
the checkpoints but at the same time it
 
05:55:23.628 --> 05:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
is important for uh people not be
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
discriminated because they're colored or
 
05:55:27.230 --> 05:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
because of the accident or anything like
 
05:55:29.670 --> 05:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
that and then don't feel like
 
05:55:32.830 --> 05:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
um scared to to go and visit these
 
05:55:34.708 --> 05:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
beautiful places in new hire and be
 
05:55:37.788 --> 05:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
scared that you're going to be um
 
05:55:39.510 --> 05:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
stopping in one of these checkpoints and
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have your citizenship and you
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
can go to jail and sometime it takes
 
05:55:45.910 --> 05:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
days or maybe couple of weeks before you
 
05:55:48.230 --> 05:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
can get out of jail even though you are
 
05:55:48.240 --> 05:55:53.948 align:start position:0%
can get out of jail even though you are
US

05:55:53.948 --> 05:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
citizen and thank you that that that was
 
05:56:00.468 --> 05:56:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you representative for your
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and the chair just will have a
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
question so and I'll just preface this
 
05:56:10.468 --> 05:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
by by saying my father immigrated to
 
05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
this country and was uh came in American
 
05:56:16.948 --> 05:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
citizen and I don't recall him ever in
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
his entire life since passed away but he
 
05:56:22.350 --> 05:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
ever carried his any paper for with him
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
showing that he was United States
 
05:56:26.670 --> 05:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
citizen so is that the concern that you
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
have that you you don't there's no no
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
reason for you to car I wouldn't see one
 
05:56:32.788 --> 05:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
is that the concern you have with the
 
05:56:32.798 --> 05:56:33.628 align:start position:0%
is that the concern you have with the
these

05:56:33.628 --> 05:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:56:35.708 --> 05:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
checkpoints well the the problem with
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
the checkpoints now is like before it it
 
05:56:42.590 --> 05:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
does it didn't used to be this way that
 
05:56:45.910 --> 05:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
people be so scared about being put on
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
yell because you you don't have you you
 
05:56:50.548 --> 05:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
know your passport or you your USA
 
05:56:53.708 --> 05:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
citizenship but now they it it is
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
difficult because a lot of police
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
department they take you know they now
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
they they uh they feel like they have
 
05:57:03.590 --> 05:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
the immigration uh right and then if you
 
05:57:06.590 --> 05:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a legal right they can uh
 
05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
send you to the immigration department
 
05:57:11.230 --> 05:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
and sometimes if you don't have any of
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
these documentations to prove that um
 
05:57:15.670 --> 05:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
you are you a citizen even though you
 
05:57:18.030 --> 05:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
are you can be put in yell and then you
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
have to pay a lawyer until you know all
 
05:57:22.670 --> 05:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
these clears and and they they figure it
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
out you that in reality you are US
 
05:57:26.798 --> 05:57:30.110 align:start position:0%
out you that in reality you are US
citizen

05:57:30.110 --> 05:57:30.120 align:start position:0%

a member of the community and I'm here
 
05:58:05.190 --> 05:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
to express my support for this bill uh
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the few immigrants uh we went
 
05:58:09.590 --> 05:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
viral with this video uh that was
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
recorded with our interaction with CBP
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
in wock in Hampshire I moved to New
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um because of the Liberties
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
that I promoted because it for me is
 
05:58:22.830 --> 05:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
truly is a really H secluded area but
 
05:58:26.110 --> 05:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
most most more even so A beautiful state
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
especially when you head up nor to the
 
05:58:29.230 --> 05:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
White Mountains which is where I live
 
05:58:31.788 --> 05:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
and work uh it's a great place to raise
 
05:58:34.190 --> 05:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
my family and it's free of those dangers
 
05:58:37.468 --> 05:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
of the uh the big city I live in Thorton
 
05:58:38.830 --> 05:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
which is the next town right after
 
05:58:41.230 --> 05:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
Woodstock of 993 which is where all
 
05:58:42.830 --> 05:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
these checkpoints happen most of the
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
time I experienced firsthand the
 
05:58:47.468 --> 05:58:47.478 align:start position:0%
treatment and professional conduct from
 
05:58:50.590 --> 05:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
my custom water Patrol they detain me
 
05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
three times already with no valid reason
 
05:58:56.230 --> 05:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
when I'm headed to work you know my my
 
05:58:58.150 --> 05:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
children are often scared for safety
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
because they don't know what's going to
 
05:59:01.430 --> 05:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
happen even though I'm here I'm a US
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
citizen um I also work in the
 
05:59:06.510 --> 05:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry and I do understand
 
05:59:08.390 --> 05:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
the discomfort for many Travelers coming
 
05:59:10.510 --> 05:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
to the White Mountains in many in
 
05:59:12.270 --> 05:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
instances I have friends calling me or
 
05:59:14.350 --> 05:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
family members calling me ahead of time
 
05:59:15.830 --> 05:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
to find out if these bordered patrol
 
05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
checkpoints are going to happen in the
 
05:59:19.150 --> 05:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
highway mind you not because they have
 
05:59:21.150 --> 05:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
any issue with their status they're all
 
05:59:24.468 --> 05:59:24.478 align:start position:0%
US citizens they just don't want to deal
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
they just don't want the families and
 
05:59:27.628 --> 05:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
children to experience the level of
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
harassments from law enforce law
 
05:59:31.948 --> 05:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement especially in our state they
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
just don't want to deal with it I do
 
05:59:35.788 --> 05:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
understand that CBP is following
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
directions I do get the pack that all
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
our borders need to be secure uh but the
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
fact that there's a lot of residents in
 
05:59:44.590 --> 05:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do not know that CBP has
 
05:59:46.510 --> 05:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
this 100 mile Authority from any water
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
line that's all of New Hampshire that's
 
05:59:52.910 --> 05:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
about 80% of ver off they can come and
 
05:59:54.750 --> 05:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
go literally with no
 
05:59:56.830 --> 05:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
repercussion uh they can harass innocent
 
05:59:56.840 --> 05:59:58.110 align:start position:0%
repercussion uh they can harass innocent
drivers

05:59:58.110 --> 05:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's no excuse they only ask your
 
06:00:03.750 --> 06:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
ciip citizenship uh they often they
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
judge the drivers by the accient if
 
06:00:07.990 --> 06:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're a foreigner you have to expect
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to be detained for at least
 
06:00:09.120 --> 06:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
you're going to be detained for at least
an

06:00:11.430 --> 06:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:13.708 --> 06:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
hour they can assume that we're risky
 
06:00:15.750 --> 06:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
citizens because of our skin color and
 
06:00:17.070 --> 06:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes like my friend Asma because
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
you're wearing a hijab you know I also
 
06:00:20.910 --> 06:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
on my on my last time that I got

06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
question yes I do uh chairman Mr
 
06:01:22.350 --> 06:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank
 
06:01:22.360 --> 06:01:24.030 align:start position:0%
chairman thank
you

06:01:24.030 --> 06:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
um s your experience the uh they said
 
06:01:31.628 --> 06:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
You' been stopped three times in in one
 
06:01:33.830 --> 06:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
of these checkpoints is it your opinion
 
06:01:35.990 --> 06:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they were you were randomly stopped
 
06:01:37.350 --> 06:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
or that there was some other reason they
 
06:01:39.548 --> 06:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
might have stopped
 
06:01:41.788 --> 06:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
you it can be a combination of
 
06:01:44.708 --> 06:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
everything you know uh um they they they
 
06:01:47.628 --> 06:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
pull me over pull me over to the side uh
 
06:01:49.830 --> 06:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for me to check my my
 
06:01:51.868 --> 06:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
status to check who I am I think to
 
06:01:54.030 --> 06:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
check my license plate uh to see you
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
know my C registration to see who I am
 
06:01:58.150 --> 06:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then after that they let me go uh
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
but yeah that's that's pretty much what
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
they do um I I I don't know if it's the
 
06:02:04.468 --> 06:02:04.478 align:start position:0%
skin color I don't know if it's my
 
06:02:07.310 --> 06:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
accent which is pretty clear uh you know
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know sir but it's uh I think
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
it's something that needs to stop and
 
06:02:13.390 --> 06:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
also you know like I said uh think it
 
06:02:16.510 --> 06:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
was asked to a seu member about um when
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
this happen it happened during holidays
 
06:02:20.510 --> 06:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it happened during
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day Weekend Labor Day weekend
 
06:02:25.310 --> 06:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
Fourth of July and also now the new
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
trend is that happens during by week in
 
06:02:26.920 --> 06:02:28.150 align:start position:0%
trend is that happens during by week in
lonia

06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
lonia
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh they know there's a lot of bikers
 
06:02:31.270 --> 06:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
coming in and out and it's going to stop
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
randing people and and stop them for you
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
know for carrying drugs with them which
 
06:02:38.830 --> 06:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's not cbp's uh
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:48.160 --> 06:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
represent yes uh thank you for your
 
06:02:55.230 --> 06:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you Mr chairman for
 
06:02:58.670 --> 06:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
having me let me ask this question
 
06:03:00.868 --> 06:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh so you said you've been through these
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
checkpoint Charlies three
 
06:03:04.080 --> 06:03:05.830 align:start position:0%
checkpoint Charlies three
times

06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:03:09.910 --> 06:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh did they tell you to pull you know
 
06:03:12.548 --> 06:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
because I've seen a many videos of these
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh did they tell you to go to like
 
06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
secondary or whatever they call that or
 
06:03:18.510 --> 06:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
did you just stay in line and they
 
06:03:21.390 --> 06:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
question you and then let you
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
go thank you for your question uh well
 
06:03:25.510 --> 06:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
when you go when you go I leave like I
 
06:03:27.310 --> 06:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
say I leave right next to the checkpoint
 
06:03:28.750 --> 06:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
literally off the highway I can see I
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
can see everything from there so that's
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
my way to go to work so when I drive
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
there um when that happens they usually
 
06:03:37.750 --> 06:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know you can tell they let people go
 
06:03:39.628 --> 06:03:39.638 align:start position:0%
and then randomly uh Vehicles get
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
stopped and they ask you where your CIP
 
06:03:44.070 --> 06:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
is if you say you know yes they let you
 
06:03:47.030 --> 06:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
go if you said no you go to a secondary
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
inspection um and sometimes that's the
 
06:03:52.430 --> 06:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
case and sometimes that's not the case
 
06:03:54.030 --> 06:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know what criteria they
 
06:03:56.070 --> 06:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
use to judge you know I'm not a border
 
06:03:57.628 --> 06:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
patrol agent I don't know how they're
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
being trained but um in some instances I
 
06:04:03.150 --> 06:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
think that there's an abuse of power
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
there or there's a uh they don't know
 
06:04:07.390 --> 06:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
who you are or sometimes like I say
 
06:04:09.230 --> 06:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
racial profiling might be coming into
 
06:04:12.430 --> 06:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
play I'm not I'm not sure about
 
06:04:19.868 --> 06:04:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr PES for your testimony
 
06:04:26.030 --> 06:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing No Hands raised the
 
06:04:27.788 --> 06:04:27.798 align:start position:0%

06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hannah Hello members of the committee uh
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe Hannon I'm speaking on
 
06:04:37.430 --> 06:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of
 
06:04:40.150 --> 06:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
myself um i' I'd like to just start with
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
saying uh I I appreciate the the chair's
 
06:04:45.788 --> 06:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
uh comments about his father being a
 
06:04:48.030 --> 06:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
legal US citizen and for years didn't
 
06:04:50.190 --> 06:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
have to carry his papers but I'd like to
 
06:04:52.830 --> 06:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
mention the fact that uh I am married to
 
06:04:55.070 --> 06:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
a a permanent legal resident my wife has
 
06:04:57.788 --> 06:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
been here for many many years
 
06:05:00.990 --> 06:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
and still uh does not have uh US
 
06:05:03.590 --> 06:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship but uh she has a permanent
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
resident status and she is required by
 
06:05:07.350 --> 06:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
law to carry her green card at all times
 
06:05:09.510 --> 06:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
under section 264e of the immigration
 
06:05:12.548 --> 06:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
and nationality act and failure to have
 
06:05:15.948 --> 06:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
that on oneself at any time uh can
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
result in a $100 fine and be put into
 
06:05:20.070 --> 06:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
put in jail for up to 30 days it's
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
unlikely to happen but it can happen and
 
06:05:26.468 --> 06:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
often does happen um and it's it's nice
 
06:05:28.430 --> 06:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
to have a heads up up sometimes she does
 
06:05:31.230 --> 06:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
carry her card at all times but uh you
 
06:05:32.628 --> 06:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
know if you know there's a checkpoint
 
06:05:33.868 --> 06:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to double check to make
 
06:05:35.190 --> 06:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
sure you have it on you because you
 
06:05:36.628 --> 06:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to be detained and have to be
 
06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
hassled uh she's a practicing emergency
 
06:05:40.788 --> 06:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
room position in this state she has
 
06:05:42.670 --> 06:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely no accent whatsoever because
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
she watched The Brady Bunch and listen
 
06:05:46.150 --> 06:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
to soap opers hours a day for years in
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
the early uh 80s to make sure she didn't
 
06:05:50.030 --> 06:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
have an accent she actually has less of
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
an accent than me and I don't want to
 
06:05:53.948 --> 06:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
make the mistake of saying AB boot or E
 
06:05:55.868 --> 06:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
and being confused as a Canadian either
 
06:05:57.948 --> 06:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
so I think having notice of these
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
checkpoints is is very appropriate and
 
06:06:01.788 --> 06:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to prevent a lot of
 
06:06:05.190 --> 06:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.670 --> 06:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.150 --> 06:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
no thank you Dr Hannah for Testimony
 
06:06:18.430 --> 06:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
I'll just thank you in advance for
 
06:06:21.030 --> 06:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question if you can clarify
 
06:06:23.510 --> 06:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that if someone had a a green
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
card that they were required to carry
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
that I lought but if someone has be uh
 
06:06:29.468 --> 06:06:29.478 align:start position:0%
who's immigrated this country has become
 
06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
a United States citizen are you aware
 
06:06:33.510 --> 06:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
are they required to carry any paperwork
 
06:06:35.948 --> 06:06:35.958 align:start position:0%
or documentation with them no once once
 
06:06:37.510 --> 06:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're a citizen you don't need to carry
 
06:06:39.788 --> 06:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
anything um you know I I remember I was
 
06:06:41.350 --> 06:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually traveling internationally once
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
with my uh soon to be mother-in-law and
 
06:06:46.990 --> 06:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
my I now wife and my mother-in-law just
 
06:06:51.070 --> 06:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
got her US citizenship uh she was heavy
 
06:06:53.548 --> 06:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
heavy accent from the Middle East and
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
she was you know I'm an American citizen
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
and my wife is no accent whatsoever she
 
06:07:00.468 --> 06:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
had to produce her Green Card all the

other papers and well side of Side Story
 
06:07:04.628 --> 06:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
I was the one that got searched but
 
06:07:06.750 --> 06:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
anyway the point is you don't have to
 
06:07:08.430 --> 06:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
carry it uh but if you are a legal
 
06:07:10.150 --> 06:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
resident alien like my wife and many
 
06:07:12.070 --> 06:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
other people in this country uh who are
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
allowed to be here permanently they have
 
06:07:16.708 --> 06:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
to carry this at all
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%

this is a bill that I brought um on on
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of a constituent Diane Richardson
 
06:28:34.150 --> 06:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
of Springfield um she is the true expert
 
06:28:36.788 --> 06:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
on this and with all due respect I
 
06:28:39.868 --> 06:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
recommend that she U be called next um
 
06:28:47.948 --> 06:28:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%

06:28:52.830 --> 06:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
06:28:57.830 --> 06:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh I am a huge dog
 
06:29:01.310 --> 06:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
lover so the bill has caught my interest
 
06:29:05.230 --> 06:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh the issue I'm having is the class B
 
06:29:08.110 --> 06:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
felony um can you explain how that
 
06:29:10.708 --> 06:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
became about and do other states have
 
06:29:13.868 --> 06:29:13.878 align:start position:0%
the same as it's a class B felony or is
 
06:29:18.590 --> 06:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
it a lower punishment for you know what
 
06:29:21.430 --> 06:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is you know the intent of the
 
06:29:25.548 --> 06:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you the question um the um I
 
06:29:27.868 --> 06:29:27.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not really aware um of how this is
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
handled in other states um um Mrs
 
06:29:33.628 --> 06:29:33.638 align:start position:0%
Richardson might have a better idea um
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
but um I will say that um just the
 
06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
collars alone are in some instances
 
06:29:43.230 --> 06:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
worth um ,000 dollar and up um a
 
06:29:47.230 --> 06:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
well-trained um uh tracking animal um
 
06:29:49.910 --> 06:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
could be worth thousands of dollars um
 
06:29:51.390 --> 06:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if you're suggesting
 
06:29:53.910 --> 06:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
that uh it ought to be a class a felony
 
06:29:57.788 --> 06:29:57.798 align:start position:0%
in some uh in instances but um values of
 
06:30:02.430 --> 06:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
over $1,000 would qualify as class a um
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
the problem we ran into last year was
 
06:30:09.190 --> 06:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
determining the um the value of a dog um
 
06:30:12.510 --> 06:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
my mut from um Arizona Arkansas I'm
 
06:30:15.150 --> 06:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
sorry um to me is worth over a million
 
06:30:18.030 --> 06:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
dollars um but others might not share
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
that value um and putting placing a
 
06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
value on a dog um is uh might be a
 
06:30:32.630 --> 06:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:32.640 --> 06:30:34.868 align:start position:0%

you seeing seeing no additional hands

raised excuse me representa Tes
 
06:31:00.788 --> 06:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for letting me
 
06:31:04.590 --> 06:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
ask this question
 
06:31:07.548 --> 06:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
um we're most people here are talking
 
06:31:09.948 --> 06:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
about you seem to be talking about the
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
you know dogs used for for hunting game
 
06:31:15.628 --> 06:31:15.638 align:start position:0%
and so on I can tell you personal
 
06:31:18.548 --> 06:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
experience that spending $3,000 on a dog
 
06:31:22.270 --> 06:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
is not that hard so you
 
06:31:26.468 --> 06:31:26.478 align:start position:0%
know you know do you do you have do you
 
06:31:28.830 --> 06:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
have any idea what the price is of of
 
06:31:30.910 --> 06:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
various pure
 
06:31:33.830 --> 06:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
breads I'm I'm a rescue dog kind of
 
06:31:36.830 --> 06:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
person um but I understand that they are
 
06:31:40.910 --> 06:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
can get quite uh expensive um and I also
 
06:31:45.628 --> 06:31:45.638 align:start position:0%
understand that U uh people with uh uh
 
06:31:47.708 --> 06:31:47.718 align:start position:0%
just household pets are using these
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
tracking collars to make sure that if
 
06:31:52.270 --> 06:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
the dog um escapes the yard they can
 
06:31:54.990 --> 06:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
track the dog down so the uh this is not
 
06:31:58.628 --> 06:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
exclusive to working dogs um but I agree
 
06:32:02.388 --> 06:32:02.398 align:start position:0%
that um uh purebred animals can be um
 
06:32:06.388 --> 06:32:06.398 align:start position:0%
very expensive and and a real Target for
 
06:32:06.398 --> 06:32:12.070 align:start position:0%
very expensive and and a real Target for
for

06:32:12.070 --> 06:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:15.788 --> 06:32:15.798 align:start position:0%
theft Mar thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our
 
06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions my question is in the realm of
 
06:32:26.310 --> 06:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
how easy or hard is it for the police to
 
06:32:31.190 --> 06:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:33.868 --> 06:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
perpetrator well I know in one instance
 
06:32:37.388 --> 06:32:37.398 align:start position:0%
that uh Miss Richardson has heard of um
 
06:32:40.350 --> 06:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
someone actually um tracked their collar
 
06:32:44.350 --> 06:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
to someone's home um and uh knocked on
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
the door and said I believe you have my
 
06:32:50.468 --> 06:32:50.478 align:start position:0%
dog and they said oh no no no no that's
 
06:32:52.468 --> 06:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
not true and they said I know my collar
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
is inside your um your house and with
 
06:32:59.030 --> 06:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the um the spouse let that dog out
 
06:33:01.030 --> 06:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
the back door and dog came running
 
06:33:02.990 --> 06:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
around the house to the uh to the owner
 
06:33:06.190 --> 06:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
so um I I I can't tell you how easy it
 
06:33:08.110 --> 06:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
is for police to deal with this but
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
there certainly are instances where
 
06:33:16.230 --> 06:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:18.628 --> 06:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
you seeing No Hands raised I want to
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for his
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:25.548 --> 06:33:25.558 align:start position:0%
you the chair now recognize as
 
06:33:25.558 --> 06:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
you the chair now recognize as

06:33:34.708 --> 06:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
comtoise thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:33:37.830 --> 06:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee um this
 
06:33:40.388 --> 06:33:40.398 align:start position:0%
bill oh this is uh representative comto
 
06:33:42.830 --> 06:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
from belnap 7 representing Barnstead I'm
 
06:33:44.548 --> 06:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
also a member of the environmental and
 
06:33:47.230 --> 06:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee uh which did a
 
06:33:51.070 --> 06:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
deep dive into this bill last term um
 
06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%
and this bill was revised from its
 
06:33:55.230 --> 06:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
original form to get to the form that it
 
06:33:56.510 --> 06:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
was it's in
 
06:34:00.190 --> 06:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
today um and what we have to understand
 
06:34:02.590 --> 06:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
is I I'm hearing a lot of testimony
 
06:34:05.910 --> 06:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
about the price of a th a purebred dog
 
06:34:09.190 --> 06:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
Etc but what people don't realize is is
 
06:34:10.510 --> 06:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
with these working dogs and these
 
06:34:13.868 --> 06:34:13.878 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs is it's not the value
 
06:34:16.750 --> 06:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
actual dollar value of the dog it's the
 
06:34:16.760 --> 06:34:17.948 align:start position:0%
actual dollar value of the dog it's the
time

06:34:17.948 --> 06:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:34:22.070 --> 06:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
in that's put into the training which is
 
06:34:24.548 --> 06:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
which is invaluable you cannot place
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
dollar value on that time and training
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
because a good hunting or tracking
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
dog isn't worth what you paid for it's
 
06:34:35.990 --> 06:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
worth a lot more than that and as Miss
 
06:34:37.990 --> 06:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
Richardson will
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
testify um when these collars people can
 
06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
remove the collars so it' be very hard
 
06:34:47.430 --> 06:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
to track the dogs but people think that
 
06:34:48.910 --> 06:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing the right thing because
 
06:34:50.190 --> 06:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
these dogs
 
06:34:54.548 --> 06:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
are being harmed by doing their job and
 
06:34:56.270 --> 06:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is put something
 
06:34:57.990 --> 06:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
on the books that will say to people you
 
06:35:01.150 --> 06:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
know what these dogs are healthy dogs
 
06:35:03.830 --> 06:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're they doing their job they love
 
06:35:08.750 --> 06:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
doing their job and um because dogs love
 
06:35:10.548 --> 06:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
to serve their owners and love to do
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
what they're meant to do we have all
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
different breeds some of them are house
 
06:35:15.990 --> 06:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
breeds and some of them are for tracking
 
06:35:19.590 --> 06:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
some of them are for working um and we
 
06:35:21.830 --> 06:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to allow the animal to do what it's
 
06:35:24.548 --> 06:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
meant to do and people don't not some
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
people just don't understand that and
 
06:35:28.388 --> 06:35:28.398 align:start position:0%
they think they want to save the dogs
 
06:35:30.310 --> 06:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
and they're doing them a disservice so
 
06:35:32.430 --> 06:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
they remove these collars there's been
 
06:35:33.788 --> 06:35:33.798 align:start position:0%
instances where they've removed a
 
06:35:36.310 --> 06:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
microchip which is very painful for the
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
dog um and we need to put in harsh penal
 
06:35:42.230 --> 06:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
we decided that a harsher penalty needed
 
06:35:45.948 --> 06:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
to be put in place to deter these acts
 
06:35:51.830 --> 06:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:54.430 --> 06:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative true thank you
 
06:35:55.830 --> 06:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you very much for
 
06:35:59.868 --> 06:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question taking my question
 
06:36:02.510 --> 06:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh you and some other people have talk
 
06:36:05.548 --> 06:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
about you know the value of the dog but
 
06:36:08.350 --> 06:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
this applies to any dog correct it's not
 
06:36:09.910 --> 06:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the value of the
 
06:36:12.830 --> 06:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
dog or how much time in training you did
 
06:36:14.190 --> 06:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
with a dog
 
06:36:17.708 --> 06:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
correct correct I can I can attest you I
 
06:36:20.350 --> 06:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you from personal experience
 
06:36:23.030 --> 06:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
that I had a rescue dog that someone
 
06:36:27.388 --> 06:36:27.398 align:start position:0%
actually stole um the dog cost me
 
06:36:32.230 --> 06:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
$400 um and he was a working dog and uh
 
06:36:33.868 --> 06:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
someone just didn't like the fact that
 
06:36:36.150 --> 06:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
he was a working dog and I couldn't find
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
him for three weeks and finally I
 
06:36:40.670 --> 06:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
located him and they actually ruined
 
06:36:42.788 --> 06:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
that dog I had to sell them the dog
 
06:36:44.990 --> 06:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
because the dog could no longer was no
 
06:36:49.110 --> 06:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
longer valuable as a working dog um and
 
06:36:51.868 --> 06:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
that's just a one one experience from
 
06:36:56.670 --> 06:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
for me so it's not just on the value of
 
06:36:59.110 --> 06:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
dogs but this does happen and I've
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
experienced it personally I don't know
 
06:37:04.310 --> 06:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question but um I
 
06:37:07.230 --> 06:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
hope it has thank you representative
 
06:37:09.910 --> 06:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
hoer uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:37:11.830 --> 06:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
represented for taking my
 
06:37:16.110 --> 06:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
question um the testimony is if I
 
06:37:17.910 --> 06:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
understand it that we need a class B
 
06:37:20.670 --> 06:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
felony to make sure the punishment is
 
06:37:24.750 --> 06:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
strong enough to deter dog theft
 
06:37:28.190 --> 06:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
my question is how many people have
 
06:37:31.468 --> 06:37:31.478 align:start position:0%
actually served time for stealing dogs
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
that you know of in other words if
 
06:37:36.190 --> 06:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
somebody steals a dog and they end up
 
06:37:39.110 --> 06:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to jail for nine months they
 
06:37:40.990 --> 06:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
probably won't do it again but I don't
 
06:37:44.150 --> 06:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
know that it's actually being
 
06:37:46.270 --> 06:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
prosecuted uh thank you representative
 
06:37:48.830 --> 06:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
for the question I cannot answer that at
 
06:37:52.670 --> 06:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
this time um because I haven't really
 
06:37:54.830 --> 06:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
delved into it Miss Richardson is really
 
06:37:58.110 --> 06:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
the expert on on this bill and has done
 
06:38:00.788 --> 06:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of research um not only in this
 
06:38:02.990 --> 06:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
state but in other states and she could
 
06:38:04.750 --> 06:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
probably answer all of those questions
 
06:38:06.230 --> 06:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
better than I
 
06:38:06.240 --> 06:38:08.350 align:start position:0%
better than I
can

06:38:08.350 --> 06:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:38:11.590 --> 06:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
C representative Rose thank you Mr
 
06:38:14.510 --> 06:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:38:18.270 --> 06:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious is why this
 
06:38:21.948 --> 06:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
bill is only to dogs because I have
 
06:38:24.110 --> 06:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
several friends that have pets that are
 
06:38:27.708 --> 06:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
are not dogss that they have paid a lot
 
06:38:30.070 --> 06:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
of money for and or got for free and
 
06:38:31.830 --> 06:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
love them just as much and they're
 
06:38:34.350 --> 06:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
they're just as valuable to that person
 
06:38:36.190 --> 06:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
so would there is there a reason this is
 
06:38:39.070 --> 06:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
only to dogs and not all
 
06:38:41.430 --> 06:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
pets um thank you representative for the
 
06:38:45.270 --> 06:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
question uh there isn't a reason it just
 
06:38:49.590 --> 06:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
seems that um this H this is a a
 
06:38:51.750 --> 06:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
movement across the United States
 
06:38:55.070 --> 06:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to dogs dog theft is real
 
06:38:58.948 --> 06:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
and it is happening in all 50 states um
 
06:39:02.190 --> 06:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
so I can't say why we haven't addressed
 
06:39:06.070 --> 06:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
other uh pets in there but
 
06:39:08.430 --> 06:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh so I can't really answer that
 
06:39:12.150 --> 06:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
question tell you the truth
 
06:39:15.190 --> 06:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
soes Wallace uh thank you Mr chairman
 
06:39:17.468 --> 06:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my uh question
 
06:39:21.030 --> 06:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative um seeing that the the
 
06:39:23.708 --> 06:39:23.718 align:start position:0%
theft of dogs is growing and it's a real
 
06:39:26.830 --> 06:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
problem Nationwide um would it also not
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
make sense maybe to have some penalties
 
06:39:31.150 --> 06:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
on whoever might be trading or receiving
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
these uh stolen kidna
 
06:39:38.628 --> 06:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
dogs uh thank you for the question um
 
06:39:41.190 --> 06:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes um we did not want to make the bill
 
06:39:43.708 --> 06:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
too complicated to start out with
 
06:39:47.350 --> 06:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
because um we wanted to we narrowed it
 
06:39:50.830 --> 06:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
down um because there's a lot of other
 
06:39:52.468 --> 06:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
things involved in this because we have
 
06:39:54.590 --> 06:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with law enforcement
 
06:39:57.110 --> 06:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
um Animal Control Etc so we didn't want
 
06:39:59.830 --> 06:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
to do too broad of a bill and wanted to
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
really focus on this but if that's
 
06:40:05.350 --> 06:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
something um that you think should be in
 
06:40:09.708 --> 06:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:13.670 --> 06:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:16.190 --> 06:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
Knight thank you chairman uh thanks for
 
06:40:18.750 --> 06:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question what is the total
 
06:40:21.628 --> 06:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
number currently on the theft of dogs in
 
06:40:21.638 --> 06:40:22.910 align:start position:0%
number currently on the theft of dogs in
New

06:40:22.910 --> 06:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:40:25.110 --> 06:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh thank you for the question
 
06:40:27.310 --> 06:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
I don't have that
 
06:40:30.590 --> 06:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
number um so I can't answer that
 
06:40:33.750 --> 06:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
question you have a followup question
 
06:40:36.708 --> 06:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and your dog was when you
 
06:40:38.510 --> 06:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
found your dog was there anything
 
06:40:40.788 --> 06:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
physically wrong with your
 
06:40:44.230 --> 06:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
dog um no my dog was perfectly healthy
 
06:40:46.310 --> 06:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
except that he was a working dog and you
 
06:40:49.868 --> 06:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
cannot confine a working dog and stop it
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
from doing its job and then think it's
 
06:40:56.948 --> 06:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
okay for them to come back um you dogs
 
06:41:00.388 --> 06:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
are trained or dogs are bred for certain
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
purposes and when you try and change
 
06:41:04.990 --> 06:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
that and you pull them out of their
 
06:41:09.948 --> 06:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
environments it's very hard to uh you
 
06:41:12.270 --> 06:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
know for them to get back into
 
06:41:12.280 --> 06:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
know for them to get back into
that

06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:18.070 --> 06:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
so represent
 
06:41:20.670 --> 06:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
board thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:41:25.788 --> 06:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so if you uh
 
06:41:27.830 --> 06:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire if a theft
 
06:41:29.788 --> 06:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
is worth over
 
06:41:34.030 --> 06:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
$1,500 that is classified as a class a
 
06:41:37.670 --> 06:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
felony if it's between ,000 and $1,500
 
06:41:40.510 --> 06:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
is a class B felony anything less than
 
06:41:44.990 --> 06:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
that is a misdemeanor so if you have a
 
06:41:48.910 --> 06:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
dog that is worth let's call it
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
$2,000 including its color
 
06:41:55.990 --> 06:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh that could be prosecuted by a present
 
06:41:59.788 --> 06:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
law as a class a felony and you would
 
06:42:03.468 --> 06:42:03.478 align:start position:0%
make it a class B felony is that not
 
06:42:07.510 --> 06:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
true uh thank you for the question
 
06:42:11.190 --> 06:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
um before this it was classified as a
 
06:42:13.750 --> 06:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and we push it up to a class
 
06:42:13.760 --> 06:42:14.590 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and we push it up to a class
B

06:42:14.590 --> 06:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
B
 
06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
felony and um because some people had a
 
06:42:20.350 --> 06:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
problem with the class a felony and
 
06:42:21.628 --> 06:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
because people are saying well how do
 
06:42:24.110 --> 06:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
you put a price on a dog what is a dog
 
06:42:24.120 --> 06:42:25.628 align:start position:0%
you put a price on a dog what is a dog
worth

06:42:25.628 --> 06:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
worth
 
06:42:30.590 --> 06:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I would you know and I'm not uh a
 
06:42:32.430 --> 06:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a judge or anything but I
 
06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
would assume that you would be able to
 
06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
go for further damages I mean these
 
06:42:41.468 --> 06:42:41.478 align:start position:0%
callers alone are upwards of $1,500 to
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
$2,000 as you will hear testimony I mean
 
06:42:46.590 --> 06:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
dogs have been killed because owners
 
06:42:48.350 --> 06:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't have have them track they' been
 
06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
run over I mean there are horrific
 
06:42:54.910 --> 06:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
stories out there and um
 
06:42:56.788 --> 06:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
but when we heard this in the
 
06:42:58.430 --> 06:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
environments and agricultural committee
 
06:43:01.750 --> 06:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
the class B felony seemed to be uh what
 
06:43:04.990 --> 06:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
was um what we thought was the right
 
06:43:13.230 --> 06:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:15.750 --> 06:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
so seeing no further questions I want to
 
06:43:17.548 --> 06:43:17.558 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for her
 
06:43:22.670 --> 06:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:22.680 --> 06:43:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
chair

06:43:40.150 --> 06:43:40.160 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire and I've been involved
 
06:43:54.270 --> 06:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
with pure bed dog since 1985 we have
 
06:43:56.230 --> 06:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
personal dogs that work in the woods and
 
06:43:59.110 --> 06:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
Fields including a shed antler dog human
 
06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
tracking dog and two dogs that are
 
06:44:03.070 --> 06:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
licensed with fishing game to track
 
06:44:03.080 --> 06:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
licensed with fishing game to track
wounded

06:44:04.070 --> 06:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
wounded
 
06:44:06.670 --> 06:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
game I've submitted a pretty detailed
 
06:44:09.110 --> 06:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony for you and I urge you
 
06:44:11.110 --> 06:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
to read it it's got a lot of information
 
06:44:13.150 --> 06:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
in it from other other parts of the
 
06:44:15.868 --> 06:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
state as well uh this bill was created
 
06:44:17.910 --> 06:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
at my behest by the sponsors to address
 
06:44:20.110 --> 06:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
a growing problem the problem is
 
06:44:21.868 --> 06:44:21.878 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and not restricted to New
 
06:44:24.110 --> 06:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire nor to hunting dogs
 
06:44:25.868 --> 06:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
it's a problem in all the states for all
 
06:44:29.430 --> 06:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the dogs be they working or pet dogs and
 
06:44:31.750 --> 06:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh as you heard it's pet theft and
 
06:44:34.590 --> 06:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
collar tampering current law does not
 
06:44:36.750 --> 06:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
specifi specifically address tracking
 
06:44:39.070 --> 06:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
collars tracking devices or
 
06:44:41.708 --> 06:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
identification microchips only
 
06:44:44.548 --> 06:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
callers this absence unfortunately has
 
06:44:46.270 --> 06:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
caused law enforcement to be hesitant to
 
06:44:47.830 --> 06:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
press charges for tracking collar
 
06:44:50.190 --> 06:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
tampering or removal and there is zero
 
06:44:52.070 --> 06:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law addressing microchip
 
06:44:55.430 --> 06:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
removal at all my dogs wear a GPS collar
 
06:44:57.150 --> 06:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
while they work and many hunting and
 
06:44:59.868 --> 06:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
working dogs also wear them additionally
 
06:45:02.110 --> 06:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
many pet dogs now wear a type of GPS
 
06:45:05.190 --> 06:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
collar or GPS tag and a large portion of
 
06:45:06.628 --> 06:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
dogs are now
 
06:45:08.830 --> 06:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
microchipped unfortunately there's a
 
06:45:10.990 --> 06:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
population segment that are catching
 
06:45:13.190 --> 06:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
dogs removing collars shutting tracking
 
06:45:15.628 --> 06:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
collars off and even destroying tracking
 
06:45:18.350 --> 06:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
collars and taking the dogs to either
 
06:45:20.430 --> 06:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
save them from their misconception that
 
06:45:22.708 --> 06:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
the dogs are abused or to flip the dogs
 
06:45:24.388 --> 06:45:24.398 align:start position:0%
for profit
 
06:45:26.708 --> 06:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
aside from the dog's value callers can
 
06:45:29.388 --> 06:45:29.398 align:start position:0%
run $100 up to thousands of dollars
 
06:45:31.990 --> 06:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of caller you have
 
06:45:34.468 --> 06:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
many states do have tracking collar laws
 
06:45:36.230 --> 06:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
in some States they're felonies and in
 
06:45:38.070 --> 06:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
other states they're misdemeanors it
 
06:45:41.190 --> 06:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
varies by State uh microchips are a form
 
06:45:43.190 --> 06:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
of positive identification and tracking
 
06:45:46.230 --> 06:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
collar are a way for owners to tr M
 
06:45:48.070 --> 06:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
Richardson uh we do have to limit
 
06:45:52.388 --> 06:45:52.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:55.670 --> 06:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
minutes seeing no no hands raised I want
 
06:45:58.350 --> 06:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
to I want to thank the uh the rich for
 
06:46:00.110 --> 06:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me represent
 
06:46:02.948 --> 06:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
Hopper thank you Mr chair a quick
 
06:46:05.948 --> 06:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
question how um I'm having a little
 
06:46:07.868 --> 06:46:07.878 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the penalty so what I'm
 
06:46:10.830 --> 06:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
trying to find out is how many people
 
06:46:14.430 --> 06:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
are arrested for stealing dogs now and
 
06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
how many of them have been given jail
 
06:46:21.110 --> 06:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
time of 9 months 6 months in other words
 
06:46:24.708 --> 06:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
are we increasing a penal to deter
 
06:46:27.430 --> 06:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
something when we're not even
 
06:46:27.440 --> 06:46:29.350 align:start position:0%
something when we're not even
imp

06:46:29.350 --> 06:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
imp
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're not even enforcing the law
 
06:46:37.110 --> 06:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
now uh currently when someone is uh
 
06:46:40.830 --> 06:46:40.840 align:start position:0%

in New Hampshire which represent
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
thousands of dog owners and in New
 
06:47:54.830 --> 06:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for instance in 2019 there
 
06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
were 141 dog performance events hosted
 
06:48:01.788 --> 06:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh with more than 23,000 dogs
 
06:48:04.590 --> 06:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
participating so it's a very popular
 
06:48:07.628 --> 06:48:07.638 align:start position:0%
sport in New Hampshire and just want to
 
06:48:09.628 --> 06:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the current New
 
06:48:09.638 --> 06:48:10.628 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the current New
Hampshire

06:48:10.628 --> 06:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:48:12.990 --> 06:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
law the current New Hampshire law
 
06:48:16.030 --> 06:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
regarding theft of a dog um has not been
 
06:48:17.548 --> 06:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
updated since
 
06:48:21.190 --> 06:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
1977 I did look at the initated laws so
 
06:48:22.948 --> 06:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
it being a misdemeanor has been in place
 
06:48:25.788 --> 06:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
for a very long time and has not been
 
06:48:28.910 --> 06:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
updated to reflect the current value of
 
06:48:31.510 --> 06:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
some of these dogs that are working dogs
 
06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
and purpose bread dogs uh pure breads
 
06:48:37.110 --> 06:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
that are worth quite a bit of money uh
 
06:48:41.110 --> 06:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
as rep qua noted uh especially given
 
06:48:43.670 --> 06:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
that they may be highly trained um and
 
06:48:46.070 --> 06:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
that also the electronic technology for
 
06:48:48.548 --> 06:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
tracking the dogs um can be quite
 
06:48:50.830 --> 06:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and likely was not available
 
06:48:51.948 --> 06:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
back in
 
06:48:55.190 --> 06:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
1977 um I just wanted to acknowledge
 
06:48:57.670 --> 06:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
that in my written testimony that I
 
06:48:59.468 --> 06:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
shared with all of you there is a link
 
06:49:03.030 --> 06:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
to an AKC article from 2018 noting that
 
06:49:05.110 --> 06:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
dog theft has been on the rise for
 
06:49:09.708 --> 06:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
several years now and on average uh the
 
06:49:13.510 --> 06:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
studies estimate that about two million
 
06:49:16.110 --> 06:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
dogs are stolen each year in the United
 
06:49:19.590 --> 06:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
States um I can share with you that it's
 
06:49:22.030 --> 06:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
an unfortunate problem because there are
 
06:49:23.990 --> 06:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
those who recognize the value of these
 
06:49:25.948 --> 06:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
dogs and they're looking for a way to
 
06:49:28.430 --> 06:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
make quick cash or to breed the dogs for
 
06:49:31.070 --> 06:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
money so it's not specific to just
 
06:49:33.310 --> 06:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs or working
 
06:49:37.230 --> 06:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
dogs is over you have to
 
06:49:40.670 --> 06:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
limit uh testimony two minutes per
 
06:49:42.788 --> 06:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
witness represent T you have a question
 
06:49:47.430 --> 06:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
for the witness I have a question U this
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is not only for working
 
06:49:53.708 --> 06:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
dogs pets and so on is this also apply
 
06:49:58.110 --> 06:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
to dogs that are purpose bread or not
 
06:50:01.590 --> 06:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
purpose bread but used for service dogs
 
06:50:04.990 --> 06:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
like you know for a veteran and so on
 
06:50:09.510 --> 06:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
like General bulldock has one cost
 
06:50:13.310 --> 06:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
$30,000 I understand yes I can share
 
06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
with you I had a contact a couple of
 
06:50:18.110 --> 06:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
months ago from a woman in Maine who
 
06:50:20.230 --> 06:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
relies on a service dog the dog was
 
06:50:22.830 --> 06:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
stolen so that it could be bred um she's
 
06:50:25.868 --> 06:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
been unable to uh get the dog back
 
06:50:29.468 --> 06:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
despite a court order um in Maine I also
 
06:50:31.990 --> 06:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
had probably six weeks ago police
 
06:50:33.708 --> 06:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
officer in Worcester Massachusetts
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
contact me noting that dog theft has
 
06:50:38.990 --> 06:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
been an issue in that
 
06:50:41.948 --> 06:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um I I there was a question
 
06:50:44.430 --> 06:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
earlier and I just wanted to offer that
 
06:50:46.430 --> 06:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
there are two states that apparently
 
06:50:48.868 --> 06:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
impose different charges and penalties
 
06:50:51.190 --> 06:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
based on the monetary value of the
 
06:50:54.430 --> 06:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
stolen dog so it may be that an owner
 
06:50:57.948 --> 06:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
could in fact produce some evidence of
 
06:51:00.590 --> 06:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know the value of the GPS caller or
 
06:51:02.388 --> 06:51:02.398 align:start position:0%
of the dog themselves the hours of
 
06:51:04.750 --> 06:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
training that's been put in uh to assist
 
06:51:08.030 --> 06:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
a court with the appropriate uh charge
 
06:51:14.070 --> 06:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:17.830 --> 06:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:20.030 --> 06:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:51:21.948 --> 06:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:51:25.070 --> 06:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like what I'm hearing about
 
06:51:27.030 --> 06:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
the penalties and that's mainly what I
 
06:51:30.150 --> 06:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that a class a felony
 
06:51:32.590 --> 06:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
was not considered because a lot of
 
06:51:35.468 --> 06:51:35.478 align:start position:0%
times they plead down or or whatever but
 
06:51:37.270 --> 06:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
it seems like whether it's a class a
 
06:51:40.510 --> 06:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
felony or a or B or C Class A A or B
 
06:51:44.628 --> 06:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
felony or or a Class A misdemeanor that
 
06:51:46.310 --> 06:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
could happen with any of them because
 
06:51:49.830 --> 06:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum penalty can be be held down
 
06:51:51.468 --> 06:51:51.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you would be
 
06:51:53.868 --> 06:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
open to any reconsider a of the Class A
 
06:51:57.548 --> 06:51:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:01.750 --> 06:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
you uh this is DC oer responding if I
 
06:52:05.070 --> 06:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
may Mr chair I just wanted to reflect
 
06:52:07.868 --> 06:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
this bill which is a refile uh and came
 
06:52:10.388 --> 06:52:10.398 align:start position:0%
out favorably from house environment and
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture I did monitor the house
 
06:52:16.150 --> 06:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee on finance uh last year which
 
06:52:18.910 --> 06:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
considered this bill and they raised
 
06:52:21.388 --> 06:52:21.398 align:start position:0%
which is why I raised it in my testimony
 
06:52:23.830 --> 06:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not a class felony was
 
06:52:25.948 --> 06:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
significant after understanding the
 
06:52:28.990 --> 06:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
value of some of these dogs but also
 
06:52:31.190 --> 06:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they were not the
 
06:52:32.868 --> 06:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
committee with subject matter
 
06:52:35.708 --> 06:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to increase the felony to a
 
06:52:38.510 --> 06:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
class A um and I think part of that as a
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
reflection of class A felonies if you
 
06:52:44.350 --> 06:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
look in the statute um is theft of
 
06:52:47.110 --> 06:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
property over a, doll and a class B
 
06:52:48.990 --> 06:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
felony in New Hampshire is theft of
 
06:52:51.590 --> 06:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
property over 500 but less than a
 
06:52:54.388 --> 06:52:54.398 align:start position:0%
thousand if you look at the general
 
06:52:57.350 --> 06:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
statutory language um so I just would
 
06:53:00.788 --> 06:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to perhaps review that
 
06:53:02.388 --> 06:53:02.398 align:start position:0%
in making your
 
06:53:05.548 --> 06:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
determination thank you representative
 
06:53:09.788 --> 06:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
G um you mentioned that um I guess dog
 
06:53:12.548 --> 06:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
death is on the rise in the United
 
06:53:16.388 --> 06:53:16.398 align:start position:0%
States um do you know or have you heard
 
06:53:19.030 --> 06:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the people that are stealing the dogs
 
06:53:21.750 --> 06:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:24.628 --> 06:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
offenders I'm sorry I don't have access
 
06:53:28.150 --> 06:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
to that information I think um if I were
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
to speculate I would say
 
06:53:33.230 --> 06:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
yes because it sounds as though there is
 
06:53:35.868 --> 06:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
kind of a black market uh for those
 
06:53:38.868 --> 06:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
individuals who see this as an easy way
 
06:53:45.628 --> 06:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:47.788 --> 06:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
cash represent Gap right you recognize
 
06:53:50.430 --> 06:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
for a followup question yes well I guess
 
06:53:51.990 --> 06:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
for me I'm struggling with the fact that
 
06:53:55.190 --> 06:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
you want to make it felony so have you
 
06:53:58.910 --> 06:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
considered maybe um uh First
 
06:54:02.468 --> 06:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
Defense um you know misdemeanor second
 
06:54:06.110 --> 06:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
offense maybe something else u a
 
06:54:06.120 --> 06:54:07.110 align:start position:0%
offense maybe something else u a
stronger

06:54:07.110 --> 06:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:19.230 --> 06:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:21.830 --> 06:54:21.840 align:start position:0%

it

06:58:02.910 --> 06:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:05.310 --> 06:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Muse represent
 
06:58:07.948 --> 06:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
Hopper thank you Mr you asking are you
 
06:58:10.510 --> 06:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
asking a question I I make I was going
 
06:58:12.910 --> 06:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
to make a point before we started voting
 
06:58:12.920 --> 06:58:13.670 align:start position:0%
to make a point before we started voting
on

06:58:13.670 --> 06:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:58:16.830 --> 06:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
it are you making a point of order no
 
06:58:19.628 --> 06:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
just a point what we are on a limited
 
06:58:22.510 --> 06:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
time but I realize that I just I I I
 
06:58:25.670 --> 06:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I will support
 
06:58:29.990 --> 06:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
this if it includes the gri amendment
 
06:58:32.750 --> 06:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
which makes a second offense a felony
 
06:58:35.030 --> 06:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
but not the first I don't think this
 
06:58:38.388 --> 06:58:38.398 align:start position:0%
comes even close to the Penalty equaling
 
06:58:40.070 --> 06:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
the crime well there's going to be a
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
motion and we'll open up for discussion
 
06:58:45.430 --> 06:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
at this time that the chair is opening
 
06:58:48.590 --> 06:58:48.600 align:start position:0%

06:58:51.150 --> 06:58:51.160 align:start position:0%

I
move

06:58:57.990 --> 06:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:01.548 --> 06:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
38 is there a second of that motion I'll
 
06:59:04.190 --> 06:59:04.200 align:start position:0%

by representative green represent B you
 
06:59:09.868 --> 06:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:09.878 --> 06:59:12.270 align:start position:0%
 
motion

06:59:12.270 --> 06:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:59:16.030 --> 06:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
well I kind what Linda has suggested is
 
06:59:18.750 --> 06:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
something that I've always
 
06:59:18.760 --> 06:59:20.910 align:start position:0%
something that I've always
felt

06:59:20.910 --> 06:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
felt
 
06:59:24.868 --> 06:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
position but on these dogs working dogs
 
06:59:27.510 --> 06:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
they are extremely expensive there's a
 
06:59:31.110 --> 06:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
lot of time in in there and and I'm in a
 
06:59:34.388 --> 06:59:34.398 align:start position:0%
position now I have a dog which I bought
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
earlier last
 
06:59:37.990 --> 06:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
year very
 
06:59:40.628 --> 06:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
expensive if anybody wanted to steal my
 
06:59:49.948 --> 06:59:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:54.150 --> 06:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
about smok okay dou problem isn't that
 
06:59:56.628 --> 06:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
part of your family it is part of my
 
06:59:59.830 --> 06:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
family at my age that's what happens
 
06:59:59.840 --> 07:00:01.270 align:start position:0%
family at my age that's what happens
kids

07:00:01.270 --> 07:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
kids
 
07:00:03.708 --> 07:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
leave get
 
07:00:05.948 --> 07:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr
 
07:00:10.468 --> 07:00:10.478 align:start position:0%
chairman on this motion I have a problem
 
07:00:13.628 --> 07:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
and I hope I can express it well
 
07:00:17.910 --> 07:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
here I am inclined to be a to pass but I
 
07:00:22.788 --> 07:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
find that in some cases a def felony is
 
07:00:26.310 --> 07:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
not enough how do we can we amend this
 
07:00:29.070 --> 07:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
thing so that in in the case where this
 
07:00:31.590 --> 07:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
dog is say and I got a note here
 
07:00:35.350 --> 07:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
somebody said a purebred show dog or a p
 
07:00:37.310 --> 07:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
breed dog can be
 
07:00:40.590 --> 07:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
$2500 my point is can we make this a
 
07:00:43.468 --> 07:00:43.478 align:start position:0%
graduated type thing a certain point for
 
07:00:46.548 --> 07:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
a B felony and an a felony is that
 
07:00:49.270 --> 07:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
something could be amended so we that's
 
07:00:51.430 --> 07:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
certainly something that can be done I
 
07:00:52.590 --> 07:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
think they
 
07:00:55.430 --> 07:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
often this is based on testimony the
 
07:00:57.430 --> 07:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty is is establishing the value
 
07:01:00.830 --> 07:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
of dogs is some difficult to do
 
07:01:04.110 --> 07:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
especially in a court all right listen I
 
07:01:05.590 --> 07:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem I I had a pure
 
07:01:08.150 --> 07:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
bread dog it cost $3,000 if you stole
 
07:01:10.830 --> 07:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
$3,000 in cash for me it would be a
 
07:01:13.548 --> 07:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
class a felon I what I understand is
 
07:01:15.590 --> 07:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
that this is this is a fight to make
 
07:01:17.548 --> 07:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
this a class B felony in the first place
 
07:01:19.190 --> 07:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm willing to take the baby steps to
 
07:01:21.270 --> 07:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
get there I would support making it a
 
07:01:23.510 --> 07:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
class a felony because I think stealing
 
07:01:28.510 --> 07:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
a dog is is inherently wrong in it
 
07:01:32.190 --> 07:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
is listen stealing anything is wrong
 
07:01:34.110 --> 07:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
stealing this my water bottle is wrong
 
07:01:36.070 --> 07:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
stealing my briefcase is wrong stealing
 
07:01:38.548 --> 07:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
my computer's wrong stealing someone's
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
house pet I find to be more disturbing
 
07:01:42.628 --> 07:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
just given the known emotional
 
07:01:44.708 --> 07:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
attachment people have to that property
 
07:01:46.030 --> 07:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
I would I wouldn't really lose much
 
07:01:49.230 --> 07:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
sleep over the loss of you the stuff I I
 
07:01:51.230 --> 07:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
have with me here but it when it comes
 
07:01:54.350 --> 07:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
to a house pet I find that to be
 
07:01:57.468 --> 07:01:57.478 align:start position:0%
very unfortunate and I would say if this
 
07:01:58.990 --> 07:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
was any other type of property I don't
 
07:02:01.750 --> 07:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
know why uh house pets especially a dog
 
07:02:04.910 --> 07:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
in this case is basically getting less
 
07:02:07.030 --> 07:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
consideration as property because that's
 
07:02:09.468 --> 07:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
what a dog is it's it's your property R
 
07:02:11.270 --> 07:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that dog if you I understand
 
07:02:12.430 --> 07:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can get them from rescue
 
07:02:13.750 --> 07:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
shelters you didn't spend that much
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
money on the dog but for the you know we
 
07:02:19.270 --> 07:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
for us startop distinguishing between oh
 
07:02:20.788 --> 07:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
did you buy it this it's not what you
 
07:02:22.350 --> 07:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
pay for it's what it's worth to you you
 
07:02:24.310 --> 07:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's how baseball
 
07:02:27.990 --> 07:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
car and to me making this a class B
 
07:02:30.150 --> 07:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
felony I I would find to be very
 
07:02:32.190 --> 07:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate I would support making it a
 
07:02:35.270 --> 07:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
Class A I would try passing it as a
 
07:02:40.708 --> 07:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:45.190 --> 07:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
statement I apologize I was out of Mr
 
07:02:48.150 --> 07:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
chairman a point of
 
07:02:48.160 --> 07:02:50.468 align:start position:0%
chairman a point of
order

07:02:50.468 --> 07:02:50.478 align:start position:0%
order
 
07:02:53.830 --> 07:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
I represent your point of order has been
 
07:02:55.990 --> 07:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
raised I'd like to raise the point of
 
07:02:59.670 --> 07:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
order yes sir you've been
 
07:03:02.628 --> 07:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
recognized it I I thought that I heard
 
07:03:04.548 --> 07:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
the chairman say that we were going to
 
07:03:06.350 --> 07:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
four o'clock I'm just wondering if
 
07:03:08.150 --> 07:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's still in
 
07:03:10.548 --> 07:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
effect well I did say that we we I've
 
07:03:11.868 --> 07:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
been given the green light to go a
 
07:03:13.350 --> 07:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
little longer uh there is going to be
 
07:03:15.190 --> 07:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
some maintenance done that would require
 
07:03:18.830 --> 07:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
the internet to be disconnected so are
 
07:03:21.468 --> 07:03:21.478 align:start position:0%
you asking me is that just a problem if
 
07:03:22.628 --> 07:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
we continue
 
07:03:26.430 --> 07:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
this miss another point of order if if I
 
07:03:29.468 --> 07:03:29.478 align:start position:0%
may I guess I'm recognized um are we
 
07:03:31.868 --> 07:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
going to go through our normal procedure
 
07:03:34.150 --> 07:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
of one question per person and this a
 
07:03:37.270 --> 07:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
regular executive session and it will go
 
07:03:40.110 --> 07:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
on like one until you reach the point
 
07:03:42.628 --> 07:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
where we have to stop is that
 
07:03:45.070 --> 07:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
right the question you're asking is not
 
07:03:46.990 --> 07:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
a point of order you're not asking about
 
07:03:49.548 --> 07:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
a ruling of the chair or a parliamentary
 
07:03:50.750 --> 07:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
procedure you're asking a general
 
07:03:52.150 --> 07:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
question your point of order is out of
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
order represent
 
07:03:56.788 --> 07:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
Marson thank you Mr chair what I was
 
07:03:59.910 --> 07:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
saying was the value of a dog can be
 
07:04:02.270 --> 07:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
determined by many different factors I
 
07:04:04.350 --> 07:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
have a daughter-in-law that's in the dog
 
07:04:06.430 --> 07:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
raising and breeding and selling they
 
07:04:08.270 --> 07:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
know the values of different breeds in
 
07:04:10.590 --> 07:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
different dos and many other factors
 
07:04:13.150 --> 07:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
come into play so I'm just saying I
 
07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
would like to see an amendment that
 
07:04:17.990 --> 07:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
grades the penalty if you catch the P
 
07:04:20.350 --> 07:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
one of my questions if you recall had to
 
07:04:23.590 --> 07:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
do with I we catching these people
 
07:04:25.150 --> 07:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
because it's a move point if we don't
 
07:04:25.160 --> 07:04:27.030 align:start position:0%
because it's a move point if we don't
catch

07:04:27.030 --> 07:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
catch
 
07:04:31.110 --> 07:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
them thank you representative
 
07:04:34.788 --> 07:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chair
 
07:04:38.628 --> 07:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
um I think the bill is okay except that
 
07:04:42.310 --> 07:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
I think that the penalty is wrong um
 
07:04:47.070 --> 07:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
based on only based on value Alone um
 
07:04:49.548 --> 07:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
and I think a simple Amendment would be
 
07:04:53.468 --> 07:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
to uh strike the felony
 
07:04:57.670 --> 07:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
class B felony to just make it a felony
 
07:05:02.388 --> 07:05:02.398 align:start position:0%
and then let the value of the theft say
 
07:05:05.708 --> 07:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
whether it is a class A or
 
07:05:11.110 --> 07:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:14.230 --> 07:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
say representative B thank you Mr
 
07:05:19.150 --> 07:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think uh representative B
 
07:05:21.150 --> 07:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
and I are going to agree on something
 
07:05:21.160 --> 07:05:25.868 align:start position:0%
and I are going to agree on something
today

07:05:25.868 --> 07:05:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:29.310 --> 07:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
um you know to start off with a class B
 
07:05:31.468 --> 07:05:31.478 align:start position:0%
felony I'm just having a big problem
 
07:05:34.590 --> 07:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
with it because I look at Chicago laws
 
07:05:39.230 --> 07:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
how well they work um so I'm sure this
 
07:05:41.670 --> 07:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
being a class B felony will just send
 
07:05:43.430 --> 07:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
everybody that's going to steal dogs you
 
07:05:45.628 --> 07:05:45.638 align:start position:0%
know oh I guess I got to get a job at
 
07:05:46.628 --> 07:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
the gas
 
07:05:46.638 --> 07:05:48.270 align:start position:0%
the gas
station

07:05:48.270 --> 07:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
station
 
07:05:51.350 --> 07:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you know it it I just look at it Mr
 
07:05:55.990 --> 07:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
chair is it it's it's a Feelgood bill I
 
07:05:58.670 --> 07:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
mean am I for punishing people that
 
07:06:00.910 --> 07:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
steal dogs I would be devastated if my
 
07:06:04.350 --> 07:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
dog came up this you know Annie is worth
 
07:06:07.388 --> 07:06:07.398 align:start position:0%
a million dollars to me
 
07:06:10.190 --> 07:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
but you know it isn't going to you know
 
07:06:14.310 --> 07:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
Class B is not going to stop the
 
07:06:16.868 --> 07:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
criminals just like out in
 
07:06:19.270 --> 07:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
Chicago you know you look at the the
 
07:06:21.830 --> 07:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
crime rate and um you know like
 
07:06:23.910 --> 07:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative bord
 
07:06:27.430 --> 07:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
said you know let the value we have
 
07:06:30.670 --> 07:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
current laws he makes sense on that we
 
07:06:33.350 --> 07:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
have current laws that dictate what it's
 
07:06:35.070 --> 07:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
going to
 
07:06:38.750 --> 07:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
be you know with the value so if it's
 
07:06:41.868 --> 07:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
more than $2500 I guess it is a a Class
 
07:06:44.948 --> 07:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
B or so you know I'm going to be voting
 
07:06:48.270 --> 07:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:50.510 --> 07:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
07:06:50.520 --> 07:06:53.830 align:start position:0%
you representative
n

07:06:53.830 --> 07:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:56.468 --> 07:06:56.478 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um thanks colleagues
 
07:07:00.830 --> 07:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I'm inclined to agree
 
07:07:04.230 --> 07:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
with this bill but also think that it
 
07:07:07.190 --> 07:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
needs an amendment and I I don't
 
07:07:10.310 --> 07:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
understand why we're uh limiting it only
 
07:07:13.628 --> 07:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
to dogs as well as uh representative
 
07:07:17.030 --> 07:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
Road stated it just seems like it should
 
07:07:17.040 --> 07:07:18.030 align:start position:0%
Road stated it just seems like it should
be

07:07:18.030 --> 07:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:07:21.310 --> 07:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
more broadly to pets it's it's like kind
 
07:07:21.320 --> 07:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
more broadly to pets it's it's like kind
of

07:07:22.230 --> 07:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:07:24.590 --> 07:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's it's kind of biased
 
07:07:27.310 --> 07:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
and then what other concern I have is
 
07:07:30.230 --> 07:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
consistent lack of data on all of our
 
07:07:32.788 --> 07:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
issues that are being brought forward we
 
07:07:34.788 --> 07:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
need to know how many people are already
 
07:07:37.030 --> 07:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
in trouble for this how many are second
 
07:07:39.830 --> 07:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
offenders right now we're just taking
 
07:07:42.510 --> 07:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
the words of everybody saying this is a
 
07:07:46.430 --> 07:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
problem and we have you know nothing
 
07:07:46.440 --> 07:07:47.788 align:start position:0%
problem and we have you know nothing
solid

07:07:47.788 --> 07:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
solid
 
07:07:51.030 --> 07:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm having major problems making up
 
07:07:58.990 --> 07:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:02.110 --> 07:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
data representative true thank you Mr
 
07:08:06.270 --> 07:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
chair um yeah once again uh know
 
07:08:09.910 --> 07:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative kin Knight agree we agree
 
07:08:13.910 --> 07:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
often um I've got I can appreciate the
 
07:08:16.350 --> 07:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
fact that we we want to get these bills
 
07:08:20.548 --> 07:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
to to the house to the floor and I just
 
07:08:22.468 --> 07:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
I've got so many questions one of the
 
07:08:28.350 --> 07:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
questions is why is it just dogs um uh
 
07:08:31.388 --> 07:08:31.398 align:start position:0%
are the are the penalties too harsh um I
 
07:08:33.270 --> 07:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'd have to think long and hard about
 
07:08:37.750 --> 07:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
that um is uh is it needed is this bill
 
07:08:39.788 --> 07:08:39.798 align:start position:0%
needed I I don't know how many dogs are
 
07:08:43.830 --> 07:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
stolen in New Hampshire is it enforcable
 
07:08:47.750 --> 07:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um evidently it's not not being enforced
 
07:08:50.788 --> 07:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
now uh maybe if we increase the
 
07:08:52.948 --> 07:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
penalties maybe prosecutors would be
 
07:08:56.388 --> 07:08:56.398 align:start position:0%
more apt to to enforce it but way too
 
07:08:58.510 --> 07:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
many questions for me to uh to support
 
07:09:03.350 --> 07:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:06.270 --> 07:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
07:09:08.510 --> 07:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr
 
07:09:11.190 --> 07:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and I think that hell might
 
07:09:13.510 --> 07:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
freeze over today I agree with John Bert
 
07:09:16.270 --> 07:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
and representative Marston and um I am
 
07:09:20.310 --> 07:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
also opposed to the class B felony thank
 
07:09:20.320 --> 07:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
also opposed to the class B felony thank
you

07:09:31.910 --> 07:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:33.910 --> 07:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
well my I'm just listening to the the
 
07:09:36.230 --> 07:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
memb speak some people are opposed to
 
07:09:38.990 --> 07:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
being in class B felony and some members
 
07:09:41.868 --> 07:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sliding scale and then some
 
07:09:44.510 --> 07:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
members want wanted to
 
07:09:47.270 --> 07:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
include more than just dogs so although
 
07:09:48.990 --> 07:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
there's some opposition to the motion as
 
07:09:51.910 --> 07:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
written I don't think the opposition are
 
07:09:54.150 --> 07:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
all on the same page that's just what I
 
07:09:59.590 --> 07:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
GA they so and I will just say that in I
 
07:10:02.350 --> 07:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
am the representative that has tried to
 
07:10:05.150 --> 07:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
go read House Bill 174 so you see where
 
07:10:07.430 --> 07:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
I try to make house pets on the same
 
07:10:10.750 --> 07:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
playing field on equal level so I agree
 
07:10:12.628 --> 07:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
with repres represented Knight's
 
07:10:15.350 --> 07:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
statement I will my concern with doing
 
07:10:17.750 --> 07:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
that is I don't want this bill to fail
 
07:10:20.670 --> 07:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
on its merits if you want to add a cat
 
07:10:20.680 --> 07:10:22.150 align:start position:0%
on its merits if you want to add a cat
or

07:10:22.150 --> 07:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:10:25.948 --> 07:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
whatever so I would say but let that let
 
07:10:28.070 --> 07:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
that uh be ar on its own Mar you don't
 
07:10:31.070 --> 07:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
want to see if you have too
 
07:10:36.948 --> 07:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:39.590 --> 07:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
recognize well I was just going to say
 
07:10:42.270 --> 07:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
anybody who thinks a Glass Colony is too
 
07:10:45.388 --> 07:10:45.398 align:start position:0%
high Char with a Glass Colony it doesn't
 
07:10:47.948 --> 07:10:47.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean you're going to
 
07:10:51.230 --> 07:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
get that's the way it's going to go
 
07:10:56.628 --> 07:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:56.638 --> 07:10:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
people

07:10:58.510 --> 07:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:11:03.030 --> 07:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
de CL B is not in my estimation not too
 
07:11:03.040 --> 07:11:05.190 align:start position:0%
de CL B is not in my estimation not too
high

07:11:05.190 --> 07:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
high
 
07:11:08.150 --> 07:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
a I could
 
07:11:14.708 --> 07:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
goes Testament uh somebody I forget
 
07:11:18.548 --> 07:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
who I think it was B representating bour
 
07:11:20.310 --> 07:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
said is there a way to make it just a
 
07:11:22.230 --> 07:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
felony and then
 
07:11:26.948 --> 07:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
and uh you know you decide what the pet
 
07:11:30.270 --> 07:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
pet or working dog was
 
07:11:34.708 --> 07:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:36.990 --> 07:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
outon I mean that that sounded to me to
 
07:11:37.000 --> 07:11:37.788 align:start position:0%
outon I mean that that sounded to me to
be

07:11:37.788 --> 07:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:11:40.468 --> 07:11:40.478 align:start position:0%
a an excellent solution because I'm not
 
07:11:43.388 --> 07:11:43.398 align:start position:0%
sure Class B is strong enough and I
 
07:11:45.110 --> 07:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't like making it a misdemeanor
 
07:11:47.190 --> 07:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
because nobody's police aren't going to
 
07:11:48.230 --> 07:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
mess with
 
07:11:50.708 --> 07:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
that you got to make a felony to get
 
07:11:52.590 --> 07:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
their attention
 
07:11:55.070 --> 07:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
so they'll have to make a decision on
 
07:11:59.190 --> 07:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
what kind of what level of f it
 
07:12:02.110 --> 07:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
is so I'd like to see somebody withdraw
 
07:12:06.150 --> 07:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
this and we put we put a uh amendment in
 
07:12:10.708 --> 07:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:13.548 --> 07:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
it if if that were the case would you be
 
07:12:16.628 --> 07:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
goes I would
 
07:12:24.670 --> 07:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
yes Rober thank you Mr chair uh again
 
07:12:26.230 --> 07:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know hell freezing over isn't
 
07:12:29.590 --> 07:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad thing
 
07:12:33.310 --> 07:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
um the problem is we don't like again
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
was said we don't have enough
 
07:12:37.468 --> 07:12:37.478 align:start position:0%
information like in other words an
 
07:12:39.548 --> 07:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
18-year-old kid steals a dog because
 
07:12:42.070 --> 07:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
he's drunk now he's convicted of a
 
07:12:44.750 --> 07:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
felony can't get a freaking job he can't
 
07:12:47.270 --> 07:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
own a a gun for the rest of his life
 
07:12:49.110 --> 07:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
can't defend himself for the rest of his
 
07:12:51.670 --> 07:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
life because he was drunk one night
 
07:12:54.990 --> 07:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
versus what the real issue is which is
 
07:12:57.350 --> 07:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
people who are repeat offenders who are
 
07:13:00.548 --> 07:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
stealing dogs for profit so we're not
 
07:13:02.670 --> 07:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
separating out the people that are
 
07:13:04.510 --> 07:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
really the the target of this
 
07:13:06.628 --> 07:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
legislation from the people who might
 
07:13:10.430 --> 07:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
just do something stupid once so I I I
 
07:13:13.388 --> 07:13:13.398 align:start position:0%
can't support it unless we we have more
 
07:13:15.868 --> 07:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
information as to why aren't people
 
07:13:17.708 --> 07:13:17.718 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted now that it's a
 
07:13:20.990 --> 07:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if nobody's being prosecuted
 
07:13:22.310 --> 07:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
why is all of a sudden making it a
 
07:13:24.830 --> 07:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
felony mean that they are prosecuted
 
07:13:27.388 --> 07:13:27.398 align:start position:0%
there there seems like there's something
 
07:13:30.150 --> 07:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
wrong with the system because somebody
 
07:13:32.150 --> 07:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
who steals a dog that they spent six
 
07:13:34.350 --> 07:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
months in Valley Street for it they're
 
07:13:37.030 --> 07:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
probably not going to do it again it's
 
07:13:39.030 --> 07:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
not like they're doing drugs and they're
 
07:13:42.030 --> 07:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
in compelled to do it again it's
 
07:13:43.788 --> 07:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
something they're doing for uh to make a
 
07:13:46.310 --> 07:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
few bars I don't
 
07:13:49.868 --> 07:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
know I I'm for itl unless it's
 
07:13:52.468 --> 07:13:52.478 align:start position:0%
amended what do you I guess the question
 
07:13:54.750 --> 07:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
if I may ask what would you wish to
 
07:13:57.830 --> 07:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
amend the the charge too misdemeanor I I
 
07:14:01.110 --> 07:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
would think the first the uh first one
 
07:14:03.708 --> 07:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
would be a misdemeanor and the second
 
07:14:05.910 --> 07:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
offense would start being a felony
 
07:14:07.750 --> 07:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
because the first time they're
 
07:14:10.030 --> 07:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuted uh for the dog they're going
 
07:14:11.948 --> 07:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
to say look if you get caught
 
07:14:14.708 --> 07:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
again you're going to lose a lot this is
 
07:14:17.788 --> 07:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
It's it gets real serious after this so
 
07:14:19.868 --> 07:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
it gives somebody
 
07:14:22.270 --> 07:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
some anyway plus you're probably going
 
07:14:35.070 --> 07:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:38.350 --> 07:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
anyway representative B thank you Mr
 
07:14:38.360 --> 07:14:39.788 align:start position:0%
anyway representative B thank you Mr
chairman

07:14:39.788 --> 07:14:39.798 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
07:14:43.190 --> 07:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
um representative Klein knight uh
 
07:14:45.510 --> 07:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned several things that refreshed
 
07:14:47.150 --> 07:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
my memory that I wanted to bring up and
 
07:14:49.430 --> 07:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
she's exactly you know
 
07:14:53.270 --> 07:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
right we heard heard some you know
 
07:14:56.350 --> 07:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
testimony from experts and when they
 
07:15:01.070 --> 07:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
were asked for data oh well yeah we'll
 
07:15:03.430 --> 07:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
Circle back around and and get you
 
07:15:06.670 --> 07:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the data um you
 
07:15:08.788 --> 07:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
know that kind of threw me for a loop
 
07:15:11.150 --> 07:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
too and I I forgot until representative
 
07:15:14.510 --> 07:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
Knight mentioned that you know if you
 
07:15:15.990 --> 07:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
come to a hearing you should bring the
 
07:15:17.788 --> 07:15:17.798 align:start position:0%
data that's probably going to be asked
 
07:15:22.110 --> 07:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
and if this is a national problem
 
07:15:24.190 --> 07:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
I would think there'd be plenty of data
 
07:15:26.590 --> 07:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
and nobody had any so you know again
 
07:15:28.510 --> 07:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's another reason but you know and
 
07:15:29.948 --> 07:15:29.958 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to do the amendment I
 
07:15:32.070 --> 07:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
support what Gary's
 
07:15:35.590 --> 07:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative Hopper said and why don't
 
07:15:37.750 --> 07:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
we add all animals you know why do we
 
07:15:41.310 --> 07:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
have to discriminate against a cute cat
 
07:15:44.150 --> 07:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
or you know a Barret or any other animal
 
07:15:45.548 --> 07:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
that could cost a lot of money I don't
 
07:15:48.388 --> 07:15:48.398 align:start position:0%
know how much those things cost but you
 
07:15:51.150 --> 07:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
know why are we discriminating against
 
07:15:51.160 --> 07:15:52.430 align:start position:0%
know why are we discriminating against
other

07:15:52.430 --> 07:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:15:52.440 --> 07:15:56.190 align:start position:0%
other
animals

07:15:56.190 --> 07:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:59.110 --> 07:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um
 
07:16:01.230 --> 07:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's only a suggestion but I with all
 
07:16:02.628 --> 07:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
these questions I would suggest that
 
07:16:05.510 --> 07:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
maybe if we can take back the emotion
 
07:16:07.948 --> 07:16:07.958 align:start position:0%
and maybe have a subcommittee with all
 
07:16:10.230 --> 07:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
the Reps that have uh some problems with
 
07:16:12.948 --> 07:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
this and come back with a uh a good
 
07:16:16.230 --> 07:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment probably be in order I I I
 
07:16:18.350 --> 07:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
will tell you that a subcommittee is a
 
07:16:21.910 --> 07:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
tall order just at these during these
 
07:16:24.388 --> 07:16:24.398 align:start position:0%
troubling times
 
07:16:27.310 --> 07:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the issue I I'm listening to
 
07:16:28.868 --> 07:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
them people talk about the amendment I'm
 
07:16:28.878 --> 07:16:29.628 align:start position:0%
them people talk about the amendment I'm
willing

07:16:29.628 --> 07:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
willing
 
07:16:32.990 --> 07:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
to uh allow representative to withdraw
 
07:16:35.350 --> 07:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
his motion I'm just but I guess my
 
07:16:36.750 --> 07:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
concern is it sounds like different
 
07:16:38.388 --> 07:16:38.398 align:start position:0%
people on different amendments we only
 
07:16:40.388 --> 07:16:40.398 align:start position:0%
put one Amendment forward and those
 
07:16:43.388 --> 07:16:43.398 align:start position:0%
amendments that they want to put in they
 
07:16:46.190 --> 07:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
can't coexist some people want represent
 
07:16:47.990 --> 07:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
testman wants to make it a higher
 
07:16:50.030 --> 07:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
penalty representative Haw wants to make
 
07:16:52.788 --> 07:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
it a lower pen the you're have competing
 
07:16:54.788 --> 07:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
amendments I feel like the middle ground
 
07:16:57.350 --> 07:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
of that is what we have before us which
 
07:16:58.910 --> 07:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
we have this bill last year and that's
 
07:17:01.190 --> 07:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
why it was the class tell it was the
 
07:17:03.628 --> 07:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
competing AR that's in respect of both
 
07:17:06.548 --> 07:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
represent C's ARG and repres hoer AR the
 
07:17:09.548 --> 07:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
middle ground is making it a Class B and
 
07:17:10.990 --> 07:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's what was passing this committee
 
07:17:11.000 --> 07:17:19.590 align:start position:0%
that's what was passing this committee
last

07:17:19.590 --> 07:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:22.110 --> 07:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
year could you make an amendment that
 
07:17:25.070 --> 07:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
said first offense
 
07:17:30.270 --> 07:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:32.670 --> 07:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
felonies the amendment can say what it
 
07:17:34.350 --> 07:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
wants I'm just telling you that a p
 
07:17:37.270 --> 07:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
bread dog cost $3,000 why know and if
 
07:17:40.110 --> 07:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
you stole 300 he stole
 
07:17:42.708 --> 07:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
$2,000 you're GNA get a class get a
 
07:17:45.388 --> 07:17:45.398 align:start position:0%
felony charge wife so we're making
 
07:17:47.948 --> 07:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
exceptions for an animal for some reason
 
07:17:49.868 --> 07:17:49.878 align:start position:0%
which is property any other property
 
07:17:52.948 --> 07:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
would not how about an equal plan I'm
 
07:17:54.350 --> 07:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
just surprised we want to make it such a
 
07:17:57.270 --> 07:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
light P worried about
