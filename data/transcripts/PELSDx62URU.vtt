00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to be here so I sincerely
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank the vice chairman
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative Cloutier for opening and
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
recessing I'm going to change the order
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
of where we're going to go I'd like to
 
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
start with um Senate bill
 
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.029 align:start position:0%
start with um Senate bill
[Music]

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.289 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:27.470 align:start position:0%
um
to

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
228

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
228
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
yeah the Hilton ramp
 
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:37.220 align:start position:0%
and I believe that um the members
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee members have an amendment that
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh started out as representative Eaton
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
on on this matter
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I will bring you up to discussions
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
I've had
 
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and or directors
 
00:26:59.289 --> 00:26:59.299 align:start position:0%
I spoke with the peas Authority
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
about this and making sure that there
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
was a willingness to be a part of this
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
study and if they were in agreement if
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh not only to be a part of it but
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
possibly to help facilitate part of it
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
and they were
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
I spoke to the director from Fish and
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
Game and he told me of the initial
 
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:24.860 align:start position:0%
hesitance in the beginning
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
of taking
 
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:31.220 align:start position:0%
um taking the project on and some of the
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions that might come from that
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
in that they might have to enforce
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
people parking and going in and out of
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
the water and then there was a question
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
of whether commercial
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
fishermen could use that ramp also so
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
they welcomed the idea of
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
working through a study with DOT them
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
and P's authority to make sure that they
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
could work that out and they were they
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
were more than happy then to engage in
 
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:10.100 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
we have heard for a number of years
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
about the uh commercial oyster operation
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
that is started in that bay I I for some
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
reason thought that was happening
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but there's a lot of activity
 
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.010 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but there's a lot of activity
there

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:24.020 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.570 align:start position:0%
there
and

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:25.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
we have been
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
supportive of monitoring
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
quality of the water and so forth for
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
that purpose so I believe that makes
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
sense so
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
um with my ramblings
 
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.140 align:start position:0%
I would like to open it up for any
 
00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes uh I would like to make a motion to
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass on representative's
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you motion made and seconded by uh
 
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.130 align:start position:0%
thank you motion made and seconded by uh
vallone

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
vallone
 
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.029 align:start position:0%
vallone
um

00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
hearing yes representative staffy
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
I just read the two but I can't see the
 
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.810 align:start position:0%
I just read the two but I can't see the
difference

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative do you have uh okay um I
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
just I I strongly support this amendment
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
I think representative Eaton did a
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
fantastic job drafting I'm just sorry
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
he's not able to be here today but he
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
had a more important engagement I think
 
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:48.620 align:start position:0%
it really clears up a lot of everything
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I think it will make the the study a
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
lot easier and it does have a date in
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
there June 30th so the study will be
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
completed we'll take it up I mean the
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
report will be issued my guess is it's
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
probably we will have to take it up as
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
maybe in a capital appropriation in the
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
next capital budget if I had to guess
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
but it's a start anyway and I applaud
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment I'm in strong support of
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I think the member's
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
question was about why we have two
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
copies of the same Amendment they are
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
identical yeah okay there was a mistake
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
sorry about that but that's uh two
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
copies just in case
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
and the confusion of that so you're
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the exact same
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative and I had asked
 
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
our assistant to uh to print a copy and
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
there was already a copy out here so I'm
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
afraid that's why you see two of the
 
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.269 align:start position:0%
afraid that's why you see two of the
same

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
and I believe the difference there there
 
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of definition of who was
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
going to be in the committee and how it
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
was to proceed and representative Beaton
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
had spent some time going and back and
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
forth uh between the sponsors and and
 
00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
trying to get some accountability yes
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative I think one of the other
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
things that's been corrected is the
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
analysis that used to refer to
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
building a boat ramp and I now correctly
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
refers to the study I think as a another
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
thing that changed since the last time
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
we saw this and I do appreciate your
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
attention to detail thank you sir
 
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
further yes yes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
um one of the main differences I saw
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
from the original bill
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
page 11 of the original bill that said
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
representatives of the aquaculture
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
industry that's been taken out
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
of the new Amendment that's the basic
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
change I saw the question I had is I I
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
thought we heard a testimony saying that
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
the fishing game was saying no way that
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
the study should be could be completed
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
by June 30th 2024. has that been changed
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newton the when
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
I spoke when I spoke to the director
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
last week from Fish and Game
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
um he said that
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
um he and his Department had thoroughly

01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:02.579 align:start position:0%
I was presented a amendment by Senator
 
01:07:02.579 --> 01:07:04.670 align:start position:0%
I was presented a amendment by Senator
Perkins

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
Perkins
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
a change to a change to this
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 258 it's highly unusual the
 
01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.370 align:start position:0%
Bill 258 it's highly unusual the
um

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.349 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment would need to come from this
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee from the house
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
um if anyone wants to discuss the
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
amendment by the senator we're happy to
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
do that as discussion but at this point
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
in time I'm not planning on bringing
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
that forward
 
01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
so it would take us back to the original
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
the bill uh 258 as presented
 
01:07:48.119 --> 01:07:50.750 align:start position:0%
the bill uh 258 as presented
and

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:53.660 align:start position:0%
I would um
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
I recognize the vice chairman okay just
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%

01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
proposal meant by Senator Perkins if we
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
decided for some reason we liked this
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
amount we would have to have it
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
redrafted or rep or you know uh would
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
either yourself or somebody else you
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
would have to go to the OLS and have it
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
redrafted as a house and then is that
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
correct that that is my understanding
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Jack did you want you
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
just made mention of that I confirmed
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
that with the with the house clerk
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday thank you for that
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
so I will is there any further
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
discussion on the Senate Amendment yes
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner
 
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner
I

01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
I'm actually in favor of the bill as
 
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
originally presented but I understand
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
amendment is designed to address some of
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
the concerns that they heard
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
in our hearing
 
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this is a
 
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
a reasonable way to proceed with this
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
and one which is likely to be acceptable
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
on the other side
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
if we pass it this way and I think that
 
01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:04.249 align:start position:0%
if we pass it this way and I think that
it

01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do what the original bill
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
had hoped to do in terms of
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the price of the of the real estate
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
but I think it does
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
allow us to preserve historic properties
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
with the uh with an agency that in fact
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
has some expertise in some
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
to appreciate the historic nature of
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
some of these properties that are in dot
 
01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.510 align:start position:0%
some of these properties that are in dot
uh

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
possession of the present time so I I
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
think that we should consider this
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh or the wording of this
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
amendment perhaps as it's renumbered as
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
a house Amendment and would be happy to
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
to move to to approve that at the time
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
so so if I unders if I understand
 
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.150 align:start position:0%
so so if I unders if I understand
um

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
are are you suggesting representative
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
that you are willing to have this
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
drafted as as because we we can't
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
discuss it because it's it's not a house
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
if I understand representative Jack that
 
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
we can't discuss this because it's not a
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
house Amendment are you saying that you
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
want to go and have it drafted as a
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
house Amendment we recess again or would
 
01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:32.420 align:start position:0%
you rather move to the
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
not do that and then move to the
 
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
so the mechanism of whether we do that
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
postpone her the next time we could we
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
could meet
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
or whether we retain this and deal with
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
it in in the fall
 
01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.750 align:start position:0%
it in in the fall
um

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
all of those things that could work I I
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
to Ita itl was built this time and they
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
would not support that I think
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
I mean the the issues that I think this
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
addresses and people were concerned
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
about selling any property at less than
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
market value
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's off the table with this amendment
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about
 
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about
uh

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
about whether it was clear that we were
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to follow the same process
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
with the long-range planning and and
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
capital uh Capital programming committee
 
01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's that's clarified in this
 
01:11:37.739 --> 01:11:39.169 align:start position:0%
that's that's clarified in this
amendment

01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:11:39.179 --> 01:11:42.649 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
and so I mean I think that this was a
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
reasonable attempt to address the
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that we raised and I'm not
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
quite sure why
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't at least consider that
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
carefully because uh I think it was a
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
to meet us halfway
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
and addressing the concerns that we
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
raised uh I think through the
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Jack uh thank
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh Nothing Stops us from
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment uh the thing
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't do is adopt it as the
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment and then report the
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
bill as otpa with an s-numbered
 
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.250 align:start position:0%
bill as otpa with an s-numbered
amendment

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:21.260 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
we can't do that today but we could do
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
well it is possible that we could we
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
could check with
 
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
could check with
um

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
with OLS on this and we could have an
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
amendment out today
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
maybe this morning
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I would I would rather conclude our
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
business for the committee today
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
and if if you're serious that this
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
amendment is something that you would
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
um to vote on then we could do that
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
but I would like to wrap up our
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
committee's business today
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
represent Cloutier uh yes I have a
 
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman if for now we maybe
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
we could postpone discussion on the
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and get back to the main bill
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
believe this is in Newington and
 
01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.169 align:start position:0%
believe this is in Newington and
basically

01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:15:15.179 --> 01:15:16.430 align:start position:0%
basically
uh

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
this property right now I believe is
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
owned by due to have been owned for
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
several days I've heard 70 years and I'm
 
01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.330 align:start position:0%
several days I've heard 70 years and I'm
wondering

01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
are there any plans by D.O.T to do
 
01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:30.620 align:start position:0%
anything with it uh or I don't know even
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
if if I may miss share any plans to sell
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
it give whatever but I just was curious
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
what the future holds for this property
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
in regard especially in regards to Dot
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
and I I will first certify that I may
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
not be the best person to answer this
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
this question but my understanding is
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
the intent was to use this property uh
 
01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:55.699 align:start position:0%
as mitigation
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
for the loss of the general Sullivan
 
01:15:58.739 --> 01:16:01.669 align:start position:0%
for the loss of the general Sullivan
Bridge

01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so there's no
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
there's no plans right now to do
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
anything else right it's more for
 
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.510 align:start position:0%
anything else right it's more for
mitigation

01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard of anything other than
 
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.209 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard of anything other than
that

01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Robot Dave thank you
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
if I could while I have you there sir
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding and
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
conversations that D.O.T during the
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
mitigation process had talked about a
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
sum of money uh to return this property
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
back to a better condition and my
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
understanding was that part of that
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
mitigation or part of that process was
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
some number in the area of a hundred
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars do you know anything
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
about that sir
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
I don't have great details on that but I
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
have heard a similar number being tossed
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
around them that we would contribute to
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
the preservation of the building so it's
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the stage intends
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
to preserve the building and was hoping
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
then that the ownership after it had and
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
I may be simplifying this
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
then the Hope was after that that then
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
the property could then be turned over
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
to the town which could turn it to the
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh which could then turn it to the
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
Historical Society to manage or to own
 
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
from that time forward but as we heard
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
in testimony for those that weren't here
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
that there was a disconnect when it when
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
time came where there was a Changing of
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
the Guard of the government or whatever
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
for the town they decided they didn't
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
um the general Sullivan bridge for for
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee members that were not here
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
at least a couple terms ago
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the determination had been made
 
01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:48.659 align:start position:0%
early on that the department was going
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
to either a save the structure and turn
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
it into a pedestrian Bikeway but then
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
discovered a later time that uh the
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
structure was failing to a point that
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
that didn't make sense
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
then they talked about building some new
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
structure for that purpose using the
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
pylons if that's the right term that
 
01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:14.060 align:start position:0%
contains some historical significance
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
for millions of dollars to resemble in
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
some way
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
the old General Sullivan Bridge did not
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
meet favor with this committee and it
 
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
was a recommendation and a 10-year plan
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
to remove the superstructure so
 
01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.649 align:start position:0%
to remove the superstructure so
unfortunately

01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
in the Chairman's opinion
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
this building has become upon
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt by legislation to
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
to have the town take it and that fell
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
through and my concern to Tinker with
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation as it is is not the
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
best use of time right now and that if
 
01:19:04.689 --> 01:19:04.699 align:start position:0%
it was if this bill was to be removed
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
then it would allow members on this
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
committee possibly to work with DOT
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
would allow the Historical Society to
 
01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:18.620 align:start position:0%
work with Dot and find another solution
 
01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:21.980 align:start position:0%
that would work both for the town
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
and Dot so
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
um if the if the committee has further
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
questions of this gentleman I will take
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
it and if we don't we will go back to
 
01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.350 align:start position:0%
it and if we don't we will go back to
discussion

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:43.570 align:start position:0%
Mr Labonte for giving this qualification
 
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:44.990 align:start position:0%
Mr Labonte for giving this qualification
[Music]

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the reason I wanted to ask the
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
question was I'd ask that other
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives when we were discussing
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
this bill before and it has to do with
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
the reversion
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
um that in fact there was a standard way
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
within the dot that if in fact you did
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
let's say sell it somehow or give it
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
whatever to uh
 
01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the non-profit that if if
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
they fail for some some ways that there
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
was the the means just to take it back
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
state would just get it back without any
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
consideration of any money they put into
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
it or anything it would just revert back
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
to the state is something like that
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct if if so for
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
instance if we were selling a Wetlands
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
mitigation area saying we had 15 we
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
saved one of our projects impacted 15
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
Acres of wetlands so we were had an
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
obligation to preserve 15 Acres of
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
wetlands somewhere else
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
the idea would be that we would
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
seek to find a conservation group
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
that would take the property
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
heavily burdened with restrictions and a
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
conservation easement and a reverter
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
clause how the reverter Clause works if
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
the property ever falls out of the use
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
it was intended for title automatically
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
reverts back to the state no
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
compensation and as as we spoke before
 
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
this meeting uh it's it's Unique in that
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh under state law reverta Clauses for
 
01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:27.380 align:start position:0%
for most parties except
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
non-profits and governmental entities it
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's illegal but there is an exception
 
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
for governmental entities and
 
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.430 align:start position:0%
for governmental entities and
non-profits

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
further questions I don't thank you
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
further questions from D.O.T
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
okay yes please thank you thank you Mr
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
chairman no representative Mrs Lamonte
 
01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:53.709 align:start position:0%
chairman no representative Mrs Lamonte
had

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:53.719 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
is your understanding that the dot and
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
historical have there been any
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
conversations between
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
yourselves and the Newington Personnel
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
who wish to preserve the property and
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
bring it to uh it's maybe its original
 
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:12.169 align:start position:0%
bring it to uh it's maybe its original
state

01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
and go ahead
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding there has been
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
considerable conversation between uh
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
the historical society and
 
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.229 align:start position:0%
the historical society and
um

01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%

01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
manager I haven't had that many except
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
here today but
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
I believe there have been yes okay thank
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
you and quick follow-up yes please this
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
was mention of a hundred thousand
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
dollars possibly uh is is that budge is
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
that budgeted is that set aside those
 
01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
funds and I'm not privy to that
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
information I don't know if that's been
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
that there's a source for that fund at
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
this time or not okay thank you I just
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
one further question
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
to the building itself in the land that
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
it sits on or is it the building itself
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
it is a is the proposal for the
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
Historical Society if if this
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
legislation were to pass you have a
 
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
building that's down there
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
and is it the footprint of just what's
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
around that and and maybe access in and
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
out because it would seem to me
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
that the state is still going to retain
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
the larger parcel which I refer to as
 
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
so my understanding and I I again I
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
always was under the impression that we
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
were going to convey bloody point
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the building so I don't believe it
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
was just the footprint it was the entire
 
01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
was just the footprint it was the entire
point

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your time thank
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr Levante appreciate it thank you
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.689 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
okay

01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so we have a motion of I of itl
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and it has been second and I'm open
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes represent villain
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
um at this point I'm still a little
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
reluctant to vote itl although I see the
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
logic behind it I'm much more
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a retain uh simply
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
because I think with the retain there's
 
01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.550 align:start position:0%
because I think with the retain there's
still

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
then itl pretty much there's no the
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
pressure on uh the parties to act I
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
think is less that's all with the retain
 
01:24:54.649 --> 01:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
there is this notion that if something
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
happens then perhaps we don't need to do
 
01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
anything later on but if nothing happens
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
then maybe then we should reconsider the
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill so that's my I'm just expressing my
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
my thinking at the time uh and again I
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
know you folks have a lot more
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
experience on issues like this but
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm okay thank you all
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
we'll support itl either I would
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
be willing to accept the retention as
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
just a reminder this is not just about
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
this one one property this is a change
 
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the procedure that affects
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
other similar situations that may occur
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I know that's occurred in the past
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it's not just this I mean
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is what motivated this particular
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill at this time
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
but here's an opportunity to
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
create a procedure whereby we can get
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
some public benefit out of these excess
 
01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
properties in a way that takes it off
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
the out of the responsibility of dot
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
that I think we've heard that
 
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability or the um
 
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
or the responsibility to
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know to do historic preservation or
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
to maintain Parks or other other things
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
that other
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
other agencies or other uh
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
that the groups might be able to do
 
01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.430 align:start position:0%
that the groups might be able to do
better

01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
um I just think that this is an
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we have now and that
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's a shame to
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
um kill it based upon one
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
project that we have in front of us now
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank thank you representative Faulkner
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newton yes um I do
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
agree that this bill is not site
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
specific and we keep referring to that
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's so many unknowns here
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
that um I think we ought to itl because
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many pieces of
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
property it's going to affect
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
um any details with what this bill is
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to do and what they people are
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do with the property
 
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
and a lot of property that the state
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
gets from dot is by eminent domain and
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
how does that matter when they go to
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
dispose of it when they've got it by
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
eminent domain so until a either if
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with a specific piece
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
of property maybe somebody should bring
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
a bill forward dealing with just that
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
specific piece of property and make it
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
site specific or before this bill is
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
ready to go anywhere there's so much
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
information that has to be received and
 
01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
and studied I would strongly recommend
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
we it almost Bill okay thank you
 
01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:34.689 align:start position:0%
we it almost Bill okay thank you
um

01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:34.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
please know back and forth and I know
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
you sir go ahead
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a new Point brought up I mean
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
our job as a legislature is to set up
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
procedures that protect the public
 
01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
interest or further the public interest
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know we leave the details of you
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
know exactly which what happens and what
 
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.390 align:start position:0%
know exactly which what happens and what
properties

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh to the to the agencies and um you
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
know the procedure here that has checks
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
and balances we have
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know governor and executive Council
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee on I keep getting the
 
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
name wrong
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
long-range planning long-range Capital
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
planning and utilization committee
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
so those are the those are the steps
 
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
that we have placed
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know in this process now
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
for disposition of property we rely on
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
the agencies to
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
follow that process and justify
 
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
you know individual projects on an
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
individual basis so I think we've
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
retained that and I would be comfortable
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
with that as it is thank you any further
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
discussion yes please represent thank
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
you chairman uh jurors
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand for the
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that was uh we received last
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
month and that hot
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
early uh early summertime day that
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
the preservation and historical group
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
has put a lot of effort and uh Sweat
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
Equity into this into this matter a lot
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
of lobbying a lot of advocating uh and
 
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.510 align:start position:0%
of lobbying a lot of advocating uh and
it's

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
creating a mechanism to
 
01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh help reduce the inventory of other
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
historical sites uh that the that the
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
dot has in their inventory I think is is
 
01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
an important uh
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
is something important that it should be
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
taken up
 
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:24.540 align:start position:0%

on if we can take that up the Senate
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment today or that'll discuss it
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%

01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted to be because I'm
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
members are talking about it
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
the I spoke to the um that is on the um
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill what's the number on that
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
it's uh House Bill 296. 296 that went to
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Senate and was amended uh has been
 
01:32:38.649 --> 01:32:38.659 align:start position:0%
brought back and I had conversations
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
this morning with the uh Prime sponsor
 
01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.390 align:start position:0%
this morning with the uh Prime sponsor
and

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
um he is still up in the air whether
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
that makes sense I know that it's going
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
to be our committee bill but I was
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
looking to see where the prime sponsor
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
felt on that and we'll discuss that
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
amongst the committee I don't think we
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
have to have a formal meeting to do that
 
01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe it'll be brought in
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
um Thursday okay and that as well as the
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to the capital budget right I
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
mean we discussed that we'll discuss
 
01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
that later the um on the amendment to
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
the capital budget I think you all have
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
seen that there was a there was a
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
correction or two made on it which was I
 
01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
believe one was a lapse funding movement
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and one was to change
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
the purchase of the building down here
 
01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:34.430 align:start position:0%
the purchase of the building down here
from

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
from if my understanding is correct from
 
01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:38.709 align:start position:0%
from if my understanding is correct from
being

01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
overseen by the Department of Education
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
was then changed to be overseen by uh
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
Public Works
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
our public works department
 
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
and both the um
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and Public
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
Works was in favor of that
 
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
so my my having attended many of it the
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
vice chairman some other members were
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
there from time to time
 
01:34:09.129 --> 01:34:09.139 align:start position:0%
they took our bill and accepted
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
99.9 percent 99 of everything we
 
01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
submitted and repeatedly thanked the
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee for the hard work so it made
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
their job much easier so
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
I don't and if anyone wants to discuss
 
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
that but I don't I don't see a reason
 
01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't concur with that bill
 
01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:32.510 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't concur with that bill
also

01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
