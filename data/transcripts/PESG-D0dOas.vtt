00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
welcome to edna
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
let's see we will be executing a number
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
of bills after we complete the public
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1321. i call the
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative horrigan if you're
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
going to give us testimony which i very
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
much appreciated i would also appreciate
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
you're not reading it to us
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
every member of this committee has
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
well thank you i'll try to make it
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat extemporaneous um
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully i won't digress too much
 
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.230 align:start position:0%
hopefully i won't digress too much
actually

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
that will enable me to skip ahead to
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
skip ahead till the end which is the
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
second section of the bill is which will
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
look very very similar to you because
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's the same as hb 1037 which you
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
amended and improved and i think it's
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
already reports already been filed and
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your work on it
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
the one this is probably somewhat
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
duplicative the way i did it but i ols
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
when i consult with ols i figured the
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
part that's section two would be more
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
less controversial than what's in
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
section one and uh so they
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
we ended up sending two bills down and
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
nobody stopped me the speaker's office
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
didn't stop me whoever else is
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
responsible so that's why i had two
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
bills and
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
i'd assumed at the time that we'd
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
probably have the hearing it on the same
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's why so
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're basically rolling back
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
um well really back to changes to rsa
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
445 subpar uh roman numeral one and two
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
so they're in uh section 91 459 of the
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill and then um they're
 
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:44.150 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill and then um they're
also

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
basically that part of the rsas and they
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
had two sections um of the house version
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
of the budget trailer bill
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
which were then dealing with the
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
emergency powers uh governance emergency
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
powers issues and then the senate took
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
those out and then they
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
had a very different version
 
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.310 align:start position:0%
had a very different version
[Music]

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
was put back in during the conference
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee so the language that's in uh
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
that was sections 459 and 460 of the
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
um budget trailer bill were never
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
never let never had a hearing because
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know it was uh introduced put in at
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
the last moment during the conference
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
committee and that's uh
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
and that's the way that's the way things
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
happen with a lot of issues that's not
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
nothing terribly nefarious about it but
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
but i disagreed with at least half of
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
what they did so i'm um
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
just restoring rsa 445 roman numeral one
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
and 2 to what was passed into law along
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
with many other emergency management
 
00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:43.269 align:start position:0%
with many other emergency management
provisions

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
20 years ago in 2002 by a broad
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan majority
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
i guess it was a
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
roll call in the house which was
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
something like 238 to 112 but they were
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
across party lines uh both on the gays
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
and nays and that so
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
and it's been um
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
been the same ever since until now so
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
that was they added some stuff to rsa 4
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
then they also created rsa21p and now
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm getting way off into the weeds and
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
that was a reaction at the events of
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
september 11 2001
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i think the law has been passed
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
well as work since then including during
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
well i described here as a 20 21 20 yeah
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
the 2020 and 2021 state of emergency and
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
um there's some i think
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
actually the crisis that led to the
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
estate emergency going on but the uh the
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
governor uh imposed a state of emergency
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
as you all remember all too well back in
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh mid march of 2020 and then he uh
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
continued for 15 months um even and then
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
he rather uh
 
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.269 align:start position:0%
he rather uh
abruptly

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
abruptly
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
didn't renew it in june 2021 but anyway
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
so the pandemic is a different type of
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
crisis from what was envisioned in 2022
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
but i think well 2002 i mean but i think
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
worked well i mean i don't necessarily
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
agree with everything sununu dead fact
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with a lot of it
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
but i actually thought he wasn't tough
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
enough in certain levels certain areas
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
and also other cases he kind of stepped
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit outside the law in certain
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
areas and like he was reacting a crisis
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
and he didn't know what was going on any
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
more than i did or anybody else did so i
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
and there's some there's some
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
questionable things certainly he shut
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature totally out of the
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
emergency response process for several
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
months and then when we got back in he
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
kind of we kind of set up our own
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body but um the law
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
the but the bill the budget trailer bill
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
did a little stuff
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative horrigan you're
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
rambling oh sorry well that was
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
i know well i'm trying not to read it
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
verbatim so
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
anyway the changes did very little
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
address that issue and i think the
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
process that eventually passed by the
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
conference committee is cumbersome and
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work it certainly would not
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
have worked two years ago which was uh
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
we'd be forced to meet every 90 days in
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
joint session along with the senate
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
to renew the state of emergency um even
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a bipartisan consensus that
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
the emergency state of emergency should
 
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.230 align:start position:0%
the emergency state of emergency should
continue

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
and even it's not necessarily possible
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
for us to meet and presumably be in
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
person and that's an even more of a
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
difficulty uh
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the house did meet
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
at the whittemore center arena in 2020
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
as those of you here remember vividly
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
but that was about 90 days
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
after the state of emergency was imposed
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
but we can't necessarily count on that
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
happening the next time something
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
similar happens to the state of new
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm sure
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
someday it will so
 
00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
someday it will so
um

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
anyway so i just thought so that even
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
though like so i thought the old law was
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
just permits us to meet if we just feel
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
like the governor is wrong in the state
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
because existing law does allow us to uh
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
call it call ourselves a joint
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
convention and terminate the state of
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
emergency if that's what there's a
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
consensus to do and if it's possible for
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
us to meet a joint convention i think
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
that was uh better than
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
better than what we had so i urge you to
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:10.150 align:start position:0%
better than what we had so i urge you to
uh

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
pass this bill um since half of it
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
you've already passed and reported you'd
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's obviously you'd have to deal
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
with that some way probably my
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
simplest solution probably would simply
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
to take the amended language that you've
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
already passed and then paste it into
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
this bill so that's um
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that's basically uh that's basically
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
my proposal i'm just i think what we did
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
in 2002 is better than what's in the
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill at least for the
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
time being and this issue may have to be
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
revisited but it probably should be
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
revisited in a more leisurely and more
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
open fashion than a
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
budget conference committee so that's
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my proposal and i'd be
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you thought there
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
were some things the governor did that
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
might have been inappropriate and so
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
given that
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
um wondering why you chose to remove the
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
legislature's ability
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
to uh repeal individual emergency orders
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
which is in uh current statute after uh
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
you know our last year well my belief is
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i looked at the
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
old stature that we already had that
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
power it was just
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
it was optional so we
 
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
it was optional so we
felt

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
felt
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
if we felt that we should meet in joint
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
convention we could still call ourselves
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
in the joint convention but this would
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
make us do so even if um
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
even if there was a
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
even if they're even uh if even if the
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
consensus was to continue the state of
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
emergencies obviously so there already
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
is a provision in there i believe for
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
the house to uh house and senate to come
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
together and follow up sure
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
um you might want to look at it because
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
i as i understand it and you know maybe
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
you can correct me um
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
we could meet and end the entire state
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
of emergency but we did not have the
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
authority to uh terminate individual
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
emergency orders
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but i'm not sure if i i'm
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
not sure if i agree with that or not but
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh there's that's uh probably
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's probably something that that
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
should be uh should be uh should be
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
considered certainly
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
certainly if we meant it
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
certainly um there are lots of ways we
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
could bring bring pressure on him and i
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
also felt that the governor you know
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
he kind of bypassed uh there's the
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee which uh
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
my opinion should have
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
should have uh
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
done the then should have continued its
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
role and said he set up a uh you know
 
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.430 align:start position:0%
role and said he set up a uh you know
the

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
the gopher i believe it was called uh
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that was that was one of
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
the specific emergency orders that many
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature wished to
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
terminate without terminating the entire
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes emergency yeah the problem i mean
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
there is there's certainly his way if we
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
probably could have uh
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
i think this probably weighs the threat
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
of terminal state of emergency could
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
would probably make uh
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
certain would make the governor uh
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
rethink some of his or her actions in a
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
future emergency so
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan i have
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
two a question for you yes did you
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
consider the language of house bill 417
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
which passed last year on a 328 to 41
 
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
which passed last year on a 328 to 41
vote

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
um oh that was uh
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
i considered it but this is the proposal
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
i i came up with so you can certainly um
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
yes or the house bill 275 which we
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
passed in january
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
well in january this january was this
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
january well this had not passed when i
 
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.750 align:start position:0%
january well this had not passed when i
uh

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.789 align:start position:0%
uh
submitted

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
obviously that would not have passed
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
back in november december when i was uh
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
drafting the bill
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you so thank you for your
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee i'm melissa blasik i represent
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
hillsborough 21 the town of merrimack
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
i am here today to oppose hb 1321 this
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill undoes much of our achievements
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
last year to reform state of emergency
 
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.230 align:start position:0%
last year to reform state of emergency
statute

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 445 was originally passed in 2002 as
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
a response to 911 and was not
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
implemented until the recent covet 19
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
after the law was used we saw room for
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
improvement for future emergencies the
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
changes we made that you see today in
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
existing law are not a reflection in any
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
way upon how the executive branch
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
managed the covet 19 state of emergency
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
they are simply a response to lessons we
 
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.190 align:start position:0%
they are simply a response to lessons we
learned

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
learned
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency reform we
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
achieved last year should not be
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
considered a partisan issue
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
both parties value our constitutional
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
form of government that has created the
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
freest society on earth to quote thomas
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
jefferson the republican is the only
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
form of government which is not
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
eternally at open or secret war with the
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
rights of mankind
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
it therefore follows that we maintain
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
this form of government with its
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
separate branches that create checks and
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
balances upon each other in some fashion
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
even during a state of emergency
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
i find it confusing why anyone would
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
object to the reforms we made last year
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
how is it bad that the legislature can
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
terminate a particular emergency order
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
while maintaining a state of emergency
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't this protect people from
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
potential abuses of authority while
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
allowing their elected representatives
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to do their job and represent the people
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with the government needing
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
to be notified that the legi
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
needing to notify the legislature of an
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
emergency order how is it objectionable
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
to change the termination of the state
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
of emergency to a simple vote instead of
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
a resolution resolutions have
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
limitations as to when they can be
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
introduced so changing this to a simple
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
vote makes more sense
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
calling for this vote after a certain
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
period of time and again allowing the
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%

lack is seconded by rhodes

do you wish to speak to your motion
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
trying to look through my notes we uh
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee met and um dealt with
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
a number of concerns i mean
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
i don't feel strongly one way or another
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
about this but there were concerns that
 
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
about this but there were concerns that
um

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
it might not be the appropriate um you
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
know in the best interest of some
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
employees uh you know depending on
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
whether they have debt or other issues
 
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.470 align:start position:0%
whether they have debt or other issues
um

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
and there were some
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
views expressed that
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
nudge people or influence what they do
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
especially by the government through
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
changing the defaults
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily appropriate
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that people can choose to uh join
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
this if they want and adjust their
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
payment whenever they want so
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
it was viewed as not really uh necessary
 
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.109 align:start position:0%
it was viewed as not really uh necessary
now

00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
executive departments or other other
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
parts executive uh
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
branch feel that there's some value to
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
this i mean they can ask for us to
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
consider doing it again but at this
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
point i recommend itl
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have a whole lot of notes on
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
this particular bill except that it
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
seemed that the general overall
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
consensus of the committee really didn't
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
like it i do remember there were a lot
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
of questions asked and other than that i
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
would pretty much just refer to
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
everything that representative like us
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative mark
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to expand on what
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative lekka says one of the
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
things we pointed out in subcommittee is
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
that this would specifically affect
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
younger employees or this is their first
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
job the intention is to nudge them into
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
saving sooner for their retirement
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
feeling that compounding would get them
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
ahead faster in life that would make
 
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.430 align:start position:0%
ahead faster in life that would make
sense

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
in a lot of instances however in the
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
specific instances which is all too
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
common these days
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
where a new employee has higher interest
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
rate loans particularly student loans
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's far and away in their better
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
interest to first pay off their loans
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
and then start saving for their
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
retirement and therefore we didn't think
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
we should mandate that they
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
automatically be enrolled in this
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
well as a sponsor of this bill i thought
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
that there were enough
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough language there to
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
allow people to adjust the plan
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
to suit their specific circumstances
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
and i think that in the future it should
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.589 align:start position:0%
but i
i

00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
after thinking about it i think that it
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate to be
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the the executive branch say in the
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
governor's budget or in a contract
 
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.150 align:start position:0%
governor's budget or in a contract
negotiation

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
negotiation
and

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
then put into statute rather than being
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
a legislative initiative
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
um i think that's
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
really not so much our uh
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
our responsibility
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um thank you
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair i i definitely agree with
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
with the suggestion that you just made
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly because it gives an
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the state employees the
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
people that we're talking about here to
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
have the input
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
as to what as to how it might work best
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
for them thank you
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
i do think that the fact that none of
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
them wrote us or called
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
or showed up at the hearing indicated
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that they were not violently objecting
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
to it
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
it may not me they may not have had but
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
strong support but there was not violent
 
00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:52.390 align:start position:0%
strong support but there was not violent
objection

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
i did speak with the
 
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.230 align:start position:0%
i did speak with the
sciu

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
sciu
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
before i i brought it in so
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
they they were at least aware of it
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i would just
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
like to say i i
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
am uh involved with deferred comp myself
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i think probably the better way to
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
go would be to
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
find some way to encourage
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
the state to better educate particularly
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
new employees
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
about the benefits of the system
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that can be
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
accomplished but i think that's
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
the thing we should look at
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%

scitec
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
well everybody said every many
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable things but the fact is opt
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
out exists and
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's a personal circumstance
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's whatever reason they can
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
opt out and
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
people need to be more than nudged in my
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
view representative o'brien in his quiet
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
way said how important it was in his own
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
financial life i think representative
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
schuett might have also so i'm
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against itl
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%

companies do
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
but i know that in many cases
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
private companies offer a match
 
00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:25.030 align:start position:0%
private companies offer a match
to

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%

absolutely true and
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
nobody's suggesting the state makes such
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
a match
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
he will be here by noon
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
all right in that case we will hold off
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
in that case i move
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
there are copies on the table and
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
right this is okay
 
00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:54.230 align:start position:0%
right this is okay
um

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.030 align:start position:0%
is there a second
okay

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses the issue
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
that came up at the hearing that the
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
functions of the of the some of the
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
functions of the assessing board
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
were being transferred to a
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
assessor certification board under oplc
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
but it didn't address
 
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.309 align:start position:0%
but it didn't address
the

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
the transition
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
so this amendment simply says
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
that any dra issued certificate
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
is valid until it expires
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that a person coming in with such a
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
certificate will be considered as a
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
renewal rather than a new license
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't have to extend the rules for
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
from dra because
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
they still certified their own employees
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
and municipal assessors
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
so their rules are still still valid
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
invalidated by moving moving the
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative marsha
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes if i could ask a question does this
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
address the concern of the test the
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
person who testified from goffstown that
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be enough assessors to
 
00:47:25.119 --> 00:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be enough assessors to
actually

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
implement the property tax yes
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
it it keeps every currently certified
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
assessor certified
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
for the for the duration of their uh
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
pearson thank you um
 
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
pearson thank you um
and

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
this will this can certainly be
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
revisited when
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
when we look at um
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
the makeup of other boards i i
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
the only the only thing i would have
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
liked to have seen is is uh the
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
since that seems to be something that
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
we're doing other than that i mean a
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
neck and like i said that could be
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
addressed at another time so
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
this definitely takes care of the
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
grandfathering problem and i think that
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
was the overall
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass amendment
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
0519 to house bill 1552
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%

00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
since representative schmidt's not here
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:43.589 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.599 --> 00:49:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll speak to my motion this
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill moves the
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
professional assessors
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
to a new board
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
and moves them out from under the
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
that helps because dra has
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
is not transparent they have
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
most of their actions are exempt from
 
00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.549 align:start position:0%
most of their actions are exempt from
91a

00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
91a
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
they also hire
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
and train assessors so having the the
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
regulation of assessors
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
creates the possibility of a conflict of
 
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.710 align:start position:0%
creates the possibility of a conflict of
interest

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
so i think that this board
 
00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:44.870 align:start position:0%
so i think that this board
is

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
more appropriately
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
associated with the oplc
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative goalie do you wish to
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
speak to you
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh i think it was well said and
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
the order of transparency i think this
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
well i agree of course but i think that
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
it could have been done without uh the
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
whole setup of another board just to
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
make a exemption for
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh disciplinary procedure
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
transparency in the appropriate places
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
in dra as far as the conflict of
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
interest goes i've not ever heard or no
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
instance of that has ever been alleged
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
that i was aware of so i think this is
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'll vote for this but it seems a pretty
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
big contraption that's not necessary
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
questions okay i don't see any
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the motion is ought to pass as
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
amended on house bill 1552 and the clerk
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
can call the roll
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%

an unsullied 18-0
 
00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.589 align:start position:0%
an unsullied 18-0
okay

00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
the motion passes they're in the
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
objection to consent
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
you have a motion on house bill 13-14
 
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.150 align:start position:0%
you have a motion on house bill 13-14
um

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i motioned to itl

yes madam chair i motioned to itl
1314

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%

i'll second it
okay

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
santa

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
um yes i spoke with the veteran groups
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh they were trying to get an amendment
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
in and they were trying to figure out
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with this bill they
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
were not quite happy with the way it is
 
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.589 align:start position:0%
were not quite happy with the way it is
and

00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
they do not have enough time to work on
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
it plus their board the association will
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
be changing to new
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
board of managers are going to undergo
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
significant changes
 
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.109 align:start position:0%
significant changes
starting

00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
starting
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
in march of this year so they're
 
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.950 align:start position:0%
in march of this year so they're
thinking

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
they need more time probably months to
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
work on this so they'll come back with
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
something else next year
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's why you know
 
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
that's why you know
representative

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative santana estacio do we
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
all right is there any further
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
i did speak with the auditing department
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
and there were several audits that were
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
conducted on the veterans home and i
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
will share that link with the committee
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
so that we're well aware of the
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
situation there
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that there are
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly issues with the veterans
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
home but i don't think a study committee
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
is the right approach
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearce thank you during
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
or slightly after
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
the initial testimony we were presented
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
made aware and were presented a
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
most of the members of which are no
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
longer in the
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislature with the exception of
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
senator carson
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
and we learned that the recommendations
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
of this board had really not been
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
enacted so
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
it seems as though they've already taken
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
a look at this they've got a little bit
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
of a road map here to
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
do some of these things and maybe they
 
00:55:37.599 --> 00:55:38.470 align:start position:0%
do some of these things and maybe they
should

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
work through the 2014
 
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.630 align:start position:0%
work through the 2014
study

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
i just recently read in the newspaper
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
that a new commandant has been appointed
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
at the veterans home also
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
so it seems wise to
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
let the new leadership settle down a
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
little bit before we look at doing
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
anything to the board thank you
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you my opinion is that after
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
the study was released
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
they said we should take the world war
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
one veteran off the board and none of
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
the members of the of the study
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee nor anyone else
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
bothered to do that
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
i think that we need we need to uh
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do another study it would
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
questions okay
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion is an expediting
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1191 was my bill about
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
expanding the homeowner's exemption to
 
00:58:13.119 --> 00:58:16.549 align:start position:0%
expanding the homeowner's exemption to
duplexes

00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
testimony at the hearing convinced me
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
that as written it was too broad
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
but it does deserve some
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
further study on the area of accessory
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
dwelling units
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
and also on the fact that the
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
homeowner's exemption
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
language for the various professions
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
is not consistent we need to look at
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
what the restrictions are
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
particularly in the plumbing code
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
and clean up a lot of that language and
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think interim study is a good
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes you wish to speak
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
the second thank you madam chairman i
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
actually no i think you said everything
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
any further discussion or comment
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
since this is an executive session and
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat relevant i've i'm going
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
to speak against the homeowner's
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
exemption because how can you
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
endanger your family if you are
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
an incompetent gas fitter
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
and does your family count less than a
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
stranger that i'm running across a
 
00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
stranger that i'm running across a
duplex

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
duplex
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
personally i'd like to see
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
the whole thing rewritten such that
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners can do anybody can do a like
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
for like
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
i replaced the garbage disposal like for
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
like there's nothing to it
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
essentially nothing to it
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
and but that's the end of my speech for
 
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:57.829 align:start position:0%
and but that's the end of my speech for
now

00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
well interim study would give us a
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i passed out an amendment um like a
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
week and a half two weeks ago i have i
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
do have um
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
three extra copies if anybody's missing
 
01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:07.430 align:start position:0%
three extra copies if anybody's missing
that

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
is amendment number 0244
 
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.349 align:start position:0%
is amendment number 0244
h

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
h
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to move the amendment
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
is there a second okay representative
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
represent fellows if you wish to speak
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the amendment okay
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the original bill
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
simply added an audiologist to the board
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
because um
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
it was originally enacted last year from
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
based on hb2
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it combined the speech pathology
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
board with the board that had the
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
audiology and the hearing specialists on
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
and in the process
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
we ended up with a board that didn't
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
specify an audiologist on a board that
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
oversees audiology
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
but then when the we had a lengthy
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
and we once again heard about an issue
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
we had heard before
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
that had to do with how difficult
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
it was to hold board meetings because
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get a quorum
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
and there was
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
having alternates on the board
 
01:03:32.799 --> 01:03:33.589 align:start position:0%
having alternates on the board
so

01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
what i did is this amendment
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
adds alternates
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it puts it in a place in statute
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
that enables any board that's under the
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
allied help
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
alternates simply by
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
updating the part of the statute that
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
describes their board
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
and because when you're going to have
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
alternates you have to have a have a
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
description of them and you have to
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
identify what it is that they can do and
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
when they can do it

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
do you want so maybe you can see if
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
there are copies of it here
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.030 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'll second your motion thank you
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
would you wish to speak to your motion i
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
would there
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the course of the state adopting
 
01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
in the course of the state adopting
um

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
the next batch of codes if you will as
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
we as we move forward
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
an integral
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
movement in the sense that you can't
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
really move
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
say the electric code and not move the
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
fire code at the same time or
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
some of the other codes because they all
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
reference each other so
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
you get into you get into all kinds of
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
problems so when this bill was drafted
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
just as an absolute oversight the
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
moving of the fire code up from the 2015
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
edition to the 2018 edition was
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
inadvertently left out this amendment
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
puts that
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
back where it should have been when
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
if the bill had been drafted and the
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to mention that when
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
i was drafting the bill i ran it past
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
among other people the state fire
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
marshal and
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
he i and the
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
building code review board all
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
completely blanked on missing the fire
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
code so i have to apologize for that
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
that oversight it was in the original
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
intention when we updated the codes
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
to update the entire suite
 
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.709 align:start position:0%
to update the entire suite
and

01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
it was just an oversight and i hope you
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
will help me fix it
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%

as this incorporates like i said the
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
the batch the state of new hampshire
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
little historic
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
perspective in honor of representative
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
schmidt here um
 
01:14:53.679 --> 01:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
schmidt here um
the

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
when the state adopts that series of
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
codes we typically do it on a on a
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of a delay
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
and that's been there's a plethora of
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
reasons for that those reasons have been
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
expounded upon in testimony
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um i'll point out that
 
01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
um i'll point out that
we

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
saw representatives from all of the
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
various trades
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
building code review board electrical
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
guys building officials all those folks
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
were here
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
and they're all in favor of this passing
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
as a block
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
these codes reference each other so much
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
that they do have to pass and move
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
forward as a block so
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
this will just get the state of new
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire moving forward
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
with its with its coded updates and
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
allow the builders inspectors and
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
whatnot to uh
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
to get on board with the with the
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
current changes
 
01:15:48.159 --> 01:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
current changes
okay

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to mention that this was
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendation of two separate study
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
committees on building code updates
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
one two three years ago and one this
 
01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.070 align:start position:0%
one two three years ago and one this
year

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
that recommend or last year that we
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
update the building code
 
01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:09.510 align:start position:0%
update the building code
regularly

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
on a schedule that allows us to make all
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
the amendments necessary to fit new
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire conditions
 
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire conditions
and

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
this bill includes
 
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.390 align:start position:0%
this bill includes
all

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
the not only the 2018 building codes
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
it includes the amendments adopted by
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
the building code

review board and the board of fire
 
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.950 align:start position:0%
review board and the board of fire

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
to take care of things like our ban on
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
sprinklers and single-family houses
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and addresses
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
our specific
 
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
our specific
issues

01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
other comments representative black
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay i uh
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
was torn on this that i mean we're being
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
asked to approve a whole mass of things
 
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.390 align:start position:0%
asked to approve a whole mass of things
that

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
we don't actually know what's in it i
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
understand that these boards have looked
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
it over
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
and initially my plan was to vote
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
against this only because of that
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
i had asked for details which i finally
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
did get but very very recently and i did
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
start looking through them and there is
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of material there
 
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
a lot of material there
so

01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether on net um these
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
changes are ones that i think are
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
positive or negative um
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
there has been time to look at that
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i decided to look at it as
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is you know the approval we're
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
doing is not approving it in detail
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
but it's kind of a last chance that if
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know some citizens in new hampshire
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
others had objections they could come to
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
us and we could either fix it or put a
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
stop to it
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
but i do suggest that in the future if
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
they're for this sort of thing anything
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
where we have to we're put in position
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
of approving or not approving
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
a large mass of things
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
that the details be provided well in
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
advance i'm talking um
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know month or month or months
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
so that if someone does want to look it
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
over in some detail there is the time to
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
do it so i will vote for this this time
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm not very comfortable doing so
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
i apologize that the details were not
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
provided earlier because they are
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
available they were given to the study
 
01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.149 align:start position:0%

hmm

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
when i heard the testimony on house bill
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
1357 we noted that
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
the spelling was incorrect in the
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't want to go on
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
record with that
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
and there was concerns that i heard
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
about the end game which made me think
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
of land acknowledgements
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so i was there was a phrase there
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
was a sentence added
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
at the end that says this
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement does not permit any land
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
grants pursue unto the 1713 treaty of
 
01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:30.550 align:start position:0%
grants pursue unto the 1713 treaty of
portsmouth

01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm merely asking at this time to
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment to correct the bill
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%

yes i'd just like to point out that the
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
1713 treaty is exceedingly well
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
documented with existing copies on both
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
sides of the atlantic and i
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
having read that treaty i believe it
 
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.310 align:start position:0%
having read that treaty i believe it
would

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.229 align:start position:0%
would
preclude

01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
preclude
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
the expansion of land claims based on
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
this acknowledgement which i agree could
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
become an issue so thank you
 
01:22:12.159 --> 01:22:16.950 align:start position:0%

i do thank you
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
so when i heard this bill
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
originally i put it in the ceremonial
 
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.070 align:start position:0%
originally i put it in the ceremonial
category

01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.149 align:start position:0%
category
because

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
i wasn't concerned about land grants
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
the business the the tribe would have to
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
be recognized
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
by the indian business
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bureau of indian affairs to have a
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
land grant
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
and since that takes a lot of money
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
and usually
 
01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
and usually
involves

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
involves
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
a commitment to a casino and the
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
abernathy penacook indian indians are
 
01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.270 align:start position:0%
abernathy penacook indian indians are
not

01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
there would be no land claims in new
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire with this article with this
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
amendment i mean sorry with this statue
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore i spoke to a former attorney
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
general of new hampshire
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
who said that he viewed this
 
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.790 align:start position:0%
who said that he viewed this
as

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
a ceremonial
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
or historical bill and we talked about
 
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.870 align:start position:0%
or historical bill and we talked about
it

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
i know that this committee is not
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
bills presented them and
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of that
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
but i thought of i spoke with um
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
miss puyol this morning
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
and this bill came about as a result of
 
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.270 align:start position:0%
and this bill came about as a result of
the

01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
anniversaries that are happening on the
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
seacoast for example with my town of rye
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
is having its 400th anniversary this
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
year next year i mean
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
as well as many other seacoast
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
communities so i asked the committee to
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
look at this from a historical
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
perspective in that before we came to
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and called new hampshire
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
there was a land and it was called
 
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.390 align:start position:0%
there was a land and it was called
andachna

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
andachna
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
it was an occult new hampshire
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is recognizing that this
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
land existed before we came and before
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it's part of our history
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
son of goalie do you speak to your
 
01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:54.149 align:start position:0%

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.110 align:start position:0%

okay

01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes thank you madam
 
01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes thank you madam
chairman

01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
i i think there's been a lot of bills
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we've heard
 
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
that we've heard
this

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
this particular term that start out with
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very very simple bill
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the very very
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
simple bills really scream a lot of
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
not quite so simple
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the one concern that i have is there
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
was some testimony given and there was
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
some very very
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
specific language that was given and
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
when there were questions asked onto
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what does that mean
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
everybody kind of scuttled and ran from
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
the question specifically
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
what exactly is restorative justice
 
01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
what exactly is restorative justice
that

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
was mentioned
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
but then nobody wanted to
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
refer to it that is the one concern
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
that i have is how simple really is this
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
may i speak to that please
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate sometimes that when
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill's bills are heard people who are
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
not involved with the bill
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
our public for example will come and
 
01:28:11.679 --> 01:28:13.510 align:start position:0%
our public for example will come and
testify

01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i believe that is my belief and is
 
01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:19.830 align:start position:0%
and i believe that is my belief and is
my

01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
sad

01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
sad
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.870 align:start position:0%
sad
um

01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.229 align:start position:0%
um
feeling

01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
01:28:24.239 --> 01:28:25.110 align:start position:0%
feeling
that

01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
the people who spoke after mr and mrs
 
01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
the people who spoke after mr and mrs
peyote

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
peyote
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's puyo
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're not um
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're not fair they were not fair to our
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee and they weren't fair to the
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i can understand the concerns about
 
01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.390 align:start position:0%
and i can understand the concerns about
that

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
i can't allay your concerns
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
but you have to realize that
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
not everybody
 
01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
not everybody
um

01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
i hope
that

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.629 align:start position:0%
 
fairness

01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the meaning of the legislation
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
or bill
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
and we take the element the emotional
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
elements out of it
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
other comments representative blackis
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
i share a similar concern and i
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
can understand that that's
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
not your interpretation of this i
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
certainly accept that but it points out
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
the risk that um
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know we can put something in with
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
one intent
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
and people can try and use it for other
 
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
and people can try and use it for other
purposes

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
and um you know we don't know
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's going to happen in
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
what the views of let's say courts or
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
other people might be in the future and
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
i received a number of emails from
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
members of other tribes
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
opposing this this bill appears to be
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
divisive even amongst native americans
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that's one problem with it
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the other goes along the lines of
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
what representative rhodes indicated and
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
so i won't belabor that point
 
01:30:40.239 --> 01:30:41.189 align:start position:0%
so i won't belabor that point
um

01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps with some
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
historical uh perspective but i'm not
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
waste the committee's time with it thank
 
01:30:48.159 --> 01:30:49.669 align:start position:0%
waste the committee's time with it thank
you

01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
questions concerns
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
let me waste 20 seconds
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
ever since the norman's norman french
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
invaded england might makes right and
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is another example of it this land
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment is just window dressing
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh an instance in our history of might
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
makes right
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows i just have
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
a question about that that preambulation
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
part because we share a border with
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
canada so why are we pre-emulating the
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
borders with the other states and not
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
the foreign relation with the other
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
states is in current statute and i
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
believe that we're not perambulating the
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
border with canada because we cannot
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
affect it that's the international
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
border too the other one too this is rsa
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
one this rsa is so old that it there was
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
no canada it was it was a british empire
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that's that's why they're not
 
01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
that that's that's why they're not
referenced

01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes something like that but i really i
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
think that it's because if there's a
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
dispute between the
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
between us and massachusetts we can we
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
have we know where to fight it out but
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
we really don't want to go to war with
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
canada over perambulating the bounds of
 
01:32:19.199 --> 01:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
canada over perambulating the bounds of
pittsburgh

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
just just a second point is i'm i
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
received emails about other um
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
native americans
 
01:32:35.199 --> 01:32:36.550 align:start position:0%
native americans
that

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
were not are not mentioned here and we
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
have had previous bills where we know
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
that there is some
 
01:32:44.639 --> 01:32:46.390 align:start position:0%
that there is some
disagreement

01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
disagreement
 
01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.430 align:start position:0%

about

01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%

01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know who to recognize as as
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%

picking one
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
one particular tribe and saying you're
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
you're the only ones that count and i
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't like that at all
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%

there are
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about what the effect of the
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
bill could be in the long term but also
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is disagreement among the tribes
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
as to

01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
10 8 the other direction okay motion
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
passes nine to eight i don't think this
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
will go on consent madam chair isn't
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%

01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
the comment had to do with the bill but
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you um
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
went to subcommittee and it did come out
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee with a three to two vote
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass
 
01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.950 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass
um

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
this bill will allow
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
all of the years of service
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
and wages to be used in calculating the
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
average final compensation for
 
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.990 align:start position:0%
average final compensation for
individuals

01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
currently we heard of
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
a woman that works in corrections
 
01:39:35.679 --> 01:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
a woman that works in corrections
and

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
she is
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
being forced to work overtime due to
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
staffing shortages
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
she's paying money into the retirement
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
system off of
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
all of her wages
 
01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.950 align:start position:0%
all of her wages
and

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
not all of that
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
is being calculated when she's going
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
when she comes up for retirement for her
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
um average final compensation
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
just not right
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
she's paying and being charged for a
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
benefit and not receiving the full
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
benefit she should on those wages
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
so with that being said i i will support
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass and
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
that way these folks can continue to
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative blackis
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
so i have a
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
i think a question um
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the reason for this
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
was that uh
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
there was concern that
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
um you know someone could in the last
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
few years however many years of the time
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
they're working
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
make a particular effort to really
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the amount of
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
money they're making which would
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
increase their pension
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then they'd be getting a pension
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life that's
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
based largely on just the last you know
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
limited period and that the reason for
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
that it was done this way was to prevent
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.590 align:start position:0%
that so
if

01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to change this
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
then these are you know what else should
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
we do is there's something we should do
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
to deal with what i believe you know
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you madam
 
01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:29.910 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you madam
chair

01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.790 align:start position:0%
chair
um

01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
touch upon what representative lekka
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
said there are multiple multiple
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
multiple things now in statute that are
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
that prevent spiking so this this is um
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no risk here
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
for some sort of explosion in the
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
capabilities of spiking there are many
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
other things that that are also in
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
statute that kick in
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
my my issue here
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
threefold um
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
the enaction of this back in 2010
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually violated the new hampshire
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
state constitution in part first article
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
23 because it was done retroactively
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that should have never occurred and
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
frankly i'm shocked that none of these
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
agencies ever filed suit over this under
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
that under that premise because it was a
 
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.629 align:start position:0%
that under that premise because it was a
clear

01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
clear violation
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing too is we as we heard in
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
testimony here you know we the
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
department of corrections specifically
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
as well as as some some of the other
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that are concerned law
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and fire
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
have such massive
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
staffing problems that you're putting
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
people into a situation of forced labor
 
01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.350 align:start position:0%
people into a situation of forced labor
and

01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
you're now putting people into into that
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
scenario of forced labor you're taking
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
money out of their paycheck and putting
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
it into a general corpus it is not
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
counted towards their retirement well if
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to take money out of
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
someone's paycheck based on their rate
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
of pay and you're going to put it into a
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
fund that that does not calculate
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
a benefit to them you have enacted an
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
income tax and that's exactly what this
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
equates to it equates to an income tax
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to have folks if we're
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to have especially folks that run
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
on a no income tax pledge
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is exactly an income tax that
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
exist for a very very minut
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
amount of people but it is in fact
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
an income tax
 
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.430 align:start position:0%
an income tax
so

01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
i think the fair thing here is if you're
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
going to work especially those that are
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
forced in into working if you're going
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
to work and monies are going to be drawn
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
from your paycheck then they should
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
simply count
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
no one would
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
ever get into a private sector
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
investment where you would give money to
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
an investment company and then have them
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
say oh thanks for the last five years of
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
investments but those don't really count
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
towards towards what you're doing
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
no one would enter into that sort of
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
thing in the private sector there's no
 
01:43:52.239 --> 01:43:53.430 align:start position:0%
thing in the private sector there's no
other

01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
system where that occurs it just happens
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
to occur here
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
and frankly it is a matter of fairness
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of equity and and i
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
do not support income taxes at all and
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
that's how i view this
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
senator fellow
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'd just um like
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
to respond to representative lekkis's
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
last statement and just to suggest if
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
you look at line 26
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
for their
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
pay for their hours that were beyond the
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
normal work week
 
01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.070 align:start position:0%
normal work week
that

01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
the percent
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
that that can add to their final
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
compensation is based on the average of
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
those excess hours over the entire
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
period that they were
 
01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:48.790 align:start position:0%
period that they were
employed

01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
employed
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
and you're absolutely right that people
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
used to you know build up those last
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
three years
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
but that was partially addressed
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many years ago it was
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
when they put in you know some
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions on that but then this this
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
shows that it's gonna
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
they can't spike it in the last three
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
years they can work extra hours in the
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
last three years but they're only going
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
to get credit
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
for whatever was the average over their
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
whole career and we know for
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
particularly for corrections
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
that they um it's normal for the
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
corrections office
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
officers to have a lot of
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes and i will mention that when we were
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it we found that the vast
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
bulk of people who worked a lot over
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
time in their last few years had worked
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of overtime throughout their
 
01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:42.830 align:start position:0%
a lot of overtime throughout their
career

01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
career
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
um but
yes

01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
we and we don't quite have the
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for spiking that some
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
other public pensions do
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh i knew a san francisco firefighter
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
who i i will not describe his scheme to
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
boost his pension
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't understand a lot of what's
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
been said
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
by representative pearson i don't know
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of other anti-spiking
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
stuff all over the statutes i can go
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
over it if you want
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
i don't want to thanks
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe it
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
i don't understand also that people do
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
get credit toward their pension for this
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's capped
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to be educated on that
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm just not accepting these things
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
one of the statements i heard
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
was that someone was going to lose
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars a month on
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
account of this on their pension not
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
the difference was fifteen hundred
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
dollars a month because of the
 
01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.669 align:start position:0%
dollars a month because of the
anti-spiking

01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking
 
01:46:55.679 --> 01:46:56.550 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking
that's

01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
very hard to believe also especially in
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that these people
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's forced labor or not
 
01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.550 align:start position:0%
whether it's forced labor or not
um

01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
do get compensated for it
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
this is an anti-spiking not an
 
01:47:11.119 --> 01:47:12.629 align:start position:0%
this is an anti-spiking not an
anti-pension

01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
anti-pension
 
01:47:12.639 --> 01:47:13.750 align:start position:0%
anti-pension
provision

01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's been around for about 10 years and
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's now on our doorstep
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
the other and final thing i'm a member
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system i was a teacher
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
i got no opportunity no opportunity to
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
speak of
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
to spike uh
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i would have been like to i
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
suppose sucked at that banquet but i had
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
no such opportunity
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
so some are being favored over others in
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
the even in our public sector
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think this
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
i want to put aside my dyspepsia here
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
and say i think there's some room to
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
consider things here but i'm not
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just not comfortable with this
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill i'd like to hear more
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
about it i'd like this to have a genuine
 
01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.270 align:start position:0%
about it i'd like this to have a genuine
study

01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'll leave my leave that as my remark
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative lakas
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
i guess this is another question so um
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
it says for purposes of inclusion the
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
calculation the average percent anyway
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
it refers to full base rate of
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
compensation so the question is what is
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
that i mean if you work overtime is that
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
part of that or not it is not
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay so is it just your sort of
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
base salary
 
01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.870 align:start position:0%
base salary
correct

01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
other representative fellow
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would just like to say that
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
the situation in testimony that
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec just mentioned
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
caught my attention to
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
i believe she was not referring to
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of her retirement paycheck
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
she was referring to the amount that
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
would be used in her annual final
 
01:49:01.119 --> 01:49:03.109 align:start position:0%
would be used in her annual final
compensation

01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:03.830 align:start position:0%
compensation
so

01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know you understand the difference
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
any other representative blackish yes
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
another question i mean that brings up
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if anybody has the
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
answer but uh
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
you know how much of a
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
difference would this make
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
in someone's salary if they did
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
end up working a lot i guess there's a
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
so it's talking about
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
almost 56 million dollars
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
fy23 i'm not sure
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
it is well it's limited because
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
this only applies to people who were
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
working but not yet vested when the
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
rules were changed in 2011
 
01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
rules were changed in 2011
right

01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
and correct so it's a limited population
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
that is involved
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
and the spread from three to five years
 
01:50:06.159 --> 01:50:07.830 align:start position:0%
and the spread from three to five years
um

01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
from exactly
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
the change from
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
five years to three years means it's
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
more likely that any
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
promotions that you get would be
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
reflected in your pension because it's
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
an average
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
that your final pay
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'm slightly confused on
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
your explanation with the three years
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
the three years was done away within
 
01:50:28.159 --> 01:50:30.070 align:start position:0%
the three years was done away within
2010

01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
2010
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
i mean i get confused with all these
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
the the intent is i believe that
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
to allow the even if you get a promotion
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
to have the same
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of overtime and extra duty
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
etc that you did throughout your career
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
typically folks you know as your command
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
staff works their way up sure you know
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
you you typically have folks with a lot
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
of experience
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
being in charge towards the end
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
but as you know as far as some of the
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking provisions just to give
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
just not even no details just topics we
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
have a pension cap as far as the maximum
 
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.629 align:start position:0%
have a pension cap as far as the maximum
pension

01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
pension
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
we have the 150 percent rule we have the
 
01:51:23.679 --> 01:51:24.550 align:start position:0%
we have the 150 percent rule we have the
um

01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
average of compensation based over your
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
entire career those are all anti-spiking
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
provisions so there's many anti-spiking
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
provisions that are in statute
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
that prevent those things from occurring
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
just became it's too much of a penalty
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
is is the problem with this it's you
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
know we in there were so many things
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
enacted so fast that they never really
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
gave time to vet
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of those things
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
and this one is problematic the the
 
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.470 align:start position:0%
and this one is problematic the the
other

01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
particular ones i am totally in
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
agreement with it's just this one is the
 
01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:59.990 align:start position:0%
agreement with it's just this one is the
problem

01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative if you could uh a brief
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
explanation on the 150 one you mentioned
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
sure the 150 rule has to do with you
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
you cannot
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
you cannot earn more than 150
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
of what you earned the prior year when
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
you go to retire
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
and that prevents someone from in their
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
last year let's say
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
working an exorbitant amount of
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
of time to try to boost that and that
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
150 percent rule was enacted to prevent
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
abuse that had occurred in the past and
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
it i mean that's absolutely worked
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
representing scitec
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
i noticed mr carlin here and i'd like to
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity advantage to ask
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
how's that chart doing remember when we
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
were going through representative
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
mcguire talked about vested and that
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
opened the door to i die when i'm vested
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not that i you know get hit by a
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
truck when i'm you know
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
what are my survivor benefits you're
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
going to change it from paragraph form
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we we do need that
 
01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.790 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we we do need that
because

01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
as you notice from the debate it's easy
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
for us to get confused over what this
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
bill does versus what other previous
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
bills would have done
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative i might say to
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative pearson that you've got
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
me thinking but i'm not sure just how
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
much anti
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh i got
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not persuaded yet
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
although you've made
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't cover all of them that was like
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
three of the many another time
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is there any other
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay

03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
as as a non-jermaine amendment this is a
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
slight tweak to that amendment
 
03:31:27.920 --> 03:31:29.190 align:start position:0%
slight tweak to that amendment
so

03:31:29.190 --> 03:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellowes moves amendment
 
03:31:31.840 --> 03:31:36.389 align:start position:0%
representative fellowes moves amendment
0522h

03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
certainly i second
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
so um this is the bill
 
03:31:44.560 --> 03:31:45.349 align:start position:0%
so um this is the bill
that

03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:45.359 --> 03:31:46.229 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:31:46.229 --> 03:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
one of the main features of the bill is
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
is that it renamed
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
a division
 
03:31:54.790 --> 03:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
within the department of administrative
 
03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
within the department of administrative
services

03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a division that does i t kind
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
of work
 
03:32:00.640 --> 03:32:01.750 align:start position:0%
of work
and

03:32:01.750 --> 03:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
they the original bill
 
03:32:07.990 --> 03:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
proposes a name for the um
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
division of enterprise
 
03:32:10.640 --> 03:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
division of enterprise
operations

03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
managed management i think i don't have
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
a copy right in front of me and i was
 
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about that title because
 
03:32:23.190 --> 03:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
i think i was thinking that you know
 
03:32:23.200 --> 03:32:24.070 align:start position:0%
i think i was thinking that you know
people

03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
general public isn't going to understand
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
what enterprises
 
03:32:30.229 --> 03:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
and i was also concerned with enterprise
 
03:32:30.239 --> 03:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
and i was also concerned with enterprise
operations

03:32:31.830 --> 03:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
operations
 
03:32:31.840 --> 03:32:33.190 align:start position:0%
operations
would

03:32:33.190 --> 03:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
in my mind it would be referring to all
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
so what i did is i reached out to
 
03:32:44.469 --> 03:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
dennis goulet
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
who is the commissioner of oit
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and who oversees i.t related things for
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
the whole state
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:32:54.800 --> 03:32:56.790 align:start position:0%
and also
alexander

03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
alexander
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
i believe his name is alexander
 
03:32:59.279 --> 03:33:00.469 align:start position:0%
i believe his name is alexander
stone

03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
stone
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
who is
 
03:33:01.840 --> 03:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
who is
the

03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
administrator of this division
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is proposed to be renamed
 
03:33:10.710 --> 03:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i told them my concerns about the
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
title i said i really didn't have
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the description
 
03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i asked them if they could each of
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
them if they could think of a better
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
title well what they did is they got
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
together and they reworked
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
that section of the bill
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they did change the title
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
they also
 
03:33:31.680 --> 03:33:33.429 align:start position:0%
they also
changed

03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
changed
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
on page one you can see there's a roman
 
03:33:36.239 --> 03:33:37.429 align:start position:0%
on page one you can see there's a roman
numeral

03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
one two three and four
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
about five six
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
that describes what that division does
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
they did rework that some
 
03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:49.110 align:start position:0%
they did rework that some
also

03:33:49.110 --> 03:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:33:52.229 --> 03:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
and the email that i got back from
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of oit
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
was that that was
 
03:33:56.880 --> 03:33:58.229 align:start position:0%
was that that was
necessary

03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:33:58.239 --> 03:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
necessary
because

03:33:59.480 --> 03:33:59.490 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:33:59.490 --> 03:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
because
[Music]

03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
the original wording
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to imply
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
that that division
 
03:34:10.389 --> 03:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
would have domain over some things that
 
03:34:11.830 --> 03:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
are clearly
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
the domain of oit so
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
in that section two
 
03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
in that section two
is

03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
not my words but what
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
that division director
 
03:34:31.030 --> 03:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner of oit came up with
 
03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then the only other thing that is
 
03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:34.950 align:start position:0%
and then the only other thing that is
different

03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
between this and
 
03:34:40.830 --> 03:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
chairman mcguire's
 
03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is that
 
03:34:45.429 --> 03:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
on the second page
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
on paid on line six
 
03:34:49.750 --> 03:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
or line five
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
they just had to change that title
 
03:34:51.439 --> 03:34:53.110 align:start position:0%
they just had to change that title
because

03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's the director of and i had they
 
03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
had to use the new name there
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
other other than that it's exactly um
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
like representative mcguire's bill
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
hey representative schuett you used to
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%

on another committee and
 
03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:42.790 align:start position:0%
on another committee and
for

03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%

said you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they say no thank you
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%

we no votes
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%

important thing for a job title

um i think that
this

03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
amendment is important because it brings
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
up to date what is happening in a
 
03:38:58.950 --> 03:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
division within administrative services
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
and that's a division that has
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
a very significant role
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
you can see read what they do on page
 
03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:07.349 align:start position:0%
you can see read what they do on page

one
 
03:39:07.359 --> 03:39:11.189 align:start position:0%
one
and

03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:11.199 --> 03:39:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire would you like to
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
speak to the two other parts
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'll yes thank you i'll uh the original
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill addressed the fact that when we
 
03:39:29.429 --> 03:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
created those unclassified positions
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't we give them a specific term
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
so they had an indefinite term which is
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
generally not recommended so the first
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
part of the bill simply gives them a
 
03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
four-year term
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
as a common one in the executive branch
 
03:39:46.319 --> 03:39:47.429 align:start position:0%
as a common one in the executive branch
the

03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
training fund
 
03:39:48.840 --> 03:39:50.389 align:start position:0%
training fund
upped

03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
upped
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
being allowed to increase to 100 000 is
 
03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:55.590 align:start position:0%
being allowed to increase to 100 000 is
partly

03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
partly
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
before it
 
03:39:59.670 --> 03:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
lapses to the general fund is partly due
 
03:39:59.680 --> 03:40:00.630 align:start position:0%
lapses to the general fund is partly due
to

03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
inflation of course and more people
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
getting training courses
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's also a factor of the fact
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
factor that many of the courses are done
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the summer
 
03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:13.429 align:start position:0%
in the summer
so

03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to have the money to
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
pay for them and not have it lapse just
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
because the budget expires at the end of
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
and because of that bill is going to go
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
to finance for that to take to look at
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
other than that um
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
let's i support it
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
crickets okay thank you
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%

this um
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is a new this is an important bill
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
to me actually
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
my my community of dairy has some some
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
very serious concerns
 
03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:35.890 align:start position:0%
uh in reference to
 
03:42:35.890 --> 03:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
uh in reference to
[Music]

03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement of
 
03:42:42.150 --> 03:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
many things surrounding these
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
establishments and
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill
 
03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:50.389 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill
doesn't

03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:42:54.389 --> 03:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite give the local
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
enabling that that i think would be more
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
necessary and more effective here than
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
having this come out of the office of
 
03:43:01.680 --> 03:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
having this come out of the office of
oplc

03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
so you know this i
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
don't don't look at this as death with
 
03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
dignity here i really do think that we
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
need to
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
to look at this and find a way to make
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
this work
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
for those communities that do in fact
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
have concerns
 
03:43:19.590 --> 03:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
um surrounding
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
massage establishments and
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
not really burden
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
a state agency
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
where the overwhelming majority of the
 
03:43:27.439 --> 03:43:28.469 align:start position:0%

more
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%

03:44:12.150 --> 03:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
other comments questions

other comments questions
represent

03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
part of that resolution is uh it became
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
clear in the discussion it's not
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
it isn't clear that the towns
 
03:44:20.960 --> 03:44:22.469 align:start position:0%
it isn't clear that the towns
municipalities

03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
are authorized to do this
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
and that ought to be
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's got to be part of what's
 
03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:32.070 align:start position:0%
that's got to be part of what's
addressed

03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we we did get some comments from
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
other municipalities
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
but the the thrust was from derry and
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
all the other municipalities were in the
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
southeast corner of the state
 
03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:46.469 align:start position:0%
southeast corner of the state
so

03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
imposing a statewide registration
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:44:50.960 --> 03:44:52.309 align:start position:0%
for a
seacoast

03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
and massachusetts border problem seemed
 
03:44:54.960 --> 03:45:02.150 align:start position:0%
and massachusetts border problem seemed
excessive

03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to point out there's
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
nothing really wrong with the southeast
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
i concur
 
03:45:11.910 --> 03:45:11.920 align:start position:0%

in that case we'll take up the last
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
early bill that doesn't need an
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%

03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to move itl on house bill
 
03:47:03.760 --> 03:47:06.229 align:start position:0%
i would like to move itl on house bill
1417

03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
1417
 
03:47:10.710 --> 03:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay would you speak to your motion
 
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
the towns in new hampshire have full
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
authority on how many employees they
 
03:47:27.030 --> 03:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
would like to hire and to what they
 
03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
would like to pay all of those employees
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the state is going to be contributing
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
to to this portion um i think that it
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
would only also be fair that the state
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
had the responsibility
 
03:47:41.590 --> 03:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
of actually hiring the employees and
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
also helping to set the rate
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
and i also think that despite the fact
 
03:47:46.389 --> 03:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
verbiage that we've been hearing a lot
 
03:47:47.920 --> 03:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
verbiage that we've been hearing a lot
of

03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
all of the downshifting to the towns
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
from 2011 that was actually
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
shifted down to the responsibility of
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lackas
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
i agree with that and and actually i
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
remember i think it was in 2020 our
 
03:48:11.110 --> 03:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
delegation for our district got
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
kind of called on the carpet before the
 
03:48:13.199 --> 03:48:14.150 align:start position:0%
kind of called on the carpet before the
uh

03:48:14.150 --> 03:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:16.389 --> 03:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
boards of selectmen of of hudson and
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
pelham on this issue
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we expressed the same
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
thing we asked them so if you want us to
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
help pay for it
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh would you be okay with us uh
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know controlling the number of
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
employees you can hire and putting some
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
limitations on the pay
 
03:48:33.910 --> 03:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
they did not find that attractive and uh
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
but i think it would only be reasonable
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're in effect
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know providing an unlimited
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
potentially amount of money so thank you
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
hey representative o'brien had a comment

thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
the reason i arise is because i strongly
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
disagree i think there's some
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
basically what people believe is true
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
but it may not actually be 100 percent
 
03:49:02.800 --> 03:49:03.990 align:start position:0%
but it may not actually be 100 percent
factual

03:49:03.990 --> 03:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
factual
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%

03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
with the state paying 35 percent that
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
has been morphed down to zero
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
that 35 percent where did it go it
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
didn't vaporize okay it got thrown back
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
on to the employees it also got thrown
 
03:49:52.710 --> 03:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
back on to the municipality
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
now i hear there's limitations
 
03:49:55.520 --> 03:49:56.550 align:start position:0%
now i hear there's limitations
well

03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:49:58.710 --> 03:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not here i was a firefighter i'm not
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
here to give you a math lesson
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
but when you come to a pension system it
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what you pay
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
your your employees has nothing to do
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
with it at all
 
03:50:12.870 --> 03:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's based on the lara percentages
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
if uh somebody is making one dollar an
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
hour would they put as much into the
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
pension system as somebody who's making
 
03:50:22.550 --> 03:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
two dollars an hour no
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
if they're paying a certain percentage
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
the person that pays that's getting the
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
higher rate goes in
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
so therefore it's not really affecting
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
an hrs
 
03:50:34.870 --> 03:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
when it comes down to it it has to do
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
with the laws of percentages nothing to
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
do what firefighters cops or teachers
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
are being paid
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of things have happened besides
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
the ull
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
that is now currently be faced by many
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
in order to get back and i strongly
 
03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
encourage that i would like to see a
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
pension system that is 100 percent
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
funded and ready to go
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
but right now your tax payers need a
 
03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:06.710 align:start position:0%
but right now your tax payers need a
break

03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
break
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
whether you have one cop in your town
 
03:51:10.640 --> 03:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
whether you have one cop in your town
or

03:51:11.830 --> 03:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
200 such as the city of nashua does or
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
any teachers one teacher or 200 teachers
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
they're paying into the nhrs system
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
nashua is paying
 
03:51:24.399 --> 03:51:25.349 align:start position:0%
nashua is paying
4

03:51:25.349 --> 03:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
4
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year fathom that
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
because of nhrs obligations
 
03:51:36.150 --> 03:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
four million dollars it only takes two
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars to raise the tax rate in
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
the city of nashville one percent
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is a two percent tax rate all this
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
bill is saying
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's asking to state what they
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
originally started in 1968
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
to step forward
 
03:51:57.990 --> 03:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
honor their original obligations and pay
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
not thirty
 
03:52:01.750 --> 03:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
or thirty five percent
 
03:52:04.630 --> 03:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
but basically come up and only pay per
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
employee seven five per seven point five
 
03:52:07.760 --> 03:52:08.790 align:start position:0%
employee seven five per seven point five
percent

03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
where will that money go you'll be
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
thanked by your taxpayers thank you
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you does it representative growth
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
and then like us
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
when the new hampshire retirement system
 
03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:27.349 align:start position:0%
when the new hampshire retirement system
was

03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:52:27.359 --> 03:52:29.670 align:start position:0%
was
initiated

03:52:29.670 --> 03:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
03:52:30.630 --> 03:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
initiated by the state
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
and municipalities were asked to join
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
municipality employees were asked to
 
03:52:37.120 --> 03:52:40.550 align:start position:0%
municipality employees were asked to
join

03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
enticement let's say
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
for getting the municipalities to join
 
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retirement system
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
was that the state would pay
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.830 --> 03:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
that municipalities would have
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
employee employee amounts
 
03:53:07.600 --> 03:53:09.030 align:start position:0%
employee employee amounts
paid

03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
paid
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
is not affected by
 
03:53:10.880 --> 03:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
is not affected by
where

03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
the government's
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
contribution comes from whether it be
 
03:53:19.110 --> 03:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
from the state or from municipalities
 
03:53:19.120 --> 03:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
from the state or from municipalities
now

03:53:20.710 --> 03:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state has you know has good times
 
03:53:24.870 --> 03:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
and bad times and
 
03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
one of the decisions to reduce the
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
amount of the state would have to pay
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
had to do with the difficult times that
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
the state was
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
having in revenues
 
03:53:36.399 --> 03:53:38.389 align:start position:0%
having in revenues
and

03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:40.150 --> 03:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed of
 
03:53:40.160 --> 03:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed of
of

03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
having obligations from states
 
03:53:46.630 --> 03:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities necessarily changed but
 
03:53:49.030 --> 03:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
a permanent
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
shift from the state to the municipal to
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
the municipalities for their portion of
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
is unfair
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it's unfair the people
 
03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
and it's unfair the people
who

03:54:02.630 --> 03:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
and example of those municipalities who
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
entered into this agreement in good
 
03:54:06.560 --> 03:54:09.349 align:start position:0%
entered into this agreement in good
faith

03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
and now
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
their good faith is being taken
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i support this um
 
03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:18.389 align:start position:0%
so i support this um
bill

03:54:18.389 --> 03:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:54:18.399 --> 03:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
bill
and

03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
i support what representative o'brien
 
03:54:21.600 --> 03:54:24.309 align:start position:0%
i support what representative o'brien
says

03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:29.830 --> 03:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
hey representative blackis thank you um
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly sympathetic to the
 
03:54:31.359 --> 03:54:32.870 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly sympathetic to the
taxpayers

03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know having to pay
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
what they're paying
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
to make up for the ual i'm one of them
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i would also support something like
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
requiring that some percentage of any
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
surplus the state has going to pay off
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
the ual which would then
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
directly help the taxpayers
 
03:54:51.840 --> 03:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
directly help the taxpayers
um

03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not supporting this because
 
03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
it it's you know if we're paying 77 if
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
we are to pay seven and a half percent
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
of the contributions then yes that is
 
03:55:04.229 --> 03:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
entirely dependent on the number of
 
03:55:06.309 --> 03:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
employees in the and the pay of those
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
employees so there is a direct relation
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
between what the state's gonna have to
 
03:55:10.080 --> 03:55:10.870 align:start position:0%
between what the state's gonna have to
pay

03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
and what the municipalities choose to do
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
around hiring and compensation
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i have a concern about that
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing is as i understand the
 
03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:21.189 align:start position:0%
the other thing is as i understand the
history

03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
at the time i guess 2011
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
when the state stopped paying the 35
 
03:55:26.399 --> 03:55:27.590 align:start position:0%
when the state stopped paying the 35
percent

03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
that amount of money in its entirety
 
03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh was
 
03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
shifted to the employees none of it to
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
the municipalities now at the same time
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
there were changes in
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
actuarial assumptions uh assumptions
 
03:55:42.640 --> 03:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
actuarial assumptions uh assumptions
around

03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:55:46.070 --> 03:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
demography and other things which did
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
substantially increase the amount that
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
the municipalities had to pay
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
but that that increase was not due to
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the states
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
stopping to pay the 35 percent at least
 
03:55:56.880 --> 03:55:57.750 align:start position:0%
stopping to pay the 35 percent at least
that's

03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the history which
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things there's two things
 
03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:12.309 align:start position:0%
one of the things there's two things
here

03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
with this um
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
the first one is i would have this was
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
this would really have
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
been a better argument when we were
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
creating the budget
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's the first one the second one
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
because of the way
 
03:56:29.269 --> 03:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
because we're using a timed based
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
a duration based method of paying off
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability
 
03:56:38.229 --> 03:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does not accelerate the payoff
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
and because of that it contributes
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the tremendous rollercoaster effect
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
that municipalities are experiencing
 
03:56:54.389 --> 03:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
every two years when the rate changes
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
i would
 
03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
i would
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to get on board with
 
03:57:00.950 --> 03:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
a seven and a half percent contribution
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
provided that went into paying and
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
accelerating the debt
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
and getting rid of the debt rather than
 
03:57:07.120 --> 03:57:10.309 align:start position:0%
and getting rid of the debt rather than
just

03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
the employer rate or you know that
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
i i just
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
continuing to go down that road like
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't really do anything to
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
speed this problem
 
03:57:22.239 --> 03:57:23.429 align:start position:0%
speed this problem
up

03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
i i just i agree with representative
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
leckas i think the focus really
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
needs with with the amount the money's
 
03:57:36.630 --> 03:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
involved here needs to involve the
 
03:57:39.269 --> 03:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
acceleration of the payoff of debt
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
and not just the
 
03:57:41.199 --> 03:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
and not just the
the

03:57:42.150 --> 03:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
minuscule relief that this may provide
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
03:57:52.150 --> 03:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
first i'll say that representative lucas
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
if you want to put the bill in that a
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of any surplus we get in the
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
state go to paying the unfunded
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
liability put me down as a co-sponsor
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
but as this goes
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
this bill here is
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
direct property tax relief
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think anyone out there who talks to
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
any of
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
their whether it's a alderman
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
town council whoever you talk to
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
will tell you we will take this this is
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
direct property tax relief from the
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
state that's running a
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
huge surplus right now
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
has plenty of money out there to help
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
03:58:37.110 --> 03:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
this is what they're asking for
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's one person out
 
03:58:40.630 --> 03:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
there if you ask them if the state would
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
save send some of this money back to
 
03:58:42.319 --> 03:58:43.590 align:start position:0%
save send some of this money back to
them

03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:49.830 --> 03:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to support this
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to support the people in my
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
community that are asking for this
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i'll be voting against the
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
unexpedient the legislate
 
03:58:57.439 --> 03:58:58.790 align:start position:0%
unexpedient the legislate
okay

03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:59:06.710 --> 03:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
i i would just like to echo what
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative goalie just said you know
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
particularly my town at plymouth is they
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
just really need some help with property
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative allegra
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
if i were the municipality that had a
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
huge deficit i would be saying send the
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:29.840 --> 03:59:31.429 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
i have to represent the people of
 
03:59:32.880 --> 03:59:34.550 align:start position:0%
i have to represent the people of
campton

03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
campton
 
03:59:34.560 --> 03:59:38.309 align:start position:0%
campton
and

03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
i have to encourage campton to be
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i i can't see my way clear
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
to saying that
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
other municipalities and and this goes
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
hand in hand with representative lexis
 
03:59:51.279 --> 03:59:53.189 align:start position:0%
hand in hand with representative lexis
statements

03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
statements
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh that have a free hand to hire as many
 
03:59:57.670 --> 03:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
people as they want
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
and pay them whatever they want
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
i mean if you look at the school budgets
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's just obscene
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
there are more paraeducators and
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
god only knows what then there are
 
04:00:08.720 --> 04:00:09.750 align:start position:0%
god only knows what then there are
teachers

04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
04:00:12.150 --> 04:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i can't see telling
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
my constituents in campton
 
04:00:16.710 --> 04:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
that they're going to need to be paying
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
for the overruns in retirement systems
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
and other municipalities so i can't
 
04:00:20.640 --> 04:00:21.750 align:start position:0%
and other municipalities so i can't
support

04:00:21.750 --> 04:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
that concept
 
04:00:26.309 --> 04:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
point of order minimum chair
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think it is appropriate for us
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
as committee members to make comments on
 
04:00:34.630 --> 04:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
how other people run their towns and
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're fiscally
 
04:00:36.239 --> 04:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're fiscally
responsible

04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
04:00:41.429 --> 04:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's not a point of order first of all
 
04:00:44.000 --> 04:00:44.950 align:start position:0%
that's not a point of order first of all
but

04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
it is a con comment yes and i would have
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
to agree that
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
it may not be polite but it is
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely true that there are towns
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
that spend a whole lot more than other
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
similar towns
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another
 
04:01:04.150 --> 04:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
in fact i will comment that in my town
 
04:01:07.510 --> 04:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the town management is frugal and
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
efficient and the school board is not
 
04:01:13.269 --> 04:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
so i understand what representative
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
allegro's comment is that you can see
 
04:01:18.150 --> 04:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
the difference in attitude between the
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
two boards
 
04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you've experienced
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
similar things by looking at other towns
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
in your own i have but just because
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
towns treat their budgets differently
 
04:01:33.510 --> 04:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
that i believe is a matter of opinion
 
04:01:38.790 --> 04:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we are entitled to our opinions at
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
this point as long as they are expressed
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully and politely your your
 
04:01:44.000 --> 04:01:45.110 align:start position:0%
respectfully and politely your your
opinion

04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
you can express your opinion here
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec and then lekis
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
i see other worthy members i'm not going
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
to disagree with representative goalie
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
but i'll point out two things first this
 
04:02:00.389 --> 04:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
has been in effect for a long time i'm
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
not sure why it's suddenly today this
 
04:02:06.550 --> 04:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
session has become as urgent as it seems
 
04:02:08.070 --> 04:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:02:10.150 --> 04:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
and you may answer that i suppose the
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
second thing is this
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
this goes to human nature if i told you
 
04:02:18.150 --> 04:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow our tax rate the local property
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
tax rate was halved
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
a week later people would still say it's
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
too much
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:30.150 --> 04:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
laccas thank you um
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
another reason why i would prefer uh
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
helping pay off the ual through some
 
04:02:37.349 --> 04:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
portion of any surplus rather than this
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
um this is a fixed amount and it's going
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
to be that fixed amount unless the
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
statutes change regardless of
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
the economic situation and the financial
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
situation of the state
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i you know i don't want to
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know more built-in spending at the
 
04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
state level to increase pressure for for
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
other things um whereas if it's done as
 
04:03:01.199 --> 04:03:02.229 align:start position:0%
other things um whereas if it's done as
a

04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
a part of a surplus then when times are
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
good and we have the extra money
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
we can help out by paying it down but
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's not something that has to happen
 
04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
every year thank you
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh yes thank you madam
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
chair as long as we're going to talk
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
about towns being fiscally prudent i'm
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
very proud of my town my town has never
 
04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
approved a bond issue ever i can say
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
that because i'm the moderator i think
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
we run a remarkably uh prudent town we
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
have we don't have fire we don't have
 
04:03:29.520 --> 04:03:30.550 align:start position:0%
have we don't have fire we don't have
police

04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
police
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very small place and
 
04:03:34.870 --> 04:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
yet our tax rate is twice what it is
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
just a hundred yards down the road in
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
the town of wolfeboro mostly because
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
they have lakefront and we don't
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
i don't represent the town of wolfeboro
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
the towns that i represent very much
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
want to see property tax relief and
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
therefore i will be voting against the
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
itl motion
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'brien
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:58.469 --> 04:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
04:04:01.990 --> 04:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative lakers said like this is
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
a fixed amount
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is a building block
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
to get back to the 35 percent i don't
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
take it as that but it will be on the
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
books for a while but look what it will
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
do again this is a tax payer friendly
 
04:04:17.199 --> 04:04:18.630 align:start position:0%
do again this is a tax payer friendly
bill

04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay now
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
you say fiscally conscious
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities are
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
i got a whole
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know 100 000 people in nashua that
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
could disagree with you they might say
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing a great job a mediocre job
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
or something like that but they have an
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
opinion you know why they have an
 
04:04:38.399 --> 04:04:39.830 align:start position:0%
opinion you know why they have an
opinion

04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
because we as city fathers are doing our
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
job now how do you become fiscally
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
conscious on a matter of the subject
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it's called the
 
04:04:48.239 --> 04:04:49.349 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it's called the
unions

04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
unions
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
the unions come up and they ask for
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
certain type of wages
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is negotiation
 
04:04:58.630 --> 04:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
which is sanctioned by this state
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
there's no commitment that any
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
municipality has to pay anything
 
04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
but basically they listen to the unions
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
and try to come up with a fair and
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
equitable wage to all
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
now it was brought up in the past
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
we need more firemen we need more cops
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
we need more good qualified teachers and
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
nashua does
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
nashua is a large city i wish i lived in
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
your little towns
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
but i don't i chose
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
as part of my career to defend and to
 
04:05:30.800 --> 04:05:31.990 align:start position:0%
as part of my career to defend and to
protect

04:05:31.990 --> 04:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
protect
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
the city of nashua yes i had people
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
bleed on me throw up on me and other
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
type of
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
bodily fluids all over the place that
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
you may not have in your own little type
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
of communities and god bless you
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
but when nashua goes to look to hire
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
particular people to take these type of
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
occupations you got to give them
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
something that they're going to see the
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
chances of going to a fire
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
and nashua or greater than maybe in your
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
own community i'm sure
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
my brother
 
04:06:06.150 --> 04:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative goalie would say the same
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
thing about manchester
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
so therefore this is part of the
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
conversation so it has really nothing to
 
04:06:12.160 --> 04:06:13.510 align:start position:0%
conversation so it has really nothing to
do

04:06:13.510 --> 04:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
cities are fiscally conscious when they
 
04:06:18.150 --> 04:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
negotiate the union contract
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
again do not compare this to the ull
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's a separate subject matter
 
04:06:27.550 --> 04:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
all this basically does what
 
04:06:30.309 --> 04:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to pay
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
to make up the loss of the 35 percent
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the ull
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's the loss of the 35 percent this
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
just puts a little piece back into the
 
04:06:43.040 --> 04:06:44.309 align:start position:0%
just puts a little piece back into the
mix

04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
mix
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
to come up to help out the taxpayers
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
because the ull
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
already made a fiscal impact to nashua
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
this will help relieve it a little bit
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i think in some of our
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
local communities and
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
that is your job now
 
04:07:06.550 --> 04:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
to help out those communities and to be
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
fiscally prudent i hope you join with me
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
and not supporting the otp
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
and stand with me when i come back with
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative motion
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
upon the defeat of the otp thank you
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
believe you mean defeat of the itl
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
defeated the itl and i stand correct and
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
i thank the chief that's quite all right
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want people to think you're
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
advocating to kill the bill when
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair of irish i can argue both
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
sides of the equation
 
04:07:38.159 --> 04:07:40.149 align:start position:0%
sides of the equation
likewise

04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments representative
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
allegra i'm not going to belabor this
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what bleeding and throwing
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
up has to do with any of this but for
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
the record i've had plenty of people
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
bleed and throw up all over me and have
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
yanked a couple or a few out of the
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
wreckage and uh out of the water myself
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
that aside
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
spending yourself into millions and
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in debt

irresponsibility and if that offends

04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
the motion passes 10 to 8.
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think this should be on consent
 
04:09:45.840 --> 04:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
i don't think this should be on consent
uh

04:09:47.110 --> 04:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%

make a note of your that you will do
 
04:09:56.720 --> 04:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
make a note of your that you will do
that

04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:10:13.040 --> 04:10:14.710 align:start position:0%
yes yes
okay

04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are still three early bills left
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1535 has an amendment that's
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
not here yet
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
and the other two we can't do today
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
so among the non-early bills we have
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
represent representative santanastasso
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you have a motion on house bill 1065.
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am jared like to make a motion
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
and expedient to legislate
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh for house bill
 
04:10:41.920 --> 04:10:44.710 align:start position:0%
uh for house bill
1065

04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
1065
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am chair uh
 
04:10:59.110 --> 04:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
so this uh
 
04:10:59.120 --> 04:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
so this uh
bill

04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
adds licensure rules for uh art
 
04:11:02.479 --> 04:11:03.510 align:start position:0%
adds licensure rules for uh art
therapists

04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
04:11:03.520 --> 04:11:04.469 align:start position:0%
therapists
um

04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to be that the motivation for
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
this bill was
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to file insurance claims uh
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
because they
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
they use they piggyback off the license
 
04:11:13.760 --> 04:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
they use they piggyback off the license
system

04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and the reason why i'd like to be
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
initially and to legislate this is
 
04:11:18.880 --> 04:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
initially and to legislate this is
because

04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:11:19.760 --> 04:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
because
the

04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
the reason we do licensing is for uh you
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
know uh health and safety safety of the
 
04:11:25.760 --> 04:11:26.950 align:start position:0%
know uh health and safety safety of the
public

04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
and to go ahead and start
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
making a licensing to
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
facilitate insurance
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
billing would actually undermine the
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
narrative of why we do licensing in the
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
in addition to that there was actually
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
no art therapists
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
that testified in support of the bill so
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
i don't actually see it as a
 
04:11:47.199 --> 04:11:56.149 align:start position:0%
i don't actually see it as a
problem

04:11:56.149 --> 04:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:58.070 --> 04:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative bailey do you wish
 
04:12:01.110 --> 04:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
to speak to your second no thank you
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
all right other comments representative
 
04:12:03.520 --> 04:12:04.469 align:start position:0%
all right other comments representative
marsh

04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i'm afraid i
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
can't support this motion i believe the
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
alternative motion not to be ought to
 
04:12:11.110 --> 04:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
pass with the amendment i just passed
 
04:12:11.120 --> 04:12:12.149 align:start position:0%
pass with the amendment i just passed
out

04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the reason being that there are many
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
areas of health care where licensing is
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
used particularly for insurance purposes
 
04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i see no reason why art therapy
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
should be any different
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
we clearly have a shortage of mental
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
health providers and and we hear
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
testimony about the art therapists are
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to be useful in that regard
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
merely changes the word board to office
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
of professional license insurance
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
certification on page 2 line 22 which
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
was a request of oplc when they
 
04:12:41.199 --> 04:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
was a request of oplc when they
testified

04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you we can't really discuss the
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendment until the itl motion has been
 
04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
defeated but thank you for
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
04:12:56.399 --> 04:12:57.349 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
uh

04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
that sounded like
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh my uh
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry last time look
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're being forced into a position
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative marsh rather glibly
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
said that we just accept this business
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we're going to license for the sake
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
of insurance reimbursement why don't we
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
face the issue and figure out some
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
honest way
 
04:13:22.149 --> 04:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
to provide for this rather than going
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
through this business there is no issue
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me with a straight face
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
that there is an issue of public health
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
and safety involved with art music uh
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
therapist that kind of thing they're
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
useful people i'm not descri i'm not
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
denying that and they should be paid for
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
their services but it's not a threat
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
we're public health we're about public
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
health and safety and i really i don't
 
04:13:47.910 --> 04:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
have the imagination to figure it out
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
but there should be some way to
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
talk to the insurance companies or
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
commerce committee to figure out how
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
this can be done in a straightforward
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
way rather than this pretend
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.960 --> 04:14:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you much of what i was going to
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
say was just covered by representative
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
scitec the only thing i would add is
 
04:14:13.760 --> 04:14:14.950 align:start position:0%
scitec the only thing i would add is
that

04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to encourage the commerce
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
committee to look into the possibility
 
04:14:18.399 --> 04:14:20.070 align:start position:0%
committee to look into the possibility
of

04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
having the insurance companies okay
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
payment based on you know maybe some
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
national certification
 
04:14:27.590 --> 04:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
rather than um
 
04:14:29.349 --> 04:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
forcing them to go through licensure
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
which really isn't intended for that
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
um i believe we heard in testimony that
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
a year or so ago
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
the definition of
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
what is an art therapist was
 
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
was updated
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have it in front of me
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
but that definition requires a master's
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
degree at least and we're so we're not
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
something that's you know we're not
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
talking about art teachers we're not
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
talking about people that
 
04:15:09.750 --> 04:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
that just do
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
fun recreational activities we're
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
talking about people who do things like
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
help veterans that have ptsd
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
and helping children who have been
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
exposed to trauma in their life
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
and they're in are indeed ways that you
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
could make that situation worse if you
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
did not know what you were doing
 
04:15:32.149 --> 04:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
and many other states licensed art
 
04:15:32.159 --> 04:15:33.510 align:start position:0%
and many other states licensed art
therapists

04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
it it in some states it falls under the
 
04:15:35.680 --> 04:15:37.110 align:start position:0%
it it in some states it falls under the
therapy

04:15:37.110 --> 04:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
04:15:37.120 --> 04:15:38.550 align:start position:0%
therapy
category

04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
so i mean maybe representative marsh
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
knows more the like details of the
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
medical thing that i do but this is not
 
04:15:46.000 --> 04:15:48.229 align:start position:0%
medical thing that i do but this is not
just

04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is an important
 
04:15:51.840 --> 04:15:53.429 align:start position:0%
you know this is an important
occupation

04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
occupation
 
04:15:55.510 --> 04:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
that helps people
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
that need
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
mental help so
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
i just think i think
 
04:16:03.510 --> 04:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting into the insurance issue is
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
really off track i i really don't even
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
think we belong there i think we're
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking at it from the
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
perspective of
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
um if people are going to do this are
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
they qualified in a way that they will
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
help people and do no harm i think that
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
that is the main point of
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
what licensure is about thank you thank
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
you a couple of years ago
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned we did discuss art
 
04:16:28.560 --> 04:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned we did discuss art
therapy

04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we protected the name
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
such that only a person who has the
 
04:16:34.319 --> 04:16:35.830 align:start position:0%
such that only a person who has the
appropriate

04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
education and is certified by their
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
national professional organization can
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
call themselves an art therapist
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
that's the current current law
 
04:16:46.399 --> 04:16:48.870 align:start position:0%
that's the current current law
and

04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
the other issue of course
 
04:16:53.110 --> 04:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that the various types of mental
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
health counselors
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
social workers and mental health
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
counselors in particular are so
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
exclusive that they won't consider
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
an art therapist as a
 
04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor unless they also
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
get a mental health counselor degree
 
04:17:11.439 --> 04:17:12.229 align:start position:0%
get a mental health counselor degree
which

04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think is
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
excessive if we could
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
get a
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
broader mental health
 
04:17:19.199 --> 04:17:21.510 align:start position:0%
broader mental health
professional

04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
professional
 
04:17:21.520 --> 04:17:22.630 align:start position:0%
professional
license

04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
then that would solve the problem of
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
every little specific slice
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
trying to come in and get their own
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
their own statute
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i i think that that would be more
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
useful than trying to
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
license as i said every
 
04:17:40.880 --> 04:17:42.149 align:start position:0%
license as i said every
little

04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:17:42.159 --> 04:17:43.670 align:start position:0%
little
sub-specialty

04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
sub-specialty
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
the doctors managed to do it
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
a cardiologist and a dermatologist are
 
04:17:49.520 --> 04:17:50.309 align:start position:0%
a cardiologist and a dermatologist are
both

04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
licensed under the board of medicine but
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
and that's my my speech on the issue
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh any other comments questions
 
04:18:03.439 --> 04:18:04.830 align:start position:0%
uh any other comments questions
representative

04:18:04.830 --> 04:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
seif this is not in order but i'll try
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
to make it brief
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'll mention this in terms of something
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
else we're all my feeling is we're over
 
04:18:14.479 --> 04:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
else we're all my feeling is we're over
licensed

04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the ice the professions i would like
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
to de-license
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
are the ones who have voted with their
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
feet that can't even make a quorum
 
04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
is licensing that important that they
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
can't even show up for their meetings
 
04:18:29.439 --> 04:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
can't even show up for their meetings
and

04:18:31.110 --> 04:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a fan of certification i'm not going
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
to deny i'm looking at you but i'm not
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just talking out loud you know you
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
made a good point about the people do
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
good things but
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to vent representative
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
marsh uh yes i would just like to point
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
out that the way this bill works is that
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
the licensed art therapists are going to
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
be licensed by the board of mental
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
health practice
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of other people who are
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
doing similar things and working on
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
mental health uh in their various
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
modalities and that is not dissimilar
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
from the fact that the board of medicine
 
04:19:13.110 --> 04:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh licenses multiple categories of
 
04:19:15.349 --> 04:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
medicine so i think there's a lot more
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
similarity in this bill than uh would be
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
we would be led to believe listening to
 
04:19:23.429 --> 04:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
what we just heard
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
all right looks like everybody's said
 
04:19:30.560 --> 04:19:31.510 align:start position:0%
all right looks like everybody's said
enough

04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl on house bill 1065 and
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.439 --> 04:19:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes

you for asking

and now for something completely
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
different representative rhodes you have
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you i i would like
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
to move that we
 
04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
find house bill 1321 in expedient to
 
04:21:03.120 --> 04:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
find house bill 1321 in expedient to
legislate

04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
is there a second this is the bill we
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
heard i'll second that okay
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
all right representative roger we should
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
speak to you
 
04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
i'm actually still a little bit puzzled
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
on exactly what the representative was
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
attempting to relay to us this morning
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
of what this bill actually addresses
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
especially considering that there have
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
been a few other bills that have already
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
been passed
 
04:21:35.110 --> 04:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
that concern the governor's
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
authority on
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
emergency powers
 
04:21:38.399 --> 04:21:39.189 align:start position:0%
emergency powers
and

04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
other than that i
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
think that's all i have to say
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative peterson thank you
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair i
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'll echo um
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
the words of my colleague here that i am
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
still not sure what the presenter was
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
considering he filed two two bills that
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
were almost identical
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
i do have concerns um
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
simply about some of the language that
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
especially you know the the early part
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
line seven eight nine i mean just just
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that you would not
 
04:22:16.840 --> 04:22:18.469 align:start position:0%
the fact that you would not
want

04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
the governor to be notifying the other
 
04:22:20.560 --> 04:22:21.910 align:start position:0%
the governor to be notifying the other
branches

04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
branches
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
this is something where the separation
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
of powers really needs to come together
 
04:22:31.110 --> 04:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
on something of a critical nature
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
require a state of emergency that i i
 
04:22:34.800 --> 04:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
require a state of emergency that i i
don't

04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:22:37.110 --> 04:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't even understand the logic in
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
that so
 
04:22:40.469 --> 04:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
so this is um
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
considering all the other things that
 
04:22:43.349 --> 04:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
we've looked at in reference to this i
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
think this thing here is just is
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.600 --> 04:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a number of problems
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
with this but
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest single item was it removes
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature's power to end
 
04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
individual states of emergency
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that's something i know that we on
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
this committee well back in
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
house bill uh
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
514 i think 517 417 sorry was being
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
was something we agreed on and and he
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
seemed to imply that
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
we can end the state of emergency
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
therefore that can be used as a
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
negotiating item to convince the
 
04:23:26.229 --> 04:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
governor not to do certain um
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
emergency orders um a couple problems
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
with that one is he's eliminating the
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that the governor notify the
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
legislature he's going to do the
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in advance anyway
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is you know we had
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the recent state of emergency there
 
04:23:42.560 --> 04:23:43.750 align:start position:0%
in the recent state of emergency there
were

04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
a number of emergency orders that
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
were widely concerning
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
among the people and the legislature
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
but there was a feeling that there was a
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
need for some of the emergency orders
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
given the situation
 
04:23:59.110 --> 04:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
we were
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
unwilling to use the the the big
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
non-uh non-uh a very wide broad hammer
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
basically of ending the entire state of
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
emergency and therefore there really
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't anything we could do about it
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know the points about there being
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
other bills on this and that's all true
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
but that that i think is a tremendous
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
problem with this uh bill thank you
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes president
 
04:24:28.319 --> 04:24:29.269 align:start position:0%
yes president
so

04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote for this bill and in
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
support of
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against the ito
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason is the same reason i
 
04:24:39.840 --> 04:24:41.030 align:start position:0%
and the reason is the same reason i
voted

04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
voted
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
against the original bill last year that
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
put this these words into statute and
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the fact that
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
the original statue in in a way what
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
this returns to
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
lets the house and the senate have a
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution whenever they
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
decide to have one to end a state of
 
04:25:00.479 --> 04:25:02.630 align:start position:0%
decide to have one to end a state of
emergency

04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
rather than making
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
that the two bodies get together every
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
90 days that was my main concern i do
 
04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
agree though that if this were to pass
 
04:25:14.159 --> 04:25:15.189 align:start position:0%
agree though that if this were to pass
that

04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in there also so that
 
04:25:20.239 --> 04:25:20.950 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in there also so that
the

04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
two bodies could address
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency in a specific or a
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
well not then i'll but in that i think
 
04:25:40.229 --> 04:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
that eliminating the specific emergency
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
order is an issue
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
i'm also severely bothered by in section
 
04:25:45.279 --> 04:25:46.070 align:start position:0%
i'm also severely bothered by in section
two

04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
we amended his previous bill
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
and he didn't
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that change and incorporated
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
it in this bill
 
04:25:57.189 --> 04:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
not even bringing us an amendment he
 
04:26:00.149 --> 04:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
said we'll have to fix it and i don't
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
think what else there is in this bill is
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have a comment question
 
04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
what is the difference
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
then the previous bill and this one
 
04:26:16.080 --> 04:26:18.429 align:start position:0%
then the previous bill and this one
please

04:26:18.429 --> 04:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
1037 which is the previous bill is
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
essentially the section two
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
but we amended it to
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
leave in the transparency comment
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
if the first the first section of this
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
so madam chair would you um would you be
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
willing to elaborate just a little bit
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
as to what happens if both of these
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
ah that would depend on
 
04:26:51.439 --> 04:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
ah that would depend on
luck

04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
luck
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
because whichever bill is passed second
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
essentially overwrites the previous
 
04:26:59.600 --> 04:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
essentially overwrites the previous
spill

04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
spill
 
04:27:00.720 --> 04:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
spill
so

04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass both of these
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
we would be relying on luck
 
04:27:06.560 --> 04:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
we would be relying on luck
to

04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
see which of those two
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.439 --> 04:27:22.469 align:start position:0%

representative

04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
i see this i i'm going to use the dread
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
words but i see this in a sense actually
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
is just a cleanup bill there are
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
a variety of ages
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
through the licensing statutes
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
some 18 some 21 i think there's one
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's 17.
 
04:30:52.640 --> 04:30:53.830 align:start position:0%
that's 17.
and

04:30:53.830 --> 04:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
there are other constraints on
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
the age at which somebody can go into
 
04:30:59.590 --> 04:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
any of these things i mean a lot of
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
these have a
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
an education or certification
 
04:31:02.720 --> 04:31:04.149 align:start position:0%
an education or certification
requirement

04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:31:04.159 --> 04:31:04.950 align:start position:0%
requirement
which

04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
impose a practical
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
age restriction there's um
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know some of them you're going to be
 
04:31:12.319 --> 04:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
you know some of them you're going to be
either

04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
being employed by someone or setting up
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
your own business which you
 
04:31:19.110 --> 04:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
can't practically do generally if you're
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
under 18
 
04:31:20.640 --> 04:31:21.510 align:start position:0%
under 18
um

04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
and there's certainly other constraints
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
so i just see putting the ages in here
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
as duplicative
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
um probably the strongest argument that
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
provided was and it's not a common thing
 
04:31:39.030 --> 04:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
but there is the issue of
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
people who are emancipated they're
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
basically under 18 but they are
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
supporting themselves and living
 
04:31:46.710 --> 04:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
basically as an adult
 
04:31:46.720 --> 04:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
basically as an adult
and

04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should have a licensing
 
04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
statute of prohibition against them
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
working although
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
it you know they're probably not going
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to do many if any of these uh
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
these things at that age i just it's
 
04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
partly removing uh duplication there's
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
no need for it in here thank you
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
okay representative bailey do you wish
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
to speak to your second no he doesn't
 
04:32:13.030 --> 04:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone wish to speak
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative pearson and then martian
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i i will be voting against the
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this for a couple of
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
reasons um the primary one being
 
04:32:26.070 --> 04:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
that as as we learned from the sponsor
 
04:32:26.080 --> 04:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
that as as we learned from the sponsor
they're

04:32:27.110 --> 04:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
these folks are still minors and there
 
04:32:29.439 --> 04:32:30.309 align:start position:0%
these folks are still minors and there
is

04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
some serious concerns as to what happens
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
if in the course of their practicing
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:32:39.670 --> 04:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
legal issues lawsuits
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
and and the like when it comes to having
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
someone who's a minor that that's a
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's something that i don't think was
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
cleared up and i i think just leads to
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
some problems the other major part i
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
have on this is in part seven when it
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about age and
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
bodywork therapists and we know there is
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
a long history of abuse and trafficking
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
that surrounds that that industry
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
so the last thing i want to do is
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
provide an avenue for someone who's
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
already a minor
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
to be involved in something that
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
that now becomes permissible under that
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
form of
 
04:33:11.840 --> 04:33:13.189 align:start position:0%
form of
business

04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
so i i just think this is a problem in
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
search of a solution
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
i take that back this is a solution in
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
search of a problem
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
and uh and i i just i i don't think that
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is necessary at all
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman first of all
 
04:33:32.310 --> 04:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to reiterate what
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative pearson says i i agree
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
with him that
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
we don't need to be encouraging
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
the trafficking of minors for illicit
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
activities in the state of new hampshire
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
second of all i will point out that the
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
word occupation is very closely related
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
okay we issue occupational licenses so
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
that people can work
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
we currently have on the books
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
rsa276a which is the child labor law as
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
long as that remains in effect i believe
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill would be inexpedient to
 
04:34:03.840 --> 04:34:05.109 align:start position:0%
that this bill would be inexpedient to
legislate

04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
because it basically would put our
 
04:34:07.279 --> 04:34:08.709 align:start position:0%
because it basically would put our
licensure

04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
requirements in conflict with the child
 
04:34:11.830 --> 04:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
labor law
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i cannot
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
support and not to pass and believe this
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill ought to be itl
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'brien and
 
04:34:20.000 --> 04:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'brien and
then

04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you man i'm sure i couldn't agree
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
more with
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative march i am not going to
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
support the otp i am very concerned
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
about the youth i mean i'm not going to
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
get into you know
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
here we put an age requirement on
 
04:34:37.359 --> 04:34:38.709 align:start position:0%
here we put an age requirement on
smoking

04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
smoking
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
but we're going to allow them to get a
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
license to go out and do your plumbing
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
or to fix your hair or to do something
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
like that and i had too i mean one
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
glowing group that was really missing
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
from this hearing was somebody from the
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
to bring up you know because in my time
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
didn't you need at the age of 16 a
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
workers permit to go out there and work
 
04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
and you tell me think back in your
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
history all your friends
 
04:35:10.869 --> 04:35:10.879 align:start position:0%
who took that i'm only going to take one
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
year off of college
 
04:35:14.629 --> 04:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
but they took that one year off and they
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
made some money and they never went back
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to do how can you get
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
somebody to pay attention to their
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
studies if they have a license
 
04:35:26.000 --> 04:35:27.029 align:start position:0%
studies if they have a license
and

04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
making money then you're throwing their
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
education this is a slippery slope i am
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i agree with everybody starting
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
from representative pearson on
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
so many comments
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
i was kind of surprised
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
to hear some of the reasons
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
put forward by those who are promoting
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
citing the statements made by the
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor i found during the hearing
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
that he did not seem to have very clear
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
answers to a lot of the questions that
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
were put forward to him
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
indicating to me that the bill was not
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
really well thought out at all
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
and my personal feeling is that it
 
04:36:15.039 --> 04:36:16.070 align:start position:0%
and my personal feeling is that it
leaves

04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
young people open to exploitation for
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
particularly things like
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
massage parlors
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason that i will be
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
voting against octopass and
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
instead make this bill itl thank you
 
04:36:33.680 --> 04:36:35.189 align:start position:0%
instead make this bill itl thank you
representatives

04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean uh
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
in my view some of the uh previous
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
comments which i agree with including uh
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien and the one on
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
276a helped make the point that
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
there isn't a need for ages in any of
 
04:36:48.480 --> 04:36:49.269 align:start position:0%
there isn't a need for ages in any of
these

04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
that's covered by other things and it's
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
just duplicative
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and not to belabor
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
the issue but i i do agree with my
 
04:37:01.520 --> 04:37:02.551 align:start position:0%
the issue but i i do agree with my
colleagues

04:37:02.551 --> 04:37:02.561 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
when you talk about child labor laws and
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
some of the other things in there
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
but i also do agree in part on some of
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
these when you have age requirements i'm
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
not sure how many doogie houses new
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire has but when you look at the
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
qualifications needed
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
at 18 years old for licensing
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
qualifications for optometry
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's not too many under 18
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
that can meet those qualifications and
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
that those are there's a few in there
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
where you could actually look at and say
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
do we really need an age limit on them
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
before 18 you're not going to attain
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
those qualifications but when i look at
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
the other ones that we're repealing
 
04:37:41.830 --> 04:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
especially section nine you go right
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
down the list from home inspectors
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
septic system evaluators
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
barber and cosmetology uh pharmacists
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
embalmers occupational therapists and so
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
on and so on um i i think there is an
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
area and a reason to keep minimum age
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
requirements in those occupations and so
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
i will vote against the at the past
 
04:38:02.240 --> 04:38:03.590 align:start position:0%
i will vote against the at the past
representative

04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
well i'll reluctantly support the otp i
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
prefer an interim study to look at these
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
more carefully on a case-by-case basis
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
because the fact is the people who
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
originally proposed these this
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
legislation picked these numbers out of
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
the air
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
there was no thought given to well 18
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
works here 19 works there
 
04:38:26.000 --> 04:38:26.869 align:start position:0%
works here 19 works there
there's

04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
this was just
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
off the shelf uh it's the way we did it
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
the last bill
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
just i'm disturbed by that i would like
 
04:38:38.000 --> 04:38:39.189 align:start position:0%
just i'm disturbed by that i would like
uh

04:38:39.189 --> 04:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
to see
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
more thought given to the bill but to
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
make the statement i will vote for ought
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing is child labor laws that
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
kind of thing this not we're not talking
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
about that's different than licensing
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is whether you're going to work at
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
market basket
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
those laws stay in place there's nothing
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
changed about that and as far as the
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
massage parlors all that criminal
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
activity is a criminal activity it's not
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to change because of licensing
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
crime it's a misdemeanor is a
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor regardless of how
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
whether there's a license involved or
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
not so although i have no particular
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
love for the bill or for the shabby
 
04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
presentation i'll vote for this to make
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
to make the statement i'd like to see
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
somebody actually examine
 
04:39:28.480 --> 04:39:29.429 align:start position:0%
somebody actually examine
whether

04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
ages are really appropriate for these uh
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%

04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh i i think what i said before applies
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is in contradiction to other law
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
and it does not have a place in our
 
04:41:28.718 --> 04:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
and it does not have a place in our
statutes

04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative schuett
 
04:41:32.400 --> 04:41:34.948 align:start position:0%
okay representative schuett
ditto

04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
representatives just um briefly it's i
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't see it as a contradiction but it
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't overrule the other the previous
 
04:41:47.670 --> 04:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
law we're not setting the age at 12 or
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
something it just
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
takes it out of this statute and lets it
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
be dealt with uh
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
through the others thank you
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else wishes
 
04:41:59.190 --> 04:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearson so one of the
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
things thank you madam chair one of the
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
things that happens is that when you
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
when the state issues someone a license
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
to do certain things that it's not an
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
endorsement of their work but it is an
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
endorsement of potentially their
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
ability to do work
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
in in certain areas so
 
04:42:22.948 --> 04:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
i i think it is of concern even though
 
04:42:22.958 --> 04:42:24.390 align:start position:0%
i i think it is of concern even though
potentially

04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes human trafficking and things of that
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
nature are not
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
are not legal certainly
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
but providing licenses for
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
someone in that that's underage that
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
now we're starting to get into the
 
04:42:41.430 --> 04:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
position of being okay with them
 
04:42:44.948 --> 04:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
performing in this world just not
 
04:42:44.958 --> 04:42:46.390 align:start position:0%
performing in this world just not
necessarily

04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
how their performance is going so
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a little bit of an
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
not it's not the word permission but
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
when someone's licensed
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
their what they're doing has been kind
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
of codified by the state and i think
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
that that sends a particularly bad
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative allegra
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
i could echo almost all of the
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
points that i've heard made so far on
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
both sides frankly of the argument
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
we do make a distinction already
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh between
 
04:43:28.320 --> 04:43:29.270 align:start position:0%
uh between
minor

04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
minor
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
those that have not reached the age of
 
04:43:33.030 --> 04:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
majority in those that have
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
in many areas as representative o'brien
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
pointed out smoking and there's voting
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
and there's the draft and there's all
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
sorts of things so i'm not
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
um innately opposed to making that
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
distinction here
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then really just
 
04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative pearson also almost
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
stole my thunder by just
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
pointing out that in the in the very act
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
of licensing and certifying the state or
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
whatever board we're talking about has
 
04:43:59.760 --> 04:44:03.030 align:start position:0%
whatever board we're talking about has
made

04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
using the dictionary lest there be
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the dictionary meaning
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the word discrimination they're
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
making a discriminating determination
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
that people that are 16 17 years old um
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
are highly unlikely to be qualified for
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
performing this duty
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
with that discrimination again the
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
dictionary term
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh with that discrimination
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're putting their um
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
their judgment on the line
 
04:44:36.868 --> 04:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
and so i i again i'm echoing
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's comments
 
04:44:39.200 --> 04:44:41.110 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's comments
it's

04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
are these people truly going to be
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
qualified to perform some of the
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
functions that they're expected to
 
04:44:45.440 --> 04:44:46.868 align:start position:0%
functions that they're expected to
perform

04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
perform
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.150 --> 04:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
senator fellows
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm supporting the ipi tl but i i just
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know maybe there
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
maybe there should should be some kind
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
of minimum age on some of these things
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
and also
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
i think some of these occupations
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
require a criminal background check
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
and so if somebody really wanted to to
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
to attack the
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
age discrimination thing i think they'd
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
have to do a lot more homework because
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
some of them require background checks
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to do that on a on
 
04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
a juvenile i mean you're not going to be
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'll just say then they're not
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to get the license i mean i mean
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
there's many things that would stand in
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
the way of someone
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
who was too young uh getting licensed
 
04:45:48.868 --> 04:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
which is again why i say it's do it's
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
i will mention that when i rewrote some
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
of this when we're amending some of the
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
statutes we should look at the age
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
requirement and see if it's actually
 
04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
necessary in that particular uh
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
and for that particular profession
 
04:46:07.440 --> 04:46:10.310 align:start position:0%
and for that particular profession
because

04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
it must be at least 18 and have a
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
phd is
 
04:46:17.430 --> 04:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
kind of redundant and i believe that's
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
the current requirement for pharmacists
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
all right see
 
04:46:28.628 --> 04:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
