morning everybody it being around
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
10:04 uh we'll start uh the public
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
hearings in transportation but before we
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
do that could we please stand and for
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
Allegiance Al to the flag of the United

States of America and to the Republic
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
for which it stands one nation under God
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
all well good morning everyone just to
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
kind of give everyone a kind of a status
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh chairman Walsh will
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
not be here this morning so I'll be
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
running the hearing so be he'll be here
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
after lunch so this should be a fun time
 
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.909 align:start position:0%
after lunch so this should be a fun time
this

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
morning uh so with that let's start off
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
with our first Bild um HB 249 allowing
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
bicycles to treat stop signs as yield
 
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
signs and stop lights as stop signs in
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
the chair we like to recognize
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh Miller who uh who is
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor of the bill welcome
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
sir thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
good morning uh thank you all for the
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce uh HB 249 here
 
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.749 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce uh HB 249 here
today

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh hb2 249 is an excellent opportunity
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh for uh represent can you just
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself I'm sorry name and
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
who you represent thank you thank you
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry about that uh Seth
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
representative Seth Miller uh straford
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
21 representing do
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
um h249 gives us an excellent
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address uh two major
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
traffic challenges is uh safety and
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
traffic flow on the streets of New
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and best of all it lets us do
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
it for free um we can improve both of
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
those things at no cost to the Grand
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
estate um the idea of what's known as a
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
safety stop uh first was legislated in
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
1982 uh as in Idaho it was known as
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
Idaho stop as a result of that and it
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
allows for uh bicyclists to treat a stop
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
sign as a yield sign uh in Idaho they
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
saw a 14.5% drop in injuries as a result
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
of enacting this law uh 40 years ago and
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers have stayed low since um
 
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
more recently Delaware introduced uh
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
what they call the Delaware yield
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
worried I didn't come up with a cool New
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire related acronym or nickname
 
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
for this but we'll work on that maybe as
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment um Delaware has the
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
Delaware yield uh in 2017 uh research
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
from the nhsa uh or data from the nhsa
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
and other resources shows that they had
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
a 23% drop in accidents at stop sign
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
intersections over the 30 months
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
following that compared to the 30 months
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
prior there there is real data across
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
multiple states that have done this that
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
shows it is massively safer for
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
cyclists um I will point out that most
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
importantly uh two things one it is
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
still optional cyclists who want to stop
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
or need to stop or should stop will stop
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
or at least should um and they you still
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
must yield uh this is not that you just
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
get a green light at any stop sign this
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
is it is a yield sign you are still
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
expected to pay attention to the laws of
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
the road and yield to Crossing traffic
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
where appropriate the the main focus
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
here is keeping cyclists moving even at
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
very low speeds and for some of you who
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
may not have ridden a bike in a while
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
but may you know I'd like to think we
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
all did at some point at least as a kid
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
um that first few seconds getting off
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
the ground when you pick your foot up
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
and you start moving forward you're
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
wobbly you're moving at one or 2 miles
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
an hour that wobble there uh it's a
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
slower portion of the ride you're much
 
00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
less safe you're much less in control
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
once you get moving you get a couple
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
miles per hour under you you're you're
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
rolling that's where you have the
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
balance that's where you have control of
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
your bicycle and so what this bill does
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
is by making it a yield sign you
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
maintain that speed you don't
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to drop below the 3 to
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
five miles an hour and get into that
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
wobble State on your bike unless of
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
course cross traffic or other reasons
 
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
that you need to actually stop while
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
you're yielding um the other thing that
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
it does is helps traffic flow and it's
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
important to note that because the
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
cyclist is not coming to a Full Stop um
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
they they move through the intersection
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
more quickly again a a car uh anything
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
motorized 0o to 5 miles hour is pretty
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
easy you tap the pedal you move uh a
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
cyclist it's especially if you're on a
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
heavier bike um with Cargo in it or
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
things like that you're self-powered you
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
have to get that moving up to the 3 to 5
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
m an hour to get things moving so the
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
car behind you can roll to the stop sign
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
perform its stop and then move forward
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
again we by moving the bicycle go
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
through that intersection more quickly
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the cars behind it can also flow more
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
quickly so it's a smoother flow of
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
traffic for vehicles as well um and one
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
other thing I will point out I know we
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
did have a hearing about Lane filtering
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
and motorcycles recently and we had so
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
we have had some discussion about this
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
type of thing uh in the past couple
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
weeks this is has substantially
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
differences from the lane filtering
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
approach most notably uh cyclists are
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
not weaving between the cars to get up
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
to the front of traffic they are still
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
within their step you know sort of their
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
cycle of how things flow it's just a
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
matter of when they get there they can
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
move through the intersection more
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
quickly and safely for everybody um with
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
that uh I will note that I think
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
everybody has received emails at least
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
two or three times with the nhsa uh uh
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
research data on it if you haven't I
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
will for your copy I chose not to print
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
30 copies of it because I didn't think
 
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
we need them but if anyone wants a hard
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
copy let me know um and with that I
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions
 
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.829 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions
from

00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much any questions
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you Mr thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Miller for
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
taking the question the only thing I see
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
that's different in here um
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
from regular moving traffic is on line
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
21 it says a leftand turn onto a one-way
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
High way may be made on on a red light
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
after stopping and yielding to other
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
traffic could you explain why you you
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
put that in
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
there um thank you yeah I should
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
probably have a copy of this in front of
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
me to make sure I get it right but um I
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
believe that's from the stop uh is that
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
is that a red light yeah so there I
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
should note there's two halves of the uh
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
the Idaho stop is considered a stop
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
light soon a stop sign situation there's
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
also the uh treating a red light as a
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
stop sign um that goes back to the idea
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
that again when yielding appropriately a
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
bicycle often is not doesn't have the
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
weight or magnetic signature to trigger
 
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
a a lane detection signal so if you're
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
at a left turn lane often times those
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
have the little wires in the ground or I
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire we use the cameras
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
now for a lot of those things but if you
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
don't trigger that the idea is you can
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
sit and wait and wait and wait and you
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
could theoretically be stuck there
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
forever until a car comes up behind you
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
to help uh S turn that signal for you
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
um so again this allows for when safe to
 
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
be able to make that left turn onto the
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
road I believe you want to follow
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
up follow
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
up so I do recall a bill similar to that
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
for motorcyclist and I believe do U
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
testified that a red light the longest
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're ever going to sit at a red light
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
is 120 seconds is that still
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
did did do I mean I guess I'd ask do I
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
know do is going to be speaking later
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're can have them clarify that ask
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
that question then thank you you get a
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
hint of what you're going to get
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
congratulations representative
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
pataro thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question are you a
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
cyclist yes okay follow up
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
followup um I imagine within the cycling
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
Community there are different like
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
levels of skill in one sense you have
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
hobbyists and another sense you have the
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
people with the
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
um the the gear and and the the the
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
shoes that like plug into the pedals yep
 
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.910 align:start position:0%
shoes that like plug into the pedals yep
right

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
um would you say that PE bicyclists at
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
all levels um are in favor of of this
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
bill no like anything else I think
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of opinions on the
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill and where you know the law should
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
be um again I will remind you that as I
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony there is no
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
requirement that a cyclist roll through
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
a stop sign when if this is enacted you
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
still can stop um you are encouraged to
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
act and behave in a way that is
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
considered safe both for you and the
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
other traffic around you and so for if
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
you are comfortable stopping a full stop
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
there that is complet okay uh thank you
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair can I ask one more question
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
all up okay um the language added in
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
this bill talks about not just bicycles
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
but human powerered vehicles and
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
electric bicycles um could you elaborate
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
on what what those mean what those are
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh under New Hampshire law electric
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
bicycle is a specific classification of
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
bicycle um and is treated almost
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
universally the same as a manual powered
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
bicycle um and so that inclusion here is
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's clear that it
 
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
applies to both of those categories and
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
so um there's a whole section of the RSA
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
about electric bikes and notes that they
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
are basically bikes um human powered
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles could be
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
other things that are not the
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
traditional two wheels with a frame in
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
between a trike um that is wheel
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
powerered or electric uh but is more
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
like a bicycle than anything else
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
there's those cool like ski things that
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
you sort of push your pedals on that
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
moves but it's sort of thing it's those
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
types of vehicles um and again that that
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
is that was included based on best
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
practices from other states that have
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
done similar things to make sure we are
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing the types of vehicles that
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
we would expect to be able to take
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
advantage of this law excellent answer
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much y representative
 
00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:09.799 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman um like any
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
of these uh changes uh my concern
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
is not knowing what when I when I come
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
to an intersection and traffic is
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
stopped on either side I don't know I
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
need to know what those people are going
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
to do here it sounds like I would not
 
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
know what that bicyclist is going to do
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
whether because it's voluntary whether
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
they are going to continue on and and
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
say that they are U not yielding they're
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
going through the stop sign or whether
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
they are stopping
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
so how can you speak to the uncertainty
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the person that is coming to that
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
intersection and and seeing bicyclists
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
approaching and not knowing what what
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
the bicyclist plans to do sure um
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
I am not in the brain of all those
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
bicyclists so I will speak to it from
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
you know or of all the drivers but my my
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
understanding my expectation would be
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
that when I am approaching an
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
intersection and a a cyclist is
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
approaching from the other side and
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
let's assume we both have stop signs or
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's a four-way stop something of that
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
nature um the cyclists would still
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
respect the fact that they have to yield
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
if there is cross traffic and would
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise apply the sort of rules of who
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
has right of way when multiple Vehicles
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
approach a stop at the same time so if I
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
am to your right on a bicycle and you
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
are coming up and we both get there at
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
the same time I would have right of way
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
whether I came to a full stop or treated
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
that stop sign as a yield because that
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
is what the rules of the road say if you
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
are to my right and I we are coming up
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
you have the right of way and as
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
specified in the law I am obligated to
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
yield to you as we approach at the same
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
time and that sucks for me because I
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
lose my momentum and have to stop and go
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
through you know the wobble phase and
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
all those other things again but I would
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
expect that that is how the law is
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
written that is how it continues to be
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
written with this uh Amendment or this
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
alteration of the law and that's how it
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
would be adhered
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
to representative gon thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Miller
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question so you I've reviewed
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of laws similar to this in the
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
motorcycle world the left turn on red
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
the lane filtering Etc and all those
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
laws specifically state State somewhere
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
that the operator that is doing
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
something non-standard is liable for
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
damages for their own safety and and
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
establishes that this this new code of
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
law does not change the laws of right
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
away I don't see anything with regards
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
to liability in this and that concerns
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
me do you know if that's covered under
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
another code of law or what your answer
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
to that is Sir uh thank you for the
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
question I do not know if that's covered
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
specifically elsewhere um on the laws uh
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I I don't believe that there is
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
specific uh mention of who has liability
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
when a cyclist is on the road generally
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
um other than they are obligated to
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
respect the laws of the road and so um
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say terrible thing I would
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
assume terrible mistake to make that uh
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
th if this is the law and the uh this it
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
is I would say this doesn't this makes
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
it so it's non-standard in that bikes
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
are treated differently than Motor
 
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.350 align:start position:0%
are treated differently than Motor
Vehicles

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
Vehicles
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
but it is standard in that it is the law
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
and so a cyclist who does not yield when
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
they should is still liable just as if
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
they ran a stop sign today and should
 
00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:43.909 align:start position:0%
they ran a stop sign today and should
have

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
yielded is that
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
fair and I will offer if you if we
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
discover that it needs more in an
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that says that adds that line
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
to it would make you feel more
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable I'd be happy to entertain
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we can talk about that in a bit
 
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
that we can talk about that in a bit
representative

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
emble uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
you representative Miller uh so I'm glad
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the lane filtering bill
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
that we recently discussed and if I
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
remember correctly uh it was
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly itl in this committee
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
because it was creating a special class
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
of vehicle with their own laws and we
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
felt that people in general were not
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
used to a a special class of vehicles
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
with special laws that they could um do
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
that nobody else could do and so the
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee voted itl on it um so how is
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill not creating a special class
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
of vehicles that get to operate by their
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
own laws that everybody else has not
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
been trained in uh as to how they're
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
operate uh thank you for the question I
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
can't speak to I I agree that we all
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
ited uh we voted overwhelming itl the
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
lane filtering uh Bill I'm not sure the
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
reasoning all of us chose so I'm but uh
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
taking to to your point of different
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
types of rules for different types of
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles um there are different rules
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
for different types of vehicles we all
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
we all agree on many of them and it
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
behaves similarly but um how cyclists
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to behave in a lane and where
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to ride and things like
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
that are different than Motor Vehicles
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
so there there are already differences
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
in how motor vehicles and cyclists um um
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
are treated on the roads and how they're
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
expected to behave in certain scenarios
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh so I I understand the concern that oh
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
gosh I didn't know that bike was going
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
to only was going to roll through that
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
stop sign uh with the exception of the
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
scenario where you are a vehicle behind
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
that bicycle and you get to the stop
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
sign faster my expectation is you would
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
never experience that because otherwise
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
you are cross traffic and the bicyclist
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
is still going to yield to you so yes
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's a situation where they are
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
operating differently that is on purpose
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
because there's value in having giving
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
them the ability to operate differently
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
both for safety and for traffic flow and
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
the people who will notice it the only
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
notice they should have is the advantage
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
they get of moving through traffic more
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you any other questions
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you very much chair I'd
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
like to recognize Michael Frank who's
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
representing himself who supports the
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill who's asking for two to three
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
Transportation good
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is Michael Frank I
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
live in spafford New
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm an avid long-term cyclist
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
I teach cycling safety as a league
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
cycling instructor
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to support hille
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
249 my home is 8 to 10 miles from the
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
retail centers of keen New Hampshire and
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro Vermont I commute regularly
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
by bicycle into these centers for
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
shopping and errands typically riding a
 
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
cargo bike which is designed to uh carry
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
large loads large heavy
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
loads it's not uncommon for my neighbors
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
to see me climbing Chesterfield Hill
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
with two three weeks of groceries on the
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
back of that
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
bicycle I only tell you this to showcase
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
the how this bill
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
can benefit me personally and my
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
safety when I bring my heavily loaded
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
bicycle to a full stop at a stop sign it
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
takes a great deal of effort to get that
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
bike rolling again and up to speed at
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
leaves me in the intersection longer and
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
it exposes me to Cross traffic
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
as well as the traffic who's coming up
 
00:25:00.919 --> 00:25:04.470 align:start position:0%
as well as the traffic who's coming up
behind

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
me if on the other hand I'm allowed to
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
slow as I approach the intersection
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
yield to any on any cross traffic and
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
then maintain my momentum I'm through
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
the intersection quicker and have less
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
exposure because I'm fully integrated
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
with the environment as I'm writing I
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
have an acute awareness of traffic
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
around me I have an unobstructed view of
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
what's surrounding me I have I can hear
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles coming from all quadrants and
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
indeed there are sometimes that I can
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
smell a vehicle a car or a truck coming
 
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.710 align:start position:0%
smell a vehicle a car or a truck coming
towards

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
towards
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
me so I'm exquisitly aware of the
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
dangers that are approaching me from any
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
of those uh angles in an intersection so
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
as I approach that intersection if it's
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
unsafe for me to proceed through I'm
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to slow and
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
stop just as a motorist treats a yield
 
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.830 align:start position:0%
stop just as a motorist treats a yield
sign

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
sign
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
by processing the information of whether
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
to slow and proceed through or stop for
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
the any oncoming traffic I'm able to do
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
that at an intersection controlled by a
 
00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
that at an intersection controlled by a
red

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
red
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
octagon now this bill also calls for
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
allowance of the cyclist to treat a stop
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
light as a stop sign and I'd like to
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
speak to my personal experience with
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
that I frequently find myself at the
 
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.909 align:start position:0%
that I frequently find myself at the
stop

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
line waiting for a red light as I'm in
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
the right hand
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
lane getting ready to proceed straight
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
through that intersection whenever the
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
light turns green for years I've had to
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
endure the Wrath of the motorist behind
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
me who wants to make a right-and turn on
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
a red light but I'm waiting there
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
waiting for that light to turn green as
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
he and I
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
stare at an empty
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
intersection if I have the ability to
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
pull up to the stoplight make sure that
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
there's no traffic coming and then
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
proceed through that allows me to get
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
through the intersection the traffic
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
behind me to make their right unre
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
privilege exercise that privilege if the
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
traffic behind me is going to follow me
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
straight through that that intersection
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
it allows me to get up to speed get some
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
space between the tra the vehicle behind
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
me and through the intersection and that
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
allows that driver the opportunity to
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
time his move to the left to get around
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
me these are all things that make my
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
life as a cyclist much more safer and
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
improves site vehicle flow traffic
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
flow I can Echo the prior testimony of
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
improved safety I can site the various
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
studies showing no negative impact on
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
the motoring public and I can point out
 
00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:58.149 align:start position:0%
the motoring public and I can point out
that

00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
izing a common practice has in other
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
states caused an increase in cycling for
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
health and
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
Recreation but in my reading I can't
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
find any evidence that this law would
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
cause any expense to the state for these
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
reasons I respectfully ask you support
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
this legislation I thank you for your
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
time and consideration and I would
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
invite you to come down and ride around
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
spafford Lake with me
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
anytime any questions from the committee
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank you Mr
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you are you aware of any
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
bicyclists yourself included but
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
probably not you that have uh received a
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
ticket for um treating a red light as a
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
stop sign or coasting through a stop
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
sign or a traffic light on a bicy I can
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
speak to my my personal experience I
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
have not received a ticket I have uh had
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
an a discussion with an officer in
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.590 align:start position:0%
an a discussion with an officer in
another

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
State um and I've had one state police
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
officer flash his lights at me just to
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
indicate that uh he knew that I'd roll
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
through the stop sign
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions from
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
the committee not seeing any thank you
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
sir thank you chair i' like to recognize
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
Tim blagden who supports the bill asking
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
for two
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
transportation thank you very very much
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
um I was the head of the bike walk
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
Alliance of New Hampshire from 2013 to
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
2016 I support the bill um this bill
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
reflects how um many people ride today
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
um we're all out um to keep ourselves
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
safe but um starting and stopping on a
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
bicycle takes effort and so if we can
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
approach a stop sign slow look around
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
and if it and if it's safe to do so
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
proceed that saves energy and saves time
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
and as previous people have testified it
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
also gets the the bicycle through the
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
intersection faster which is safer for
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
all of us um both on bikes and on cars
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
and similarly at a stop sign you if this
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
law were passed this the cyclist would
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to come to a complete stop at a red
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
light but if the intersection is empty
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
um of cross traffic it would be safe for
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
the it would be permissible for the
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
cyclist to then go through that uh empty
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
intersection where the red light is
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
there and uh we know that um signal
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
equipment is non-responsive in most
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
cases to bicyclists um motorcyclists
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
have the same uh reaction from the
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
equipment from time to time they put big
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
metal uh plugs on on the bottom of their
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
motorcycle so that they can trigger um
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
stop lights uh and occasionally at
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
certain intersections um cycling groups
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
have have uh stencl where to position a
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
bicycle so that the street light will
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
react to them but in the vast majority
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
of intersections street lights are
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
non-functioning to bicycles so this
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
allows a cyclist when it's safe to do so
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
to proceed through an intersection it's
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
it's good legislation it's what um I I
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
urge you all to support it happy to take
 
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.070 align:start position:0%
urge you all to support it happy to take
any

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:23.990 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative Fox thank you
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
question can you imagine in any scenario
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
a a bicyclist blowing through a busy
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
intersection just because
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
they of this law can I because of this
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
law no um Can can I
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
imag drivers of cars and and drivers of
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
bicycles all come from the same gene
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
pool there are some crazy folks out
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
there but um you know it is all us so if
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't do it and I wouldn't do it
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
no one should do
 
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:06.519 align:start position:0%
it representative s Clair thank you Mr
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you I'll ask you the same
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of anybody in the
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that's received a
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
ticket on a bicycle for treating a stop
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
sign as a yield sign or a traffic uh red
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
light I am not I think that would be um
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
better put to the office of Highway
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
Safety or the state police um
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I know what the law
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
is and I don't look forward to Breaking
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
the Law so it the law as as written
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
today you do have to come to a full stop
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
and if you if you don't you're you're
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
breaking the law so you're looking in
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
both directions and making sure that
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's really empty and there's no cop
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
there it's a disincentive to get on a
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
bike and uh and this proposed law um
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
serves as an incentive it makes it
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
easier to do a journey on a bike through
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
intersections that either have stop
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
signs or lights and whether or not you
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
ride a bicycle you want as many people
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
as possible riding bikes because the
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
number of parking spaces we have in our
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
downtowns is limited if we want more
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
economic business to happen in those
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
areas and we all
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
do you can put 20 bikes in the same
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
space as a single parking spot so the
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
more people we can get to bike to those
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
destinations for that lunch or for that
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
errand the better we all are they're not
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
going to be taking the spot you and I
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
want when we're driving a car because
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
they're riding a bike and we're going to
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
get there first for the same reason
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
so we should love those folks for riding
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
a bike because the spots empty the
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
table's going to be empty if you and I
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
are having lunch together and they're
 
00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
still going to get there and support
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
those businesses so I for there's a lot
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
of reasons I want to see more people
 
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.350 align:start position:0%
of reasons I want to see more people
riding

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
riding
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
bikes thank you any other questions from
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
the committee represent the pill thank
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I should have asked
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
earlier uh to the prime sponsor is there
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
um is there any age limit on
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
this are are I five year olds able to
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
make that same um
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh process of D of using it as a yield
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
sign as a as a 35 year old so um
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
I have a 35-year-old son I have
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
5-year-old grandchildren and and um as a
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
as a parent I'm not dodging the question
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
the law does not have any age in in it
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay but as a parent um of a minor you
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
are responsible for their actions um I
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
do everything I can to make cycling
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
safer um and and more available to
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
people of all ages so I work for two org
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
or volunteer at two organizations that
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
have given bicycles to 13 elementary
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
schools and they're teaching
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners and first graders how to
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
ride bikes so it's not a theoretical
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
question that these kids who are five
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
six and seven are going to know how to
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
ride a bike but we do it because we're
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
building rail trails and think that
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
parents are going to take those kids out
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
for more practice on rail trails and
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
learn how to stop start and navigate on
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
a bike in a safe place before they
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
tackle any Street
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
so do I would I encourage somebody to
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
turn a 5-year-old loose on the streets
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
no would I expect to see someone who is
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
12 or above riding a bicycle on a street
 
00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:43.950 align:start position:0%
12 or above riding a bicycle on a street
I

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
would and I would expect them to follow
 
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.470 align:start position:0%
would and I would expect them to follow
the

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
laws any other questions from the
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative pauo thank you
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
very very much and thank you for taking
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
my question I imagine the next years and
 
00:35:57.319 --> 00:35:58.390 align:start position:0%
my question I imagine the next years and
decades

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
decades
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire might have specific areas
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
of urbanization and development and so
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
forth and with that comes bike Lanes do
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on how this bill
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
cities um if you look at
 
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.589 align:start position:0%
cities um if you look at
Transportation

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
um guide books isn't the wrong
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
standardization books and we have dot
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
here we have other people from cycling
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
organizations here so
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
um there are um there is infrastructure
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
techniques where if you have a bike lane
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
that comes up to an intersection and
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
then and it's heavily biked in a in a
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
place they can do a bike box at the
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
front of the intersection to allow the
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
bikes to move up and then get the jump
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the intersection I
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the state of New
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has any of those here um yet
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
but there are ways to handle smoothly
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
more bicycling if if that's what you're
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
asking but honestly we are a long way
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
away from having that problem we would
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's a problem I would love to have um
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
so we need to make biking safer uh in in
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
many places first I appreciate it very
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you any other questions from
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
the committee not seeing any thank you
 
00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:21.390 align:start position:0%
the committee not seeing any thank you
very

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
much just to let the members of the
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
committee know we do have the dot here
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
as one of the speakers so um
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you have some specific
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions there they'll be up here
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
shortly uh next chair I like to
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
recognize Paula Bard representing
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
herself asking for three minutes who
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and also has written
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
testimony if uh you have that give it to
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
the clerk we'd appreciate it welcome yep

thank you my name is Paula Bard I live
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
in Goffstown I'm here to speak in favor
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
of hb2 49 if passed it would allow
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
and stop lights as stop signs I've been
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
an avid bicyclist most of my life I
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate and value using a bicycle for
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
transportation Recreation and fitness um
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
as a transportational cyclist I commuted
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
to work by bike for many years I'm also
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
a certified bike safety instructor I
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
have my certification through the
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
national level League of American
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
bicyclist credential um they have a
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
smart cycling program uh and I've been
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
involved in teaching those curriculums
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
for over 15 years in my role as a bike
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
safety instructor I have been hired in
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
the past by organizations such as
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
Harvard University and Cambridge Mass
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College in Handover New
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire L University um and I've also
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
hosted many presentations on safe
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
cycling bike commuting ebikes bike
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
friendly driving which is a class that
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
educates Motor Vehicle drivers on safe
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
behaviors and laws when sharing roadways
 
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.990 align:start position:0%
behaviors and laws when sharing roadways
with

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
bicyclists um in the past I've also
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
served on the New Hampshire Traffic
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
Safety commission and on several other
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
advocacy organizations serving as the
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
voice for bicyclists and pedestrian
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
rights responsibilities and safety
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
issues I'm in favor of HB 249 because it
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
increases bicycle safety and it allows
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
them to move through intersections and
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
away from congested traffic more quickly
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
for many decades now our traffic Studies
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
have consistently shown that
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
intersections are one of the most
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous locations for bicyclists they
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
are considered uh highrisk areas okay
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
the studies on locations that have
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
implemented the stop on yield uh this
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
law have indicated the increase in
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
bicyclist safety and I'd like to quote
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
from the Nitsa National Highway trans
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
ation safety administration's 2023 fact
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
sheet on this behavior and this is from
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
Nitsa based upon the current research
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
and data available these laws showed
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
added safety benefits for bicyclists
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
happy to take any uh questions if there
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
are any and thank you for the
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak in favor of this
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
bill any questions from the committee
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes and thank you and
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes my question is the same are you
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
aware of anybody in the state of New
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire excuse me who has received the
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
traffic ticket for yes I I have a couple
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
of friends over the year people I know I
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
should say I have it's rare but I have
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
heard of instances and I know people
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
that have been cited by Lo local law
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement for infringements you know
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
and um I'm sure the issue is that um
 
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.150 align:start position:0%
and um I'm sure the issue is that um
primarily

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
a cyclist blowing through a traffic uh
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh intersection they're primarily
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
endangering themselves certainly not in
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
all cases but that is you know they're
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
mostly a danger to themselves but I do
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
know people that have been uh cited for
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
those types of
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
infractions thank you any other
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
any thank you I'm so sorry
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative Peto thank you real quick
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm sorry I missed it uh could you

d um followup follow up um you you seem
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
very professional on this subject do you

currently work for a bicycling
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%

information I'm here speaking um on my
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
own I sort of semi-retired recently from
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
all the ad advocacy work that I have
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
been doing but I've been passionate
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
about safety issues for bicyclists and
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
pedestrians for decades um and I I don't
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
think I'll ever fully quit uh doing
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
advocacy um we live in such a car
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
Centric society that there needs to be
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
push back for people who want to bike
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
and walk in our communities and do it
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
safely thank you any other questions
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
you so much and if we can have the
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
written test Tony that'll be great and
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
give it to the
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
clerk chair El recognize representative

Reed who has want two minutes who
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
supports the bill welcome thank you Mr
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable members I wasn't
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
planning on testifying for the record my
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 new Mark and newfields and
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
having to sit through the end waiting
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
for my bill I just thought I'd give an
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
assist to my two- wielded Brethren and
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
sister uh who are supporting this bill
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason I want because I have
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
come to talk to you about a different
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
bill which I won't try to conflate that
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
has to do with the behavior of two-
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
wheeled vehicles on the road um and I
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
find the same logical fallacy consisting
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
consistent through these different
 
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
hearings and that that fallacy is that
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
um this would somehow make the people
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
who are already engaging in illegal
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
Behavior do that illegal Behavior more
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
illegally and that's just not true if
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
people are running through red lights
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
now they're going to continue in the
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
future if they're engaged in Drag Racing
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
now they're going to continue in the
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
future so I don't I just want to caution
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
the committee before they engage in
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
debate that has to do with that logical
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
fallacy and I would like to also remind
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
the committee that people on two wheels
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
whether they be um powered or not
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
powered are doing a service to society
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so that kind of you want to
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
encourage that behavior especially with
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
bicycles um because they are helping
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
with traffic they are helping with theem
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
missions they are helping with um all
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
the things that we want people to to
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
help out with and so to incentivize that
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
would be to um help them transport
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
themselves in a safe way and having said
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to say that I ride a
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
bicycle every day I don't I have a a
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
body built by motorcycles so um I don't
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
think that there would be questions but
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of someone being
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh ticketed okay but again I'm not a
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
bicyclist I'm a vom vom thank you any
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
any thank
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
you here like now like to recognize
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Vale representing himself who
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
so supports the bill who's asking for
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
five minutes if we could make it like
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
two to three we appreciate it uh yes sir
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me uh first time
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
here that's why I put five minutes I
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
didn't know what that would be so we'll
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
make it real quick I think uh people
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
have addressed the major points that I
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
came here to make so I just want to add
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
that uh my name is Jonathan Bale I'm
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
from nsha where I'm involved with the
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
gate City Bike Co-op uh the
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
Nash uh strong towns group and I'm also
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
a member of the bike walk Alliance of
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I'm also a longtime
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
bike commuter uh recreational cyclist uh
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
and I commute year round uh plus or
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
minus snow to uh where I work in marac
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
um and on that drive I do go
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
through mostly some uh red lights uh
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
some of them uh as you say where I'm
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
taking blocking cars from getting
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
through uh in terms of waiting for the
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
red light when there's no other traffic
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
it would be beneficial to everybody to
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
go through safely uh and then allow the
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
cars to go through quicker when the
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
light changes uh I've also been a victim
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
of uh the dead Reds where you come up to
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
a red light and it doesn't change and
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
then you have to make the decision to go
 
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.470 align:start position:0%
then you have to make the decision to go
through

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
anyway um to uh the question of have I
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
been ticketed I have not I've witnessed
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
um uh some kid getting pulled over for
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
doing something dumb I don't know if he
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
got ticketed either but um I don't know
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
if anybody who actually got ticketed in
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um I think uh
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the points that I
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
came here to make uh in addition to the
 
00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
ones that were there I'm happy to answer
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
any questions and appreciate your time
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you sir
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
okay I like to recognize Bill Lambert
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
and Jerry
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
Bard who uh from the and New Hampshire
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
dot who do not have any position in the
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
bill asking for five to 10 sir if you
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
can make it a little bit shorter we'll
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
put behind appreciate it thank
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and members of
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record uh my name
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
is Bill Lambert I'm the highway safety
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
active Transportation administrator for
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation I have
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
with me today my colleague Jerry Bard
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
who's our active Transportation
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
administrator we pretty much represent
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
the the the scope or the span of bicycle
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
experience I have a bike in the garage I
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
tend to take it on vacation and ride
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
some early morning rides along very
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
rural roads Jerry commutes to work all
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
year round on his bicycle um so we
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
represent that gamut so representative
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
Crawford had asked about cycle length uh
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
so traffic signal cycle length is
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
usually going to be the maximum of 120
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
seconds so if you're on the main road
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
the major road you're likely to return
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
to that green light at no more than 120
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
seconds but if you're left turning off
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
the main road or entering from a minor
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
Road uh and the detection is not picking
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
you up you could be there indefinitely
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
just because you're not going to get
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
picked up so the cycle length maximum is
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
120 seconds but that only means that the
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
main road is going to rest red if
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
there's no traffic on the road it's
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
going to come back to that main rest
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
green it's going to come back to that
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
green light but the the side roads and
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
the left turns off the main road uh have
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
to be detected and if that detection is
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
not functioning or if it doesn't pick up
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
the vehicle it could be a while and I
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
think representative Miller mentioned
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
the um the newer signals have cameras we
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
do have video detection on some of the
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
the newer ones um but 450 or so signals
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's a long time before we have full
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
coverage of that uh around the state um
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
I'm here mostly to answer questions
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
those are the two that I caught from the
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony but I'd be happy to
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions thank you sir
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative J gason thank you Mr
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you sir so uh one of my
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
questions was that there's no liability
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
um written into this law and based on
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
your expertise um should I be worried
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
about that or is that liability written
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
into other laws and what I mean by that
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
is if a if a bicycle takes the
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
initiative to go into a live
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
intersection and they misjudge it who's
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
liable for that collision and where is
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
it codified into law thank you for the
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
question uh I work a lot with lawyers
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
and on the defense side but I'm not a
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer so that's that's not a question
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
that I'd be comfortable answering uh I
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
deal with the rules of the road and the
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure SES
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee pres of St Clair thank you Mr
 
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
chair you know my question any any
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge of uh
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
ticketing going on or strong
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement U for
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
bicycles coasting through I should have
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
answered that when I started but uh no I
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
am not aware I've never been ticketed um
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm not aware of any enforcement of
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
that I think it like people have
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
testified I think it's pretty common
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
practice for bicyclist and um and others
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
that when they recognize they're an
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
intersection and and they're not getting
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
a green light um or there's no traffic
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
that they they'll pass through thank you
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
emblem uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking that questions um so we
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
had a bill on motorcycle Lane filtering
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
currently uh at intersections where
 
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
there were no designated bike lane uh
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
bicycles allowed to do that same Lane
 
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
filtering technique or do they have to
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I'd have
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
to look through the rules of the road
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that they're allowed to do
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
that I I see that fairly frequently um
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
I've been in a bite coming up to it to
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
signalize intersection where it's
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to be in the queue uh and
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
I I would tend to be to the side one way
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
or the other um but I'm not sure what
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
the what the rules of the road would say
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
on that thank you any other questions
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
 
00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
you

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
sir with that I do not have any other
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
pink cards but before I close off this
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
hearing just want to let everyone know
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
online we had 37 people who voted to
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
support this bill and seven who opposed
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
it so just to kind of give you a note on
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
that so with that I'm going to close the
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
249 next up will be HP 411 just give us
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
all right we're falling a little bit
 
00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
behind here so we got to get get
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
moving like to
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 411 relative to making the
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
use of a mobile electronic device while
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
driving a secondary offense Cher like to
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Reed the prime
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor welcome thank you again Mr chair
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you again honorable members um
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
again for the record I am still Ellen
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
Reed I still represent Rockingham 10 new
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
market and newfields and as I've
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
testified in this committee before for
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
the context for the following bill um
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
among my many professions I've had in my
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
life the one I currently hold and I've
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
held for the last 14 years is that of a
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
CDL driver of large Vehicles interstate
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
and um in the 14 years I've helped that
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
license I have driven approximately 1
 
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.750 align:start position:0%
license I have driven approximately 1
million

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
miles so as you are probably aware a
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
recent Supreme Court decision just
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
struck down at least part of our current
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
um handsfree law as overly Broad and not
 
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
really enforceable and unfair
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
um the way that the opinion as I read it
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
is directing is that it's unfair because
 
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.390 align:start position:0%
is directing is that it's unfair because
essentially

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
this is no different than this and yet
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
for some reason this is illegal and puts
 
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
points on your license and this does
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
not not that distracted driving which is
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
not illegal in and of itself the only
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
place in uh motor vehicle law where the
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
word distracted pops up is in the test
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
that we have to take to get our license
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
where we have to answer questions about
 
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.750 align:start position:0%
where we have to answer questions about
distracted

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
distracted
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
driving um but it's not that they're
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
saying that it's okay to distracted on
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
your phone they're saying that if you're
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
not doing something with your phone
 
00:54:30.839 --> 00:54:31.910 align:start position:0%
not doing something with your phone
that's

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
distracting and wouldn't be distracting
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
in any other context then that's not
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
enforcable um and so this mandates that
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
the law be changed now I understand why
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
the current law was written the way it
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
is because as I recall there were many
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
iterations trying to get to what would
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
be problematic behavior on your phone
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
and I remember things like well what you
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
know pressing a one button on your phone
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
more than once every 30 seconds and
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
obviously an officer cannot possibly
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
witness that level of detail with
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
operating the phone I mean I guess it's
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
possible but it's highly unlikely be
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
very difficult to enforce and so I think
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
the easiest thing for back then 10 years
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
ago for this committee to do was to
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
Simply say handsfree don't touch your
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
any device that can connect um
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh while you are
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
driving however um that's not that we
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
know now and I think the Supreme Court
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
has affirmed the intent of this bill
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
which is that is really unfair because I
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
could hold a phone shaped toy and that
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be fine I could do that to my face
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that would be fine I can eat my
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
breakfast I can put on my makeup in the
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
mirror which would be way worse than
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
and I have one of the largest phones on
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
the market and yet um the way our law is
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
is that that that is not distracted
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
driving and that is so this is what the
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said I did not have
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
foresight to know how they would decide
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
the case um relative to our former
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
colleague um but I think that the point
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
is that the this bill I think is an
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
elegant way to get around the idea that
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
you need to tie the behavior to being
 
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.190 align:start position:0%
you need to tie the behavior to being
actually

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
distracted um without creating all of
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
those enforcement problems of a officer
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
has to see you actually pushing a thing
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
or whatever um because by making it a
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
secondary offense only it has to be tied
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
to some other illegal Behavior whether
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's swerving following too closely
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
erratic driving speeding your lights
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
aren't on whatever it is this I think
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
gives office officers a lot of leeway to
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
say okay you're doing something that you
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing and also I saw you
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
potentially distracted and so now you
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
can connect that behavior having said
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
that if this committee decides that um
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
you need to clean that up you now have a
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
really convenient um timely uh
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
applicable vehicle for amending the
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
current law so um yeah I realize that
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
there are um representatives of our fine
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers here uh ready
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
to tell you this would be exceedingly
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
dangerous and people will die and all of
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
those things and I will just say what I
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
said just a few minutes ago which is the
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
people are already doing the illegal
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
behaviors we aren't adequately
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
describing behaviors that people are
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in currently and the Supreme
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
Court has affirmed that so people are
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
already on their phone everybody is
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
seeing people on their
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
phone uh people are already getting
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
tickets for being on their phone whether
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
they're just holding a dead phone or um
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know holding something up to their
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
ear or actually texting which would be
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
the actual problematic Behavior right um
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're already doing that I think we
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
know now we have a mandate from the
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to tighten up our law and
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think this allows officers to easily
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
enforce while still connecting it to the
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
actual distracted
 
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.390 align:start position:0%
actual distracted
driving

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
um I think oh I did want to say in the
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
interest stuff if in case you wanted to
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
talk about distracted driving which is
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
not currently its own RSA um the
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
National Highway Traffic and safety
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
administration defines distracted
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
driving is taking your eyes off the road
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
for two seconds or more again that' be
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
really hard for an officer to time or
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
whatever but just wanted to put that out
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
there for you and I think that might be
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
everything I have to to say off the bat
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
I did actually it's not illegal don't
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
get mad at me you can be mad but don't
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
get mad at me I wrote the bullet points
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
for my introduction while I was driving
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
so any any any questions when the
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee presentent V thank you Mr
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
question do you do you know exactly what
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court decision was and what
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
the behavior was that they were dealing
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
with yes and actually it was a behavior
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
by a former colleague of ours um that uh
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
I've also been pulled over though not
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
ticketed for which is holding a phone
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
that is not you're not actually
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
operating now in the EX in my example I
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
was picked up a phone to it had fallen
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
out of my bag onto the seat and I picked
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
it up to put it back in the seat in the
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the bag um in the example of our
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
former colleague he was on Bluetooth on
 
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
the Bluetooth device so he was not
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
operating the phone but the phone I
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
think had fallen down and he picked it
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
up he it fell down and he picked it up
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
and he was holding a phone but not
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
engaging with the phone and currently
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
officers do pull over and ticket people
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
for holding a phone even if it's powered
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
off it's capable of connecting to the
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
internet capable of sending and
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
receiving messages and therefore just
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
holding the phone even if it's broken
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
just holding the phone is a violation
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
that can put points on your license 150
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
offense but holding this was fine that
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
up so how that would
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
probably fall under the negligent
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
driving law in the state are you
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with that law I don't see how
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's negligent driving it's a
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
violation of the handsfree law but the
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh our former colleague was as far as I
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
know and it's would have been brought up
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
in the the case I think if there had
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
been otherwise was not engaged in any
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
other problematic driving
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
behavior no I just mean
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
that um any behavior that distracts you
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
and causes an accident would fall under
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
the the negligent driving law which
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
would technically be a I don't believe
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
you can be pulled over for negligent
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
driving until we do do something
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
actually negligent that would require
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
you to be you know cited or or something
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
along those lines
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
so where do you have kind of a secondary
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
law well place I for for that kind of
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
for the kind of behavior that would
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
cause problem so he wasn't cited for
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
negligent driving um and if if holding
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
an item was negligent driving then I
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
think all of us that drink our coffee in
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
the morning on the way to work would get
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
cited for negligent driving or put on
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
our makeup or whatever but that's not
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
happening so at some point despite
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
having negligent driving we decided
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
actually some point being 10 years ago
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
we decided that phones in particular
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
were a problem and indeed they are and
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
we wanted to create a special law for
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
that behavior because it was such a
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
problem which indeed it is and what I'm
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
that some of the behaviors with phones
 
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
that we have included in that law
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
because it's too hard for officers to
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
see exactly what you're doing on your
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
phone some of those behaviors are not
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and are not
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
problematic are not negligent and the
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has upheld that so we need
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
to whatever else you think of me in my
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
driving and my professional million
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
miles and whatever else you think of
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
anyone's driving the Supreme Court has
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
said we need to clean up our law so you
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to go with it working as a
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
secondary offense if this committee
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to but you do have a
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle no pun to go ahead and amend the
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
law in a timely way because the Supreme
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
Court just made this
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
decision representative Hill thank you
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question while you asked
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to pick up my phone
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of freaking
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
out do I understand um that if this law
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
if your bill were to pass um and an
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
officer did see you doing what you said
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
is um the the idea that we were supposed
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
to avoid um he would not be able to stop
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
you and ticket you unless you were doing
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
something else like were swerving or
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
driving too close or something like that
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
correct and the committee's welcome to
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
amend that and kind of try to delineate
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
those two behaviors in particular again
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's why the language is how is is
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
because it's very hard for officers to
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
see exactly but I will say that you have
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
many of us well I don't have new car I
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
have very old car with 400,000 miles on
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
it but Toyota but many of us have a
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
large screen that we operate on the
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle right and that touching that is
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
fine and if we put this in a holder
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
being a much smaller and again I have
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
one of the largest ones being a much
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
smaller screen we are now leaning in to
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
try to see what's on our screen rather
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
than holding it here in the field of
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
view of the road in a more convenient
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
and Safe Way um all because it's we're
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to hold it in our hand
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
so this is a problem but
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
this is less of a problem than
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you yep any other
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
Johnson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh the court
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
case that you're referring to what is
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
the name of
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
that well I know that the name I guess
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
it' be State
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
vhole I presume I I I don't have it
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
memorized off the top of my head but
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
certainly holes in the in the name of
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
the case followup followup I believe it
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
was in the union leader article as well
 
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
over the last week or so okay thank you
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
um so if an officer sees you driving
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
down the road doing this and you're not
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the road they still can't
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
pull you over in in this no because what
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing let's say you're doing this
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
but you're doing this for two seconds or
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
less right so by the national traffic
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
and safety administration that's not
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
technically distracted driving so at
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
least in terms of your field of view so
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
um having said that I'm not it's not
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
like I'm sitting here going it has to be
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
this or nothing I'm repeatedly saying
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know you need to change the law this
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
is an elegant way to change the law if
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
you want to further delineate between um
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know pressing buttons on your phone
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to pressing buttons on the
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
car as opposed to like dealing with a
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
radio as opposed to whatever then that's
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
up to the committee but the committee 10
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
years ago tried this and couldn't figure
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
out a good way to give officers an easy
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
thing to enforce what this does is say
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
if you're not doing anything else
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous on the road then maybe it's
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
not distracted driving perhaps this
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee wants to try the two second
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
thing or 3 second or whatever and say
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
that officers should be looking and
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
Counting how many seconds a person is
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
not looking at the road in that case you
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
could wrap in behaviors like writing
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
your speech beforehand or putting on
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
makeup I did not put on makeup in while
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
I was driving by the
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
way any other questions from the
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative H uh thank you
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you representative
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
for being here today um in your
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
testimony you've given a lot of example
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
about levels of distracted drive and
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
using phone and your notebook Etc which
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
so what does your bill actually do other
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
than make this a secondary offense to
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
the correct any behaviors
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
or uh prevent any problems well it
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
brings our law into line with the
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision and I think
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
that's valuable in and of itself um but
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
no it makes it a secondary offense it
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
does not I am not proposing that this is
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
going to get rid of an already existing
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
in our current law the current law
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's overly broad be as Su Supreme
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
Court case the already existing
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
distracted driver problem that is a real
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be dealt with
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
dealt with perhaps via law but also
 
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
education also many different things can
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
be used to deal with that I'm not
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
proposing that I'm dealing with that
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
problem I'm proposing I'm dealing with
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
the problem of people who are not
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
distracted getting tickets because the
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
law is overly Broad and if I had come
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
here before The Supreme Court decision
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
was made I would have it just would have
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
been me with my million miles
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
professional telling you that there are
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
people being ticketed for an overly
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
broad law when they're not being
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
distracted but now I have the Supreme
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
Court backing me up which are words that
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
I rarely get to
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
say thank any other questions not seeing
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
let the committee know we have five
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
other speakers on this particular Talk
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
speech Mr chair do we have anybody from
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%

going to testify that's who's coming up
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
next thank you very much we have that do
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
as well chair like now recognize
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Chris Storm from the New
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police asking for about
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
three to four minutes who has opposed
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
how's that better my name is Lieutenant
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
Chris storm I uh I represent the New
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police in the department
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
of safety uh my current position with
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
the state police is I am charged with
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
special services and also the liais onto
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
the uh office of Highway Safety um the
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police and
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety obviously oppose
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
this law um we are struggling every
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
single day to stop distracted driving
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
which is one of the leading causes of
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
fatal crashes throughout our country um
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
the Nitsa um studies all show that this
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
is a massive problem
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
along our roadways um we feel that that
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
the law is already written uh properly
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
the law is um is very in tune to what's
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
going on out there and this was that
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case was a very narrow um
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
situation um that indeed that uh that
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
gentleman was just simply holding a
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
phone and not actively using it uh we
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
understand that that's why we have
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
discretion that's why we have uh we were
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
able to talk to people once we're up to
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
to their vehicles but overall we need
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
that law to help keep everybody on New
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roadway safe by if they're
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
manipulating that phone if they are
 
01:09:34.349 --> 01:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
distracted to rep uh representative V's
 
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
um Point um absolutely if you are
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
actively doing something that is
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
distracting you um it is absolutely
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
under that negligent driving statute uh
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
26579 B um and that we can actually take
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
action if you are doing something that's
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
distracting that's causing a collision
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
or anything else that's uh um
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
predominantly bad on our roadways and I
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
be more than willing to answer any
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%

head looking
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
down potentially at their lap or
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
something uh would that be potentially
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
probable cause to pull them over not
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily you'd actually have to see
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
that device actually see them actually
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
doing something if you're just simply
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
looking down unfortunately there's no
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
law that says just looking down is a
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
crime thank you any other questions from
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
the committee no representative ve thank
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you taking my
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
question is it obvious when somebody is
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
just holding something versus when
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
they're actively engaging it and
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
manipulating it yes AB absolutely we
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
definitely will see somebody actually
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
manipulating that particular device or
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
something there that would draw our
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
attention to stop that
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle any other questions from the
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%

opportunity to convey our views on HB
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
411 uh my name is Jim Moody I am the
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
incoming vice president of the New

organization commonly referred to as

nimro U and on behalf of nimro I am
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
opposing HB 411 I for a few reasons why
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
nimro believes retaining the use of a
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
mobile electronic device while driving U
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
should be remain as a primary offense uh
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
other testimonies been given about
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
distracted driving uh distracted driving
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
is any activity that um diverts
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
attention from driving including talking
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
or texting eating and drinking talking
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
to people in your vehicle fiddling with
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
your stereo entertainment nav system
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
anything that takes your attention away
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
from the task of safe driving texting
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
obviously um is the most alarming
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
distraction sending a reading a te text
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
takes your eyes off the road for 5
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
seconds on average um at 55 miles an
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
hour uh that's like driving the length
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
of an entire football field with your
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
eyes closed uh using a cell phone while
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
driving creates enormous potential for
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
deaths and injury on on us roads
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
according to Nitsa in 2022 3,38 people
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
were killed in motor vehicle crashes
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
involving distracted drivers this
 
01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
accounts for between 8 and 9% of all
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
fatal motor vehicle collisions on roads
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
across the US to put that in perspective
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
a total of nine people every day in the
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
US are uh killed uh from distracted
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
driving however not all distracted
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
driving crashes are fatal the total of
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
driver distraction is far greater
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
considering crashes that caused injury
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
324,000 Hampshire in
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
2024 while our vehicles have become
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
safer that doesn't mean our roads are
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
safe from distracted drivers distraction
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
affects driver performance by causing
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
reduced Reaction Time impaired
 
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
decision-making decreased situational
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
awareness and compromise vehicle control
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
motorcycles are at particularly high
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
risk for collisions when drivers are
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
cognitively distracted thank you for for
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
your time and I hope that you would
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
consider our statements on this bill and

roadway safety is a a Cornerstone issue
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
for NADA uh on on multiple issues uh
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
over 10 years ago we worked with the
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety um and the other
 
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to help craft this language
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh specifically at the time it was Major
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
Shapiro uh from the office of Highway
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
Safety um and a lot of work went into
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the to the language um there is
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
increased dangerous activity and and
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
accidents on the roads in New Hampshire
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
you know Union Leader uh this weekend
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
individuals stopped going 125 mil hour
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
on 93 uh excessive speeding uh you've
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
heard us talk about for last year was
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
the deadliest year on the roads for
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
youth operators um and so this is no
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
time to weaken uh our our laws that
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
affect roadway safety the three big
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
issues really are distraction um
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
impairment and speed okay so the three
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
legs of that stool uh it's it's no time
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
to to weaken one of those legs um and if
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
the committee did so feel uh necessary
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
to TW tweak the law based on the recent
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision um then we would
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
gladly work as a stakeholder and
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
participate um including that in the the
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
perspective of some of the newer vehicle
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
technology uh that we find in our cars
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
and and trucks so um with that being
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%

because I know we're running late um
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
triaa has a foundation AAA foundation
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
for Traffic Safety that is the has done
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
about a dozen studies on distracted
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
driving and I'm just going to lay out a
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
couple key points about the dangers of
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
distracted driving that we have studied
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the University of
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
Utah over the years any cell phone use
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
quadruples your crash risk cognitive
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
distraction which means you're not
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the phone but anytime you use
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
your phone you have a mental distraction
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
in other words cognitive distraction is
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
real and even with your hands on the
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
wheel and your eyes on the road these
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
distractions dangerously affect your
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
driving performance texting creates a
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%

01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
driving while not distracted with one
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
out of every 20 drivers using a cell
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
phone at any given time on the roads um
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
it's extremely dangerous drivers also in
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
our latest study drivers experience
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
what's known as a hangover effect a
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
lasting distraction that lasts up to 27
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
seconds after you hang up your cell
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
phone even so when you're at and this is
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
they test that when people are at stop
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
signs or at red lights when they're
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
texting or using their
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
phone they they hang up and they have a
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
hangover effect it's still a mental
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
distraction that in some instances led
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
to 27 seconds of continued
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
distraction we do an annual survey
 
01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
across the country it's called the triaa
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
foundation Traffic Safety culture index
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
last year 93% of respondents cited
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
distraction as a serious problem and a
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
behavior that makes them feel less safe
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the road a year ago or two years ago
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
the year before it was
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
83% and that's people are just feeling
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
less safe on the roads and distraction
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the largest issues and I also
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow Dan Bennett I also
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
have a stool analogy improving it's it
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
traffic safety is founded on three e you
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
need strong enforcement you need an
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
effective law and you also have to have
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
an education
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
campaign think of this concept as a
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool if one leg is missing
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
or damaged that schol is weakened and
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
unsafe passing this law weakens that
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
that one leg thus making our roads in
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire less safe um I I urg you
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
to in to vote in opposition to this and
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%

okay yeah that was a mischaracterization
sorry

sorry
 
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
chair now like to recognize Bill Bennett

from the Hampshire do asking one to two
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
minutes who doesn't take any position on
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman that's Bill
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
Lambert um not
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
Bennett um so for the record Bill
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
Lambert New Hampshire do Highway um
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
safety act of Transportation
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
administrator and do does not have a
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
position on this bill a couple quick
 
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
antidotes uh long before Lieutenant
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
storm was in State Police I remember
 
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Susan fory telling an
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
anecdote 2004 when the Red Sox Run the
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
World Series of pulling somebody over on
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
i93 that was watching the Red Sox on the
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
laptop that their passenger was um was
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
um open and holding and that person was
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
very disappointed that they got a ticket
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
for distracted driving because it was
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
the Red Sox and they were in the World
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
Series um so distracted driving has been
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
a serious issue for a while uh I know
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation adopted
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
our our internal um self phone use
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
policy and we recognize that it's not I
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
think it's the cognitive uh distraction
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
that Dan Goodman recently talked about
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
um it's not just the the use of the
 
01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
phone and the physical use of the phone
 
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's a cognitive distraction in our
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
policy before there was a handsfree law
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the state was that any cell phone use
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh during a vehicle whether you're
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
handsfree or not was going to be um was
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
going to be prohibited ironically the
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
first person to get um discipline for
 
01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
for violating that policy was out then
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner that signed it uh when he
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
was spotted by employees for U having a
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
cell phone in his hand and he wrote
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
himself a letter of warning so again we
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a position on this but we
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
recognize and we support our enforcement
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
um um Partners in highway safety because
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
distraction is a very serious problem on
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
our highways our folks that are working
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
on the road that that's their office
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
space see it every day uh the people
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
that are going by of them are not paying
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
attention to what they're doing and it's
 
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
it's not just for the General Highway
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
Safety we um we're concerned about our
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
own employees safety and with that I'd
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir any questions
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative St
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
um I should have asked the the last
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
speaker about this but I'm curious in
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
your field have you ever heard about
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
this hangover effect of using a cell
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
phone or for that matter listening to
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
the news on the radio or anything when
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
you're driving um the cognitive
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
distraction on very well aware of but I
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
can be distracted when I'm driving with
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
talking to my wife in the passenger seat
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
fortunately in that case my wife will
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
remind me to pay attention to the road
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
um but I I have heard of The Hangover
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
effect I've probably heard it from from
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Goodman and in other conversations
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
but it's it seems intuitive to me that
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
when you're having a conversation and
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
you hang up you still thinking about
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
that conversation um so and I don't have
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
any data I'm sure U Mr Goodman has more
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
data than I um but I have her of
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
B followup followup thank you um but do
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
you not agree that that hangover effect
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
could be listening to a news report that
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
upsets you on the
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
radio certainly uh for the last 10 years
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
I if not listen to any kind of voice
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
radio I have 10,000 songs from my
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
library on my phone and that's all I
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
listen to on the vehicle U and and
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why I mean it
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
was a while when I was listening to talk
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
radio where I could feel myself being
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
engaged and agitated so I certainly
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
understand that thank you any other
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
any thank
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any other uh pin cards
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
for anybody else to testify and just to
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
kind of wrap up in terms of online
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
constituents supported this bill nine
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
and six opposed so with that I'm going
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on HB 411
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
next bill is HB 441 we'll stop that in
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
about two
 
01:22:53.440 --> 01:23:23.430 align:start position:0%
about two
minutes

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
all right being about 11:22 like to open
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
up the public hearing on HB
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
441 relative to visible motor vehicle
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
diesel emissions and rolling coal chair
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
like to recognize representative heat
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
Howard uh who's the Prime sponsor of the
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
bill who supports the bill sir welcome
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
to Transportation thank you honorable Mr
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
chair and committee members uh I
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
apologize that I was a few minutes late
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh I have committee going on right now
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh upstairs uh but HB 441 prohibits the
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
operation of diesel vehicles under1
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
18,000 with altered exhaust systems that
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
emit excessive smoke uh commonly known
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
as rolling coal it is a step towards
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
safeguarding Public Health reducing
 
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
environmental harm and promoting
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
responsible vehicle use this ban uh this
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
would ban the intentional modification
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
of vehicles to emit thick plumes of
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
smoke and by Banning this practice this
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
the bill directly mitigates localized
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
air pollution protecting vulnerable
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
populations like children the elderly
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
and those with pre-existing health
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
conditions uh black carbon the major
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
component of De uh diesel smoke has a
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
global warming potential of up to uh
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
3,300 times greater than carbon dioxide
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
over 20 year period reducing black
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions is a cost-effective
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
strategy to slow near-term climate
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
warming this bill aligns with broader
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
efforts such as the diesel emissions
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
reduction Act passed uh federally back
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
in 2010 uh which prioritized
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
retrofitting diesel engines uh to curve
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
emissions uh prohibiting rolling coal
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
ensures that individual actions do not
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
undermine Collective climate goals
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
excessive smoke from rolling coal
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
impairs visibility for drivers cyclists
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
and pedestrians increasing accident
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
risks the bill reinforces civic
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility by penalizing deliberate
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
actions that endangers others uh and
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
reinforces civic responsibility by
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
penalizing deliberate actions that
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
endanger others Modern Diesel engines
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
are equipped with uh emission controls
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
such as uh particulate filters uh which
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
already achieve near zero plent
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
levels this law ensures that vehicle
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
modifications do not revert to outdated
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
harmful practices by preventing the
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
intentional use of smoke in a harmful
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
manner this bill is also less extreme
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
than some of the other laws passed
 
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the United States by uh
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
creating this as a violation and not a
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
felony uh with that I'm open to any
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you sir any
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative St Clair thank
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh um and thank
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
you when that smoke comes
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
out and it's in the air how long does it
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
take if you know the answer
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
to dissipate in other words you don't
 
01:27:08.669 --> 01:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
see it anymore that's a good question
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not fully certain I mean it depends
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
on how long somebody is uh uh trying to
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
push that smoke out and obviously uh it
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
can take quite a while to dissipate
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have someone from the
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dees up to speak so they
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer that
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
question any other questions from the
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative hble thank you
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you representative for
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
being here taking that questions um so
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
just to be clear in order to be able to
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
produce this black smoke is the only way
 
01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
to do that through an a modification of
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
the exhaust system uh I believe so it
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be it's either going to be an
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
older diesel motor or it's going to be
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
one that has been uh Modified by the
 
01:27:53.639 --> 01:27:54.629 align:start position:0%
one that has been uh Modified by the
owner

01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh meaning that they would have
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally violated this uh statute
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you thank
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
you chair now i' like to recognize
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
Michael Fitzgerald from the New
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees who's not taking any
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
position on the bill who's asking for
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
two minutes welcome S
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you very much Mr
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
chairman uh stated Michael fitzgeral
 
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:22.040 align:start position:0%

Resources Division of the Department of
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental Service Services uh as
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned previously we work with
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety to implement
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
the vehicle emissions uh control program
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
here in the state and uh I we do not
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
take a position on this bill I do not
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
disagree with anything that the sponsor
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
said uh previously uh relative to
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
emissions uh I just wanted to point out
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
that there already are statutes that
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
address this issue um there are anti
 
01:28:53.109 --> 01:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
there are both federal and state
 
01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.189 align:start position:0%
there are both federal and state
anti-tampering

01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
anti-tampering
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
um uh statutes uh and and uh rules uh
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
currently uh rule uh safety rule uh
 
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.390 align:start position:0%
currently uh rule uh safety rule uh
322

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
322
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
32220 4 uh prohibits tampering uh of a
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
missions equipment on a vehicle it's
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
also prohibited under the missions
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
control program under RSA
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
26659 which also authorizes the
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety to conduct capacity
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
testing uh on uh on trucks and vehicles
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh I believe this bill is intended to
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
address smaller vehicles um but um uh we
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
do have that program and people can
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
complain to the state police um file
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
complaints and um have those have those
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
followed up um that no way I I don't
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
intend to say this bill isn't necessary
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
again we're not taking a position I just
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to be aware that uh
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
those uh statutes and and those programs
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
um that that do exist already and I'd be
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
happy to address any questions thank you
 
01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
sir any questions from the committee
 
01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.870 align:start position:0%
sir any questions from the committee
representative

01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
patero thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
question um I want to make sure that
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
what this bill is talking about is what
 
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm imagining it is okay
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we're it it's
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
addressing a specific situation where
 
01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.270 align:start position:0%
addressing a specific situation where
where

01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
people have a diesel vehicle and they
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
modify the exhaust system on the diesel
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle to have black
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
smoke simply for a visual effect is that
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
what this bill is talking about uh to
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge yes I'm I'm not
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh an expert on rolling coal but the
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
term as I understand it is uh where
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
people alter the emissions system so
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
that they can at certain times um uh
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
emit large amounts of dark black smoke
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh have it impact Vehicles
 
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh have it impact Vehicles
behind

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
them thank you uh quick followup Mr
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
chair follow up thank you
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
um when I when I was younger and riding
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the back seat with my parents all
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
over everywhere you know you had logging
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
trucks and Mac trucks and bigger trucks
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
I realized they're probably over 18,000
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
Pounds right yeah
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
um but but those trucks exhausts back in
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
those days would be shooting black AB
 
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know um you you said that this was
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
um below a certain weight capacity
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony am I on the
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
right train of thought here with
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
imagining this whole bill uh yes I
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
believe the the bill refers to vehicles
 
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:54.750 align:start position:0%
believe the the bill refers to vehicles
under

01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
18,000 um and uh uh I I certainly
 
01:32:01.709 --> 01:32:01.719 align:start position:0%
understand what you're talking about um
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know older diesel vehicles certainly
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
do emit can can emit uh significant
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
amounts of black smoke that's the intent
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the opacity uh regulation that we
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
have on the books now and the opacity
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
testing that that can be conducted by
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and uh um also
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
I would just point out that diesel
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles over the last 20 years have uh
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
you know cleaned up tremendously um
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's a the sponsor of the
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill mentioned there was a uh uh there's
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
been significant Improvement in the
 
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
emissions controls and so on however
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
there are still a lot of those Vehicles
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
diesel vehicles can last 20 30 40 years
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
depending on the mileage they can be
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
rebuilt Etc so um there's still a large
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
number of those Vehicles out there um
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
but I think this is intended to address
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
that specific intentional Act of rolling
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
Co thank you so much any other questions
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%

immigrant rights Network detailing legal

legislation I'm a co-signer on that and
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
fully agree with the points set out in

the letter my remarks today will address
 
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
a very practical concern with this bill
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
that our clients have
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
experienced uh driver's license in New
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not a privilege it's a
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
necessity we do not have the population
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
to support extens of bus or rail service
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
to live in New Hampshire to thrive in
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to work in New Hampshire
 
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
requires you to drive in New Hampshire
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
specifically according to the Census
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
Bureau only 0.3% of New Hampshire
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
residents use public transportation to
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
get to work we all want safe roads
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
traveled by only licensed drivers who
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
have demonstrated their ability to
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
operate their vehicle in accordance with
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
the laws of our state we also want New
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents to be able to fully
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
participate in our economy and our
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce to contribute to the public
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
good and to be able to provide for
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families without
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
relying on the state for support this
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill would prevent many New Hampshire
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
residents from being able to do exactly
 
01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.030 align:start position:0%
residents from being able to do exactly
that

01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
I don't pretend to understand the
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
motives behind this bill if it is to
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
encourage new arrivals in our state to
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
learn English I can assure you that no
 
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
punitive encouragement is needed at The
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
International Institute in Manchester we
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
offer at any given time 10 esol courses
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh to beginners intermediate and
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
advanced Learners with up to 25 students
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
in each and we currently have over 200
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
students on the wait list if the goal is
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
to encourage immigrants to in the state
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
to learn English fund more esol training
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
the carrot will work better than the
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
stick in this endeavor every immigrant
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
who comes to New Hampshire no matter
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
where they are coming from is here for
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for a better life than
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
where they're from despite the
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
attractiveness at life here for a recent
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
study by New Hampshire employment
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
security office the state has fewer
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
immigrants per capita than much of the
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the country specifically foreign
 
01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:15.159 align:start position:0%
born residents accounted for a smaller
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
share of New Hampshire's population
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
6.8% approximately half the share of the
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
overall US population among foreign born
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
61% were naturalized citizens compared
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
to 52% of foreign born us residents to
 
01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
continue to and Thrive and grow New
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs immigrants who are more
 
01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
likely to be in their Prime working
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
years than other M migrants from the
 
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
report 65% of residents who had moved
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
from abroad between 2017 and 2022 were
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 18 and 44 compared
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
to 34% of the total State uh
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
population the report States immigrants
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
are a productive and crucial part of the
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy this bill by
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
restricting some immigrants ability to
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
obtain a driver's license delays entry
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
to needed employes into the workforce
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
and means others will be underemployed
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
being restricted to those jobs that
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
require them to rely on limited public
 
01:39:10.589 --> 01:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
transport or other less reliable options
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
to get to work we need to encourage and
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
support all New Hampshire residents to
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
be productive and to thrive in our
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
economy and there is no reason to impede
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
their progress by requiring them to be
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
proficient enough in English to pass a
 
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license test most are striving
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
to learn English to find and hold better
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
paying careers economic and social
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities are more than sufficient
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
incentive for immigrants to learn
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
English we need to support them not
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
hinder them thank you for consideration

01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
at the federal level I'm I'm aware of uh
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
stuff like this
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
and um there was also talk of like there
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's already federal regulations in
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
regards to this um the the area of
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
though of law that I'm familiar with it
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
is has to do with um uh voting actually
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
so to my
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge the the United States of
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
America does not have an official
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
language is there a question here
 
01:41:56.490 --> 01:41:56.500 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.910 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
[Music]

01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
um the United States of America does not
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
have an official language and the reason
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have an official language is so
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
that voting
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
ballots can't be printed in English only
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of my knowledge and
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
and for my question for for for you is
 
01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:23.950 align:start position:0%
and for my question for for for you is
is

01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
printing the tests in different
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
languages and we're allowed the leeway
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
to do that because the federal
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
government does not have an official
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
language fair question thank you sir um
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
so at the DMV um and contracts were
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
pulled yesterday in anticipation of of
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
being um asked to testify here today of
 
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
what we currently offer so uh over 10
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
years ago the DMV um made a decision to
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
pay for and to offer uh Knowledge Test
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
the computer-based test in different
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
languages um those languages are Spanish
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
French American Sign Language Portuguese
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
Mandarin English Farsi and Arabic um so
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
we have customers who come in um that
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
utilize those services to take their
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
Knowledge Test over the computer and um
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
either pass or fail based on their
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the um driving laws that
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
you need to get the 80% to pass the test
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that we've done uh
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
more recently to try to complement that
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
is we worked with the New Hampshire
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
office of Highway Safety and Dan Goodman
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
at Triple A um to provide for manuals
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
the driver manual which the New
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's manual is where the
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
questions come from so if you've studied
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
the driver's manual you're going to do
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
very well on the on the Knowledge Test
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
when you come in um so in order to uh
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
serve the community and we have monthly
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
community outreach meetings at the DMV
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
where we hear from community members and
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
concerns um challenges that that uh
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
community members face um so we took a
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
look at those seven knowledge
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
tests and thanks to the office of
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety in trip triaa we were
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
able to secure funding to print the
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
driver's manual uh in five different
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
languages that would help align with
 
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
those knowledge tests uh and that would
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
be sili span Portuguese Mandarin and
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
Arabic um the proactive rationale for
 
01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
doing that was that we see what's
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
happening on the roadways today and the
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
number of crashes the deaths um and
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
giving individuals that are going to
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
come in and take the knowledge test that
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
information and being better prepared
 
01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
being able to digest the information to
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
make them presumably a better driver on
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
the roadway um was something that we um
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
we looked at to uh to try to serve the
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
community and if I could just go back to
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair's question I
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
have spoken with the MV directors
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
throughout North America uh with regards
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
to either not so much bills that would
 
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
do what this bill intends to do but
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
other DMVs and I've testified to this
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
before other DMVs around the country do
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
have uh tests that are offered in a
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
multitude of different languages uh some
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
provide for the driver's manual in
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
different languages some do it in
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
different ways some do it the way that
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
we did it through a contract so that you
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
have an accurate uh translation so word
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
for word that is um signed off on and
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
certified so that that way there nobody
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
reads something the wrong way or takes
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
the test and gets something wrong
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't translated properly in
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
the manual uh other states um simply use
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
Google Translate on their website to
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
translate their manual but the problem
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
with that is it's not always accurate um
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
so other states around the country the
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
vast majority um do provide for these
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
Services um and one other thing
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
represented you mentioned I the the
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
federal piece I know that there's
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony here today um but uh
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
one thing that did catch my attention
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
was I received a PowerPoint presentation
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
from John CLE uh the program manager in
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety and um in
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
that PowerPoint apparently was put it
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
was put out by Nitsa in
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
2025 um and IT addresses the Civil
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
Rights Act of
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
1964 in that PowerPoint it talks about
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh nit of grants that are extended to uh
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
and it actually uses DMV uh as an
 
01:46:28.109 --> 01:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
example in the PowerPoint um grants that
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
are issued to the agency even if it's
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
just for one person um you're subject to
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
the parameters of the Grant and per um
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 if you've
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
got a population of customer within your
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
state substantial customer population
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
that would require language
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
accessibility um because there's limited
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
uh English proficiency in order to stay
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the grant um you
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
would need to provide that um so the DMV
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
actually is in compliance with that we
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
do have one Grant funded position within
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
the organization from Nitsa um and that
 
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
person is Ian Marsh who oversees um all
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
the fatal crashes that come in
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and captures that
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
information and presents it um on a a
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
weekly basis as to where we are going
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
with crashes so um those are just some
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
highlights to offer but um again happy
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
to take any questions if there are I
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually have a question you mentioned
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
these these languages you said Spanish
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
French Bary Mandarin AR
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
Arabic how many how many I guess how
 
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
many tests have been provided in these
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
languages do you have like numbers you
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
can share do I do Mr chair I don't have
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
them with me uh this this morning I do
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
have those numbers they were recently
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
run um they were run in order to
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
determine if if we were going to
 
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
translate these manuals Which languages
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
would be the manuals um we would want
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
the manuals translated uh into because
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
we went with the highest volume so I do
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
have those numbers for you I can provide
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
those to you um through an email and for
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative Fox
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you director
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
morasco so in addition if this bill is
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
passed in addition to Spanish French
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
Portuguese Mandarin and
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
Arabic it would also
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh testing materials in sign
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
language that's is that correct uh
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
actually I think the bill makes a
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.109 --> 01:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
mistaken thank you I'll look for
 
01:48:40.119 --> 01:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
mistaken thank you I'll look for
that

01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
hypothetical Bae hires a scientist that
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
speaks primarily French and they want
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
them to relocate to
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
NASA and they have 60 days do they have
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
60 days to tr get their license yes
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
converted so if they don't speak good
 
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
English and they're coming
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
here and they don't have an option to
 
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
take it in French how does BAE ensure
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
this person can travel and get to
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
work um thank you representative for the
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
question it it's I don't know how they
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
would ensure that um you know we we do
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
have and I'm going to get for the chair
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the actual numbers for um the
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
different languages and who takes the
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
test in those languages um but there are
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
a fair number of people that utilize
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
that opportunity the other thing that
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
that should be highlighted um should
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
this bill pass is there is a um a
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
section within the DMV rule set that
 
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
does provide for the opportunity for a
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
thirdparty translator uh to be present
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the test taker uh during the
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge exam so although these
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
languages the seven that we offer uh
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
if you are able to speak one of those
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
languages and the Knowledge Test is
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
beneficial to you to take um but what if
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're language number eight 10 11 um so
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
the rule set does allow for a thirdparty
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
translator for languages that we don't
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
offer to come in and assist with the
 
01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:11.719 align:start position:0%
reading of the uh the exam um to help on
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
that front so uh I hope that answers
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
your question thank
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
you representative foot thank you Mr
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you director for taking my
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
question Mr um so in today's world
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of signage roadways
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
highways things like that so and I know
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
signs are associated with like color
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
shapes sizes things like that is there
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
any data relative to any kind of issues
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
with interpretation whether it be
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
accidents or violations that somebody
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
who's non English speaking
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting a sign or not
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
understanding a sign do we have that
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's a good question sir I don't I don't
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
have that information off hand I don't
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
know I can tell you that when we went
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
through the process of securing the
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
contract and providing for the
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
translated manuals uh one of the things
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we had to make sure that we ensured
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
was uh that the signs just like when the
 
01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
test is taken the signs are the signs
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we see out out here so the sign is
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
an octagon that says stop on it um it's
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
stop and even if your native language is
 
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
s you still have to recognize that that
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
means stop and that says stop in English
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
so the signs both in the manual for the
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
testing uh are going to be in the uh in
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
English so signs will have to be
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
recognized in English
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the uh
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
third party
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
translators um does the state pay for
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
those when they are needed and if so
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
would this create an additional
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
financial burden for the people who
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to take the tests using the
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
languages that we would be
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating it's an excellent question
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh my understanding is
 
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
that at this
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
time translators are brought in by the
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
the candidate um so they they bring in a
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
um a third party translator of their
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
choosing um but you raised an
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
interesting point with regards to um
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
certainly de and heart of hearing um
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
that require assistance for that would
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
be uh incumbent upon the state to
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
provide that so this is an area that we
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
would we would have to look into
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
although I haven't been faced with
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
anything where we've been asked to
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
provide for it um and pay for it yet I'm
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
not aware of that thank you
 
01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:19.950 align:start position:0%
not aware of that thank you
representative

01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you Mr chairman uh good
 
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.430 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you Mr chairman uh good
morning

01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
morning if a person um I'm following up
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
on uh representative REO if a person
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
comes from a foreign country and has a
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
license in that country do we have any
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
type of reciprocity or do they all have
 
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
to take an
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
exam well we have um although I haven't
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
seen the agreements uh I've asked for
 
01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
them but I haven't been presented with
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
the actual agreements we have uh on the
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
books I'm told reciprocity with Canada
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
and France uh we are still working
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
through a reciprocity agreement with
 
01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.189 align:start position:0%
through a reciprocity agreement with
Taiwan

01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
Taiwan
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
um so those countries we have
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with um in in other
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
instances to representative Bay's point
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
it would be the if you establish the
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
residency within 60 days you'd have to
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
apply for the New Hampshire driver's
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
license follow followup if you have a to
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on that if you have a license
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
in France or or a country that we don't
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity with and you are going
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
to excuse me become a citizen within 60
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
days is it are you going to make make
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%

01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
Sir uh Mr chairman members of the
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
to testify uh today in support of hb212
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
um as you know nhada is a trade
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
Association for the motor vehicle
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
industry uh here in New Hampshire um
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
we've always mentioned to this committee
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh that we support common sense if there
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
if there are changes to the inspection
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
emissions program uh we would support
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
Common Sense changes to the program uh
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
we always ask that you uh look at the
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
program with a scalpel not a hatchet uh
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
and this bill does exactly that it
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
provides consumer benefit giving a
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
little more time to save Monies to get
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh needed repairs um while it doesn't
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
weaken uh safety of the vehicles on the
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
roadways um you know we do acknowledge
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
that uh there may be some changes that
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
are needed to our state implementation
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
plan under the Clean Air Act uh so we
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
hope that you take care and caution with
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that as there is Federal Highway funding
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
tied to uh Clean Air Act compliance uh
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
but the department of environment
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
services are the true experts on that um
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
so uh the only other thing that I that I
 
01:57:29.069 --> 01:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
want to mention um that we do have a
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
little bit of concern and we hope that
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
you consider in giving this longer time
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
frame for emissions inspection repair
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
what you may find is uh games being
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
played in the private marketplace where
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
possibly battery cables are pulled the
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
check engine light goes on the vehicle
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
is then sold and transferred it's less
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
likely to happen in the um in the dealer
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
world uh because of our testing
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
equipment that we have uh to actually
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
monitor readiness ob2 check engine
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
lights um but we just kind of caution
 
01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
that that there may be a negative impact
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the uh consumer Marketplace the front
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
yard sales um to unload a vehicle that
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
um was not uh properly repaired so other
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
than that um that's our testimony on
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
hb212 thank you sir any questions from
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
Johnson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um can you
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
please explain why 60 days is
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
insufficient and you need more
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
days thanks for the question question R
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
Johnson um you know some of the repairs
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
that are needed for uh OBD2 uh emissions
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
are a little more costly uh we're not
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're not always talking about an O2
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
fuel sensor or a misfitting gas cap at
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
times it could be catalytic converters
 
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh 122 $1,00 so more costly
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
repairs so this bill um it doesn't give
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
a complete waiver from from getting the
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
repair it just gives the citizen the
 
01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
customer a little more time to bank some
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:54.510 --> 01:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you sir thank you
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
sir chair now like to recognize Jeremy
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
Olen who's supporting himself asking for
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
two minutes who supports the bill
 
01:59:07.709 --> 01:59:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation good morning members of
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee and thank
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to testify on this
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
bill I actually here later to testify in
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
favor of HB 649 which is a much wider oh
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
can you introduce yourself please oh yes
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
um my name is my name is Jeremy Olson
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
and I live in Manchester w 11 so I'll be
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
here testifying later on HP 649 which is
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
a much wider scope on the inspection
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
stuff I just wanted to reiterate I would
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
support this bill also um I'll be
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
talking about this later in HP 649 but
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
there are tons of stories of people out
 
01:59:39.629 --> 01:59:39.639 align:start position:0%
there where they have the check engine
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
light come on in their car and then it
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass inspection and these
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
repairs as the um the dealership guy
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
said these repairs can cost thousands of
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
dollars sometimes nowadays like with
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues sometimes it takes
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
the parts weeks or months to get here if
 
01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
it's a foreign car things like that I've
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
had that proba happen myself with tires
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
even it took them two months to send
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
tires for my car at one point so when
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with complicated
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
Electronics it can be very expensive and
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
it can be very tedious to get it
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
repaired the 60 days is quite frankly
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
not enough for a lot of people nowadays
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
again to read Get Right like you said it
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
it costs a lot of money so expanding it
 
02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
to six months would be very reasonable
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
for people to be able to deal with so
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
again I support this bill and um I'd be
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
you chair now i' like to recognize Steve
 
02:00:36.069 --> 02:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
zamek who's representing
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
himself who is uh supporting the bill
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
welcome uh sir the
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
transportation hi thanks for having me
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Steve zanic I live in West
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester and W 11 um and I support
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh one of the main reasons
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
I I support this bill is I mean very
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
very frequently the problem's obvious
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
put the part in you're good to go uh but
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes the problem can be not so
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
clear-cut the uh the newer cars are
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
getting more and more sensitive to
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
different emissions things um and it
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
could be something as simple as a wire
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
that is sometimes broken and sometimes
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
connected and you're driving along and
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
you hit a bump and it disconnects for a
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
second and then reconnects next and then
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
when your mechanic is trying to go and
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going on everything
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
looks fine so so some people end up
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
throwing you know thousands of dollars
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
in Parts at the car just to get the
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
check engine light off um and also uh
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a California
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
emissions equipped car uh it's even more
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive than maybe the same exact
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
making model um that is from a you know
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
that does not have the California
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
missions package
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is um if uh if you
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
make a repair sometimes you have to go
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
through a certain number of drive cycles
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh before it will actually pass
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
emissions um so for example I I had a
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
friend who had a um EVAP code which is
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
often just like a loose gas cap and it
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
was intermittent came on came went away
 
02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:18.679 align:start position:0%
came on and then she had to go get her
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker um so I hunted down
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
the actual problem uh ordered the
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
parts uh took a while to get the
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
parts um replaced them and uh you know
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
everything seemed fine except it still
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't going into the What's called the
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
OBD ready um mode and I drove it around
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
like all day and it still wouldn't go
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
into OBD uh ready mode uh I went I went
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
through the uh I went I went to the
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
service manual and I discover discovered
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
that um for the EVAP code to go into OBD
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
ready you it would only do it if you
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
drove a certain distance with the
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
temperature was over 40 uh with the
 
02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
temperature was over 40° so in the
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
middle of winter you're not going to get
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
it to go into OBD ready mode um uh
 
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
unless you find a extra warm day to
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
drive around on um so sometimes you know
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
it takes time just to hunt down a
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
problem or to get it ready for uh
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
emissions testing the other problem is
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
there have been people that they just
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
they tried everything to get the check
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
engine light off or for whatever reason
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
their car is not going to OBD ready mode
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean their car
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
is um polluting so I do think one thing
 
02:03:44.589 --> 02:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
that could improve the the program is if
 
02:03:46.069 --> 02:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of appeal process
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
where we can say hey I don't think my
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
car is polluting can you actually test
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
it like the old school put
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
a sniffer in the tailpipe and see if
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually polluting or not um and
 
02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
actually like scientifically measure
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
things because it might just be fine uh
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and people are throwing thousands of
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
dollars at parts and their car is not
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
even polluting so uh oh and the other
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
thing is um and as cars are getting more
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
advanced with the emissions uh controls
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
on some new cars even the air
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
conditioner uh system is tied into OBD
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
so if you have a uh um if you have a
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
problem with your air conditioning
 
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
system and all the refrigerant uh leaks
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
out and you're like well I don't need uh
 
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
air conditioning it's cold here most of
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
the time anyway um you might need to go
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
and replace that air conditioning system
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh just because of that check engine
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
light or or the uh OBD Readiness uh
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
situation so um and the other thing is
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
um there have been cases for example
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
there was an article in the Boston Globe
 
02:04:52.589 --> 02:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
uh where a guy bought a car in ASA brand
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
new car and uh a check engine light came
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
on and uh it took GM months to figure
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
out what was wrong on a brand new model
 
02:05:05.470 --> 02:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of different situations
 
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
that can put people into a situation so
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
giving them more time would uh be very
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you any questions from the
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
sir okay i' like to recognize Michael
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald from the New Hampshire de
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
s who has written testimony and looking
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
for about two to three minutes welcome
 
02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
back sir thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
Michael Fitzgerald assistant
 
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
director uh air Resources Division
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I'm
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
also accompanied today by Jessica Wilcox
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
who uh manages our uh transportation and
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
energy related programs of which the
 
02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:50.679 align:start position:0%
emissions program is one also um if
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
you're a fan of The Simpsons
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh as you've heard uh Professor Frank
 
02:05:57.069 --> 02:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
say I'm here to restate my nerdy plight
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
once again um I uh uh the department uh
 
02:06:04.589 --> 02:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
implements the motor vehicle inspection
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
program pursuant to the Clean Air Act we
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
did provide you with a letter of
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
testimony again very similar to what you
 
02:06:12.910 --> 02:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
heard me say on HB
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
209 uh in order to revise the program
 
02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
that is currently ins sconed in uh New
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute and
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh also in our federally approved uh
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
State implementation plan with EPA
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the Clean Air Act um we
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
would need to apply to the EPA we would
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
need to to uh evaluate the emissions
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
reductions uh that would occur as a
 
02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
result of this change um I also want to
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
point out that uh there is currently uh
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
we we implement this program as I've
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned before in conjunction with the
 
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety uh the Department
 
02:06:55.069 --> 02:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
of Safety does uh allow under their
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
rules for an economic hardship waiver
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
already and uh last uh last full year
 
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
that we have data
 
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
2023 uh there were 62 economic hardship
 
02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
time extensions uh that were provided
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
and 47 of these were actually used so um
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
we're not aware that this is a uh a huge
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
problem the current uh um program does
 
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
AOW 60 days um but uh uh again we're not
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
taking a position but if we did have to
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
do this we would need to revise the Sip
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and that would take us probably 18
 
02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
months or so with EPA um and again my
 
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
letter references language that's in uh
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
the current s spb
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
157 uh that uh I also referenced in HB
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
209 so I'd be happy to uh take any
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:07:54.270 --> 02:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
question

02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
sure been doing some reading um and I'm
 
02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can tell me when what
 
02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
year we did the uh the national ambient
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
air quality standards for ozone when
 
02:08:14.589 --> 02:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
when did that test take place in order
 
02:08:19.229 --> 02:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
to um list New Hampshire and other
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
northeast states as uh as in the
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
excessive range yeah I'm not I don't
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
have the exact date um there's been
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
there the ozone standard is revised by
 
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
EPA um every five years they don't
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
always get to it so it generally is
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
between five and 10 years uh I believe
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
the last revision might might have been
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
2008 that we were in violation of but I
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
also also point out that um just by
 
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
virtue of the fact that we are in what's
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
known as the ozone transport region the
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
which are the states from basically the
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
States from U Virginia to Maine um that
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
designation that of being in the ozone
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
transport region subjects us to the
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for this test whether we're
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
in attainment or not so follow up follow
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
up as I read the EPA website though it
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
says that some areas that were once in
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
violation of the ozone na a Qs yes have
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
chosen to retain their IM programs as a
 
02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:27.559 align:start position:0%
result of a maintenance plan and an
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
effort to continue to meet the
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
naqs so it sounds like it's something
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that New
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um could well have
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
already exceeded or dropped below the
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
that excessive level but we're still
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
continuing it is that is am I reading
 
02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:49.639 align:start position:0%
that correctly uh somewhat and let me
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
just clarify um
 
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
the uh and this is in my testimony
 
02:09:57.069 --> 02:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
letter also the antib backsliding
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
provision of the Clean Air Act and I
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard this from me
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
before my analogy is uh a diet you weigh
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
250 you go on a diet you lose 50 pounds
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
you get 200 and that doesn't mean that
 
02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
you can just automatically go back to uh
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
eating cheeseburgers again you want to
 
02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
maintain your you want to maintain your
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
diet um and the Clean Air Act is the
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
same the anti-b backsliding provision of
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act
 
02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:22.830 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act
section

02:10:22.830 --> 02:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
110 um requires that once you reach
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
attainment that you maintain those
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
programs under a maintenance provision
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
with EPA um and that uh that goes for 20
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
years what follow up thank you this this
 
02:10:42.189 --> 02:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
makes it sound like it is the choice of
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
the of the state um or the choice of the
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
state to pick Which counties that that
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
have that um anti-back liting or or that
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
concern is is that something that the
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
state decides and who in the state would
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
decide that if so we work uh the first
 
02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
of all the designation as to whether
 
02:11:05.310 --> 02:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
we're in attainment or non-attainment
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
with the standard when EPA promulgates
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the standard we evaluate it we look at
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
our monitoring data and we determine we
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
determine whether we're in or out then
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
we make a recommendation the governor
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
actually makes that uh declaration to
 
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
EPA we we provide the governor with the
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
information and they they send a letter
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
to EPA saying that we designate as
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
whether an attainment or non-attainment
 
02:11:32.589 --> 02:11:32.599 align:start position:0%
um but then the uh the antib backsliding
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
provision is not optional um uh I'm not
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
familiar with the page that you're
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
looking at but um uh the but what again
 
02:11:45.149 --> 02:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
as I've mentioned we would negotiate
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
with EPA we would look at if we were
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to change the program we would
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
look at the changes
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
um and the impact those changes would
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
make on the emissions reduction that the
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
program gets now and we would have to
 
02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
achieve those emissions reductions
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere else um in this case I don't
 
02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
know we haven't done the evaluation of
 
02:12:07.229 --> 02:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
what a change from two months to six
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
months would would make in terms of
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
excess emissions and so on but um uh we
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do that we' so the optional
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
part of it I guess if you want to refer
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
to it that way is is the work that we
 
02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
would do with EPA to revise the the uh
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
standard and we would need between 12
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
and 18 months to do that evaluation get
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
it to EPA get it approved um and also
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
the department of safety would have to
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
change their rules at the same uh uh
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
that implement the program um I'm not
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the department um
 
02:12:46.549 --> 02:12:46.559 align:start position:0%
they're they're here so but uh that that
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to last quick quick
 
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
question could you provide um the
 
02:12:56.350 --> 02:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
committee the the last time that the
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
evaluation was made and the information
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
provided to the governor to to make that
 
02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:04.599 align:start position:0%
for designation sure designation yes um
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know just how far we are off
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
of or whether we have exceeded that and
 
02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
and whether we don't have that issue we
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
are current we are currently attaining
 
02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
at the federal standard um and uh have
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
been for for a number of years I I don't
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
have the dates right off the top of my
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
head but I can uh that's something that
 
02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
we can certainly provide to the
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee and follow up thank you very
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
much any other questions committee
 
02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:31.350 align:start position:0%
much any other questions committee
representative

02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
enom uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
you for being here today so a minute ago
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that if somebody currently
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
fails this test they can apply for a
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
hardship waiver correct extension yes
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
but not
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
everybody that has applied for it has
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
been granted that waiver no no what I
 
02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
said was uh there
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
were uh 62 waivers were granted only 47
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
of them were actually used the in other
 
02:14:06.669 --> 02:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
words 67 people applied got a waiver but
 
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
um 67 minus uh uh 62 I'm sorry uh so uh
 
02:14:16.589 --> 02:14:16.599 align:start position:0%
of of that 62 that were provided only 47
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
actually needed additional time they or
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
they might have sold their vehicle or or
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
scrapped the vehicle or something else
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
but but they didn't actually use the
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
waiver thank you follow up follow up uh
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so can you address what
 
02:14:33.790 --> 02:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
somebody would qualify and not qualify
 
02:14:37.870 --> 02:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
if they app applied for a waiver uh I
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't just you know qualifications for a
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
waiver I believe there's an economic um
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
requirement again we don't administer
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
that it's administered by the department
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
of safety um but I I believe that um you
 
02:14:56.830 --> 02:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
know there's a a percentage of of you
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
know poverty level income uh information
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's required um but I I don't I we
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
can get you that information or as I say
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
the department of safety does administer
 
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
that part if you could please yeah thank
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
you it' be great if you can get us that
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
information good thank you Mr chair do
 
02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
you know how the public is is informed
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
about this waiver process because I can
 
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
tell you that I just last week had an
 
02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
inspection found out I have a faulty
 
02:15:28.589 --> 02:15:28.599 align:start position:0%
Cadillac converter $2,800 on my car and
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
there was nowhere in my briefing when
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
they gave me my 60-day that there was
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
any waiver process that this program was
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
available and to hear that only 60
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
people in the entire state of Applied
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
tells me that the public isn't aware so
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
do you know how that message is getting
 
02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
to the public I believe that that
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
information is on the inspection report
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
but I'm not positive about that I can I
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
can uh and director Mar his staff might
 
02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
be able to um respond to that as well
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly work with them to
 
02:15:59.549 --> 02:15:59.559 align:start position:0%
get that information and I believe
 
02:16:03.549 --> 02:16:03.559 align:start position:0%
there's information on uh on the website
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
um as as well uh we mechanics tell
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
people about it um or or what um I'm I'm
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
not I'm not positive but uh um I do I do
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
believe there's information that you can
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
apply for it on on the inspection report
 
02:16:23.069 --> 02:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you sir thank you
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
very much so with that I have no one
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
else who's uh open to testify on this
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
and just before I close out just to let
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know online we have two constituents
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
who supported and nine who opposed it so
 
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the hearing
 
02:16:40.110 --> 02:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
on HP
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
212 it's 12:15 a little bit behind um so
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
let's just say that our next hearing on
 
02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:51.000 align:start position:0%

03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:20:44.189 --> 03:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
649 excuse me remove any requirement for
 
03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
physical safety inspections and on board
 
03:20:48.349 --> 03:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
diagnostic test for passenger vehicles
 
03:20:50.269 --> 03:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
and eliminating funding for the motor
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle air pollution abatement fund uh
 
03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
before we get started I see a lot of
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
pink cards
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%

blue sheets if you do want to speak uh
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
for the bill who against the bill I need
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
you to fill out one of these pink cards
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
please keep in mind that if you've heard
 
03:21:12.510 --> 03:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
your points being brought up or brought
 
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
up already it's okay to wave off we
 
03:21:16.110 --> 03:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
don't need to hear the same points over
 
03:21:18.189 --> 03:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
and over and over that being said
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
welcome again to
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh chair recognizes
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative Granger the prime sponsor
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
and Jeremy Olen to uh to introduce
 
03:21:30.750 --> 03:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee so the premise of this bill is
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
that we should not have vehicle
 
03:21:38.670 --> 03:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
emissions or safety inspections anymore
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
I consider them a scam very plain and
 
03:21:42.229 --> 03:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
simple I think that the vehicle safety
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
inspections are scamed they're mostly
 
03:21:45.870 --> 03:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
used as a way to get money from our
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
citizens and give them to uh some
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
mechanics who are perhaps less honest
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
there are very honest mechanics out
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
there and then there's less honest
 
03:21:55.710 --> 03:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
mechanics but some there's a lot of
 
03:21:57.630 --> 03:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
victims of dishonest mechanics who use
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the inspections as a front in order to
 
03:22:02.670 --> 03:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
extract money from unsuspecting
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
customers so the way we this sort of
 
03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill has been brought up in the past
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
however it usually was done in a way
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
where they added a line to the rsas that
 
03:22:13.990 --> 03:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
says something along the lines of
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles are are exempt from
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
inspection c s as a general rule I try
 
03:22:21.670 --> 03:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
to repeal if if I want to fix a problem
 
03:22:23.309 --> 03:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
with law I would prefer repealing
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
something rather than adding additional
 
03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
language um because it makes things nice
 
03:22:29.070 --> 03:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
and clean so that is what we attempted
 
03:22:31.269 --> 03:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill we tried to repeal
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
any language that authorize the
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
existence of inspections and do it in a
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
way that's nice and tidy and clean up
 
03:22:39.870 --> 03:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
any Loose Ends um Jeremy Olson who was
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
next to me uh did a lot of the research
 
03:22:43.790 --> 03:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
for the bill and wrote A lot of it he uh
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
was the former research director for the
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liberty Alliance so he's
 
03:22:49.870 --> 03:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed thousands of bills and uh so he
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
helped me out with this one quite a bit
 
03:22:52.590 --> 03:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
and so it was a team effort and that's
 
03:22:54.830 --> 03:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
why he's introducing it with me all
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
right good afternoon ladies and
 
03:22:58.189 --> 03:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee as the
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative said um my name is Jeremy
 
03:23:04.389 --> 03:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
Olson and um I'm from Manchester w 11
 
03:23:07.189 --> 03:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
and um I helped write this bill and um
 
03:23:08.830 --> 03:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
I've worked I've um worked on this type
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
of stuff since 2007 I've worked with the
 
03:23:12.550 --> 03:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liberty Alliance reviewing
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
a multitude of bills on different topics
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
I've worked with um a group called
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
Americans of prosperity and I served on
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
the board of an organization called
 
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
citizens of Criminal Justice Reform we
 
03:23:24.670 --> 03:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
in particular tackled bills concerning
 
03:23:26.269 --> 03:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
problems in the prison system problems
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
of how offenders are treated after they
 
03:23:29.670 --> 03:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
get out of prison and so on so I've been
 
03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
working on legislation quite a while
 
03:23:35.229 --> 03:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
here so as the topic of this bill um
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
simply put car inspections do not
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
increase Motor Vehicle Safety at this
 
03:23:42.590 --> 03:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
point only 11 out of 50 states still
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
have these types of safety inspections
 
03:23:46.189 --> 03:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
only 11 states do these on an annual
 
03:23:46.199 --> 03:23:47.150 align:start position:0%
only 11 states do these on an annual
basis

03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
several States including New Jersey and
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
Texas have eliminated them in the past
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
decade they impose an owner financial
 
03:23:57.750 --> 03:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
burden on motorists not only the flat 40
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
to $50 fee which is basically a
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
regressive tax on all of our citizens
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
but then the potential for having to
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
deal with a mechanic who tells you you
 
03:24:08.590 --> 03:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
need two three $5,000 worth of repairs
 
03:24:11.070 --> 03:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
on your car um hundreds of people have
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
stories of being ripped off by un
 
03:24:15.150 --> 03:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous mechanics of having their
 
03:24:16.950 --> 03:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
car essentially held hostage
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
some of these people are here to testify
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
today um last year I was at a hearing
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
for a much more watered down bill and I
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
remember both representative Sellers and
 
03:24:28.950 --> 03:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
Coker had testified that they have many
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
people the constituents that had called
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
them about problems with inspections
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are a multitude of people out
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
there that have problems dealing with
 
03:24:38.110 --> 03:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
the inspection system and so that's why
 
03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to go the law is
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
massively unpopular and repealing it is
 
03:24:45.389 --> 03:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
very popular as of noon 167 people had
 
03:24:47.469 --> 03:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
filled out the online submission form in
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and only 55 had
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
filled it out opposed that's a 3 to1
 
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
ratio of people coming out in favor
 
03:24:55.229 --> 03:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
versus opposed to this bill one of the
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
biggest problems the inspection
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
requirement has no due process there's
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
no certain way to get a second opinion a
 
03:25:03.030 --> 03:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
lot of mechanics will not look at your
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
car if they know it's already been
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
plugged in by a different mechanic
 
03:25:06.670 --> 03:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to be accused of
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
people Forum Shopping and there's no
 
03:25:12.030 --> 03:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
actual legal appeals process through the
 
03:25:14.189 --> 03:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
DMV to get a second opinion or to have a
 
03:25:15.790 --> 03:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
court review the thing and override the
 
03:25:15.800 --> 03:25:16.870 align:start position:0%
court review the thing and override the
mechanic

03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
mechanic
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's a complaint line r by the
 
03:25:21.150 --> 03:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
dealership Association virtually nobody
 
03:25:22.830 --> 03:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
knows about it we heard testimony at a
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill earlier that there's like a
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
hardship waiver if people need a longer
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
delay there's 1.4 million people in the
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
state only 67 people I believe applied
 
03:25:33.469 --> 03:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
for the hardship W so clearly people
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
don't know about that either so in my
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
opinion it's time for these safety
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
inspections to go um some some of the
 
03:25:43.269 --> 03:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that's been submitted um
 
03:25:44.990 --> 03:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
through the electronic form and I can
 
03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
also email this out to every I'm just
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
going to go with this real briefly a um
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
a former New Hampshire police officer
 
03:25:53.189 --> 03:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
who worked for the State Police for 35
 
03:25:54.910 --> 03:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
years and he worked on the inspection
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
system within the state police he said
 
03:26:00.269 --> 03:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
that in the 35 years that he's worked on
 
03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
inspections that in his professional
 
03:26:04.910 --> 03:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
career thousands of forensic vehicle
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
inspections have revealed no more than
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
four vehicles which revealed component
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
failure and these were all registered in
 
03:26:14.590 --> 03:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
state mandating safety inspections and
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
he went on for seven pages with tons of
 
03:26:18.670 --> 03:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
facts and statistics I'll email that out
 
03:26:20.030 --> 03:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
to everybody and it's in the electronic
 
03:26:21.550 --> 03:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
submission form so I won't read all that
 
03:26:24.910 --> 03:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
in today but that's yes if you guys know
 
03:26:25.950 --> 03:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
him so there's a lot of people who' have
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
been on this committee for a while it's
 
03:26:28.429 --> 03:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
Brian chase you might have heard him
 
03:26:30.189 --> 03:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
testifying bills in the past he used to
 
03:26:31.550 --> 03:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
run the emissions in the safety
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
inspection program in New Hampshire yep
 
03:26:36.429 --> 03:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
so yeah we have plenty of stats and
 
03:26:39.870 --> 03:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
stuff like that um one thing I wanted to
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
go very briefly the bill is rather long
 
03:26:45.630 --> 03:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
the way it's written and the way that OS
 
03:26:48.189 --> 03:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
drafted is is a little bit unintuitive
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
if um people want to look at the bill
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
and if you turn to page three line
 
03:26:55.550 --> 03:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
22 that's where the actual repeals begin
 
03:26:57.429 --> 03:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
they put the Amendments on the top and
 
03:26:59.469 --> 03:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
the repeals on the bottom so if you look
 
03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
at the bill um starting with line 27 it
 
03:27:05.150 --> 03:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
repeals RSA 2661 which is what
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
authorizes the inspections it then goes
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
through on the next few lines and it
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
repeals a bunch of details concerning
 
03:27:14.830 --> 03:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
things like fees spare tires and stuff
 
03:27:17.309 --> 03:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
like that it repeals to
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
2668 what's important here that's very
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
important to understand this bill leaves
 
03:27:25.110 --> 03:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the Statue all of the equipment of
 
03:27:27.389 --> 03:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles's requirements it just gets rid
 
03:27:29.469 --> 03:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
of the preemptive inspection and the
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
requirement to have an inspection
 
03:27:35.150 --> 03:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
sticker so our police can still enforce
 
03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
equipment of vehicles problems they can
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
pull people over they can ticket them
 
03:27:41.070 --> 03:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
for problems um there's like under one
 
03:27:42.910 --> 03:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the other rsas is a negligent driving
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
statue if somebody's driving down the
 
03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
street with no headlights at the middle
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
of the night can be pulled over for that
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
so this will not getting rid of the
 
03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
inspections will not make our roads
 
03:27:52.670 --> 03:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
anymore unsafe because we still have all
 
03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
the requirements that people have safe
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
Vehicles what it does do is it prevents
 
03:27:57.870 --> 03:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
mechanics of being able to fail your
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle because there's a spot of
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
surface rust that doesn't mean anything
 
03:28:03.389 --> 03:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
or any other problems like that so then
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
um that goes on through um the end of
 
03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:07.150 align:start position:0%
um that goes on through um the end of
the

03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:10.349 --> 03:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
bill back on the first page what it's
 
03:28:14.269 --> 03:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
doing there is it's repealing different
 
03:28:19.710 --> 03:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
bits and pieces of uh RSA
 
03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
125s which is a um do you remember what
 
03:28:26.070 --> 03:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
the name of the fund is air fund the air
 
03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
pollution the vehicle air pollution
 
03:28:29.710 --> 03:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
abatement fund yes so one of the things
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
the bill does is it repeals the funding
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
for that fund but it leaves the fund
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
intact so we made sure the the purpose
 
03:28:37.590 --> 03:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
of that was I wanted to leave the
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
committee and the committee that's going
 
03:28:40.229 --> 03:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
to be receiving this bill after this a
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
lot of leeway to decide exactly what
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
they want to do with that fund because
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
there's already money in that fund and
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get rid of a fund that
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
has money in it that doesn't make a lot
 
03:28:50.229 --> 03:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
of sense we do have amendments that
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to offer to finance as to
 
03:28:53.349 --> 03:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
ways to get rid of that which would
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate the fiscal note on this bill
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
um however I I figured that this
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
committee probably wouldn't want to deal
 
03:28:59.710 --> 03:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
with that and leave it you since it's
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to a second committee anyway um
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
just know that we do have amendments on
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
the ready to help them to if if they
 
03:29:07.309 --> 03:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
want to keep that fund around or if they
 
03:29:10.590 --> 03:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
don't up to them yep and finally it
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
makes a change to RSA
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
358-a 2 this is on page two at line at
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
line four through line 21 and what this
 
03:29:21.429 --> 03:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
is doing is it currently allows a
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
customer to request that a dealer
 
03:29:25.229 --> 03:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
perform a safety in inspection of a
 
03:29:27.189 --> 03:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle potentially at the customer own
 
03:29:28.670 --> 03:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
expense if they believe the vehicle they
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
wish to buy is unsafe the amendment here
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
simply removes reference to inspection
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
stickers and update some of the RSA
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and then it replaces the word
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
required with requested later on that's
 
03:29:41.070 --> 03:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
just so that people still have that that
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
privilege to ask a dealer if they think
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
the car is unsafe they can have them
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
inspect it but again we moving um
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
references to like inspection inspection
 
03:29:51.229 --> 03:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
sticker all throughout the statue so
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's my explanation of how the bill
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
was written and um just a couple stories
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
I want to tell the committee about my
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
own um knowledge of how these
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
inspections go so I bought a car from a
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
dealer in Manchester autoare Honda and
 
03:30:07.150 --> 03:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
the car looked like it was in great
 
03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
condition they put an inspection sticker
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
on it two weeks after I bought the car
 
03:30:12.189 --> 03:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
so I sort of have the opposite problem
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
two weeks after I bought the car the
 
03:30:15.389 --> 03:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
entire exhaust system split off right
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
behind the cat a converter this car had
 
03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
a brand new inspection sticker on it so
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
I looked up the laws I looked up the
 
03:30:22.349 --> 03:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
rules I went back to them and I talked
 
03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
to him and I told them very clearly I
 
03:30:26.189 --> 03:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
know the law says they put a sticker on
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
there I had an independent mechanic look
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
at it and put it in writing that that
 
03:30:32.189 --> 03:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
was about two years worth of rust
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
through the exhaust system not two weeks
 
03:30:36.269 --> 03:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
wor the rust and so they went and fixed
 
03:30:38.229 --> 03:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and no expense to myself
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then put a fresh inspection sticker
 
03:30:41.389 --> 03:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
on there they were also aware that they
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
were supposed to put a sticker on in the
 
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
following year because I had bought the
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
car less than 16 months the next date
 
03:30:48.750 --> 03:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the inspection stickers do so these
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
guys are basically putting a sticker on
 
03:30:51.870 --> 03:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
the car without truly doing an
 
03:30:53.710 --> 03:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
inspection and they didn't even know the
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
law about what the time delays are for
 
03:30:58.389 --> 03:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
the stickers I know somebody else that
 
03:30:59.870 --> 03:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
had a problem with a check engine like
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
he can't be here today so I was just
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to bring this in up briefly he had
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
a Volkswagen TDI check engine light
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
comes on for an environmental problem
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
environmental sensor problem on the car
 
03:31:10.950 --> 03:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
he spend thousands of dollars trying to
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
fix this car there was absolutely
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with it other than this
 
03:31:15.150 --> 03:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
light was coming on he placed like an
 
03:31:17.070 --> 03:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
oxygen sensor they worked on the wiring
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
they did some stuff with the computer he
 
03:31:21.150 --> 03:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
finally ended up selling this perfectly
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
functioning car out of state I think to
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
somebody in Connecticut because he could
 
03:31:26.309 --> 03:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
not get this car to be Road worthy in
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire according to the laws he
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
spent more money on this car than like
 
03:31:30.750 --> 03:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
what the insurance company would
 
03:31:33.269 --> 03:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
consider a total value for the car and
 
03:31:34.429 --> 03:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more stories from other
 
03:31:35.790 --> 03:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
people here today this is the kind of
 
03:31:37.790 --> 03:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
stuff people have to deal with you got
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
the the so-called lick it and stick it
 
03:31:40.750 --> 03:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
places that'll put a sticker on there
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
and it didn't actually pass you got the
 
03:31:44.189 --> 03:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
people that do the exact opposite where
 
03:31:45.550 --> 03:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
they won't pass the car because they're
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
trying to buil money out of people and
 
03:31:49.229 --> 03:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
they know people are ignorant about cars
 
03:31:51.389 --> 03:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
so um that's everything I have to say
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
about this bill the inspection system as
 
03:31:55.590 --> 03:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
my friend here said it's a scam we need
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
to get rid of it it doesn't make people
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
safer we have statistics on that we have
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
stories about other people's problems um
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's I have to say and I'd be more than
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
03:32:06.429 --> 03:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much any
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank you Mr
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you could you elaborate on
 
03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
the comment you made about if people
 
03:32:17.070 --> 03:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
fail it one
 
03:32:19.309 --> 03:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
shop and they want to go to another
 
03:32:20.910 --> 03:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
place because they disagree with what
 
03:32:22.990 --> 03:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
they were failed for what what happens
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
so what you what you imply it happens
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative so what I've heard
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
through other people and from mechanics
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
is when the car is plugged into the
 
03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
computer system to be inspected when
 
03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
they plug in for the OBD it creates a
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
record in State's database that the car
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
is being inspected and then if it fails
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to go in there other
 
03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
mechanics are and other mechanics can
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
see this if you bring your car to that
 
03:32:48.830 --> 03:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
station so if you go to a different
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
station they can look up the fact that
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
your car has been failed somewhere else
 
03:32:55.550 --> 03:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
because the state can come down on
 
03:32:56.670 --> 03:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
mechanics that look like they're
 
03:32:58.750 --> 03:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulently giving out stickers
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
mechanics are very very hesitant to take
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
on somebody's car if it failed a couple
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
days earlier at another station because
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
they might get audited they might have
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
the state police show up and look at how
 
03:33:09.150 --> 03:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
they're running their business there
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
because they basically people might be
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
doing like a Forum Shopping type thing
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
where they're just looking for somebody
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to pass a car so that I've
 
03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
heard from several mechanics and I know
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
some other people have stories about
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
that probably testifying today to to
 
03:33:22.750 --> 03:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
expand on that it so basically if you
 
03:33:24.269 --> 03:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
have if you happen to run into one of
 
03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
those mechanics that uh is more likely
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
to fail you just so they can make a
 
03:33:29.950 --> 03:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
quick Buck even if you sense that
 
03:33:31.990 --> 03:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're lying to you which most like if
 
03:33:33.189 --> 03:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
you have a lie detector you can tell
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
someone's lying to you if you know that
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
they're lying to you and you look and
 
03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
you say well no there's no problem with
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
that at all if you take it to another
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
mechanic good luck getting it to pass so
 
03:33:42.990 --> 03:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
they kind of they kind of Tainted your
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle and it can cost you a fortune to
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
get it fixed
 
03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:48.550 align:start position:0%
get it fixed
thank

03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:33:50.830 --> 03:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none seeing none thank
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to go through we have a
 
03:34:00.910 --> 03:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
few Representatives also would like to
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
testify assuming they have other
 
03:34:05.229 --> 03:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
important business to do I'll take them
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
up first uh chair recognizes
 
03:34:06.840 --> 03:34:07.990 align:start position:0%
up first uh chair recognizes
representative

03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:34:11.469 --> 03:34:11.479 align:start position:0%
sellers you had to leave I'll put him
 
03:34:11.479 --> 03:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
sellers you had to leave I'll put him
aside

03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure Representative Sam begins
 
03:34:27.189 --> 03:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
with an F who would that
 
03:34:29.830 --> 03:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
be has in support of the
 
03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:31.910 align:start position:0%
be has in support of the
bill

03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:34.469 --> 03:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
um good good afternoon sir thank you Mr
 
03:34:35.950 --> 03:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
chair your last name my name is Sam
 
03:34:38.710 --> 03:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
farington I represent Rochester Ward 4
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of the bill uh the
 
03:34:44.590 --> 03:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and his I guess assistant
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
went into good details about the
 
03:34:49.950 --> 03:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
research that has gone along with this
 
03:34:53.309 --> 03:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
but it's a regressive tax not just a $40
 
03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
inspection fee but also the repairs that
 
03:34:58.349 --> 03:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
as we know go into thousands and
 
03:35:00.510 --> 03:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for maybe a scratch
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
or a crack on your bumper or some Rust
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a regressive tax and it's
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
a tax on low-income people on young
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
people and for the sake of our economy
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
for personal Liberty we need to get rid
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
of this it is inefficient it's
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and we should follow a suit
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
as the other states have thank you thank
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
you sir any
 
03:35:29.229 --> 03:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative St Clair real
 
03:35:30.790 --> 03:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
quick you mentioned the other states you
 
03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
how many other states do not have any
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
form of vehicle
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
inspection I believe uh Jeremy said 15
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
states have a form of this so that mean
 
03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
35 roughly thank you I missed that thank
 
03:35:45.319 --> 03:35:46.550 align:start position:0%
35 roughly thank you I missed that thank
you

03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
I thought he said 11 but who knows uh
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee seeing
 
03:36:02.990 --> 03:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
much once again courteous for people's
 
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
time constraints Michael Fitzgerald the
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
Services not taking a position on the
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
bill and with uh with testimony emailed
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
then good afternoon again uh thank you
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman members of the
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee once again Mike fitzerald
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the Resources
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
Division uh you've heard my testimony on
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
the three prior bills relative to uh
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
altering the emissions inspection
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
program again we don't take a position
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
on this and we're not addressing the
 
03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
safety portion of that um as I've
 
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously we operate the
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
emissions inspection in conjunction with
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety uh at the same
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
time as the physical inspection is
 
03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:46.510 align:start position:0%
time as the physical inspection is
conducted

03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
um as I've told you previously the uh
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
emissions inspection is a requirement of
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act it's in our federally
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh approved State implementation plan
 
03:36:59.309 --> 03:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
for uh meeting the requirements of the
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act uh as I have testified
 
03:37:05.469 --> 03:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
previously we would have to negotiate uh
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
with the EPA to uh determine the
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
emissions reductions that uh would be
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
lost as a result of this uh uh
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
elimination of the inspection and then
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
replace those from some other sector
 
03:37:22.830 --> 03:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
however I would state that uh and again
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
I've stated this previously I'm
 
03:37:24.479 --> 03:37:25.429 align:start position:0%
I've stated this previously I'm
repeating

03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
repeating
 
03:37:28.710 --> 03:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
myself on all these bills the Clean Air
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
Act as a result of the fact that New
 
03:37:31.950 --> 03:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is located in the ozone
 
03:37:35.469 --> 03:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
transport region requires that the state
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh and all the states
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the OTR have a vehicle emissions
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
inspection program there are some
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
differences between programs and so on
 
03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
and we negotiated the best deal that we
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
could get with the EPA when we entered
 
03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
into this uh uh um requirement as a
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
result of our non-attainment status that
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
um was we previously talked about in the
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
last hearing and um I'm highly doubtful
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to get approval
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
for EPA for complete elimination of the
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
emissions inspection program um that's
 
03:38:09.389 --> 03:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
just U my opinion I'm working with them
 
03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
and and um I understand that uh you know
 
03:38:15.189 --> 03:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
things may be different uh uh at at this
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
point in time but um it's very clear the
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act is very clear and unless
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
the ACT is changed or or eliminated or
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
this section of the ACT is changed um we
 
03:38:27.870 --> 03:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
are uh required to have an A missions
 
03:38:30.990 --> 03:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
inspection program and uh relative to
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
the motor vehical abatement fund the uh
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um I I did uh prepare part
 
03:38:39.150 --> 03:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note 25 cents of each
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
inspection goes to Dees for
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
administration of this program and for
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
administration of other motor vehicle
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
related programs
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
um uh to to reduce emissions and we
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
probably have uh three staff currently
 
03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh um working on this program and other
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle related programs that
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
would be um eliminated with the loss of
 
03:39:04.590 --> 03:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
those funds um so um with that I will
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
and and I also um I think it's important
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
to note No Matter What EPA does um I'm
 
03:39:12.189 --> 03:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
sure New Hampshire would be sued the
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act does allow for citizen
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
suits and those those suits um uh could
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
would um most likely be brought to
 
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
require the EPA to enforce the
 
03:39:26.429 --> 03:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
requirement for this whether they wanted
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
to or not um so I think that's probably
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
a bigger concern um and we'd be forced
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
to defend ourselves against those suits
 
03:39:38.830 --> 03:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
as well so um with that uh I appreciate
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Indulgence to as I have another
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
hearing at 1:30 upstairs and uh I'd be
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any question questions and
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
I also have Jessica Wilcox here with me
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
who manages this program for us and
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
she'll be staying if there are any
 
03:39:54.550 --> 03:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
further questions for us so I'd be happy
 
03:39:55.950 --> 03:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
to address any questions if you have
 
03:39:59.550 --> 03:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
them now though thank you sir I've got
 
03:40:01.030 --> 03:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
one I've been doing this a long time
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's the first time I heard the
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
thought of being sued can you go over
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
what the Clean Air Act says and who can
 
03:40:11.469 --> 03:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
sue the Clean Air the first time I've
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
heard this yeah the Clean Air and this
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's happened quite often Clean Air Act
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
allows for citizen suits it allows for
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
basically anyone who's impacted or
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
affected so if it would be a citizen of
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or an organization one of
 
03:40:28.110 --> 03:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
the advocacy organizations perhaps um it
 
03:40:32.110 --> 03:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
does allow them to file suit and uh uh
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
the uh they you know if there were a
 
03:40:37.510 --> 03:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
judgment under the suit then EPA would
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
enter into an agreement um uh a
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement whereby they would
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
um uh you you know acknowledge that
 
03:40:48.750 --> 03:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement to to implement
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
this and that they would they would
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
enforce it and there would be I I assume
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
there'd be some time table uh and and
 
03:40:57.349 --> 03:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
there already is a timetable established
 
03:41:00.070 --> 03:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
for the Clean Air Act provides for
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
sanctions um so if we don't have a
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
federally approved program um they can
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
sanction the state and there's an
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
18-month clock that would be triggered
 
03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
and after that they could uh uh withhold
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway funding for New
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so but the citizen suits um
 
03:41:22.149 --> 03:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
would probably be the the quickest
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
remedy that that uh uh people who
 
03:41:28.830 --> 03:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
opposed this would would use to go that
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
go after the EPA and us to to require us
 
03:41:33.309 --> 03:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
to enforce the
 
03:41:35.710 --> 03:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
program what would some of those impacts
 
03:41:38.309 --> 03:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
be that they could use for lawsuits
 
03:41:39.630 --> 03:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
what's what is an impact that would be
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate air emissions uh air
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
quality problems exacerbation of of um
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
of our equality status that those kind
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
of things I would think that there would
 
03:41:53.950 --> 03:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
be um you know the Clean Air Act is
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
intended to require these emissions
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
reductions in order for us to achieve
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
Federal standards and so um it would be
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
a the the lawsuits would most likely be
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
have a health basis I would I would
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate okay so claims of my my
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
asthma's worse now oh yeah or yeah yeah
 
03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
I these would not necessarily be
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits particularly saying
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I have asthma or whatever
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
but the lawsuits would say that the
 
03:42:22.710 --> 03:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act is intended to reduce
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
emissions in order to protect citizens
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
and to achieve Federal air quality
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
standards and you're not doing that and
 
03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act requires it so the
 
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuit would be to require us to meet
 
03:42:36.269 --> 03:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the Clean Air Act
 
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
but it would probably cite Health
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
impacts as
 
03:42:41.429 --> 03:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
reason last one for me sure I'm being
 
03:42:44.359 --> 03:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
reason last one for me sure I'm being
selfish

03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
selfish
 
03:42:48.429 --> 03:42:48.439 align:start position:0%
um I know recently when we've had these
 
03:42:49.950 --> 03:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
bills we've been talking about
 
03:42:52.189 --> 03:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
renegotiating with the Clean Air Act etc
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
etc but you just mentioned again the
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
actual loss of Highway funds yes do we
 
03:43:01.229 --> 03:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
have a number yet on what that would
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
look like how many how much but we I've
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
been asking for 12 years nobody's ever
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
been able to tell
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
me I've been doing this for a long time
 
03:43:11.309 --> 03:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
and I know many years ago the number for
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was on the order of $100
 
03:43:16.149 --> 03:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
million annually Plus or minus I I don't
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
know if there's someone from dot um U
 
03:43:22.469 --> 03:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
and I don't that figure is probably 10
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
years old um it's very significant
 
03:43:26.790 --> 03:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
though the New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
Highway funding um portion uh almost all
 
03:43:34.269 --> 03:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
of our Interstate work and so on as it's
 
03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding is done using
 
03:43:38.830 --> 03:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 90% federal dollars the
 
03:43:41.309 --> 03:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
Improvement of i93
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
Etc and those funds could be
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
withheld again I'm not saying the EPA
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
wants to do that but they could be
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
forced to if if there was a lawsuit and
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
and they were found to have not uh met
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the
 
03:43:59.070 --> 03:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
ACT well I'll follow up with you later I
 
03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
know time is of the essence certain it's
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
hard me to believe that they would take
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
all of our funding away if we didn't
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
have an inspection program but
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
nonetheless representative Miller thank
 
03:44:09.030 --> 03:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for coming
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
if I told you recently the 5-year moving
 
03:44:13.950 --> 03:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
average was approximately $225 million
 
03:44:16.830 --> 03:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
per year would you be surp surprised uh
 
03:44:18.910 --> 03:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
I would not be surprised as I said the
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
figure that I cited was probably 10
 
03:44:25.389 --> 03:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
years older or so um yeah that's that's
 
03:44:26.670 --> 03:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
not a surprising
 
03:44:29.590 --> 03:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
figure representative G thank you Mr
 
03:44:32.110 --> 03:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
chair so my understanding right now is
 
03:44:35.149 --> 03:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
that the uh the OBD um the onboard
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
diagnostic electric diagnostic is
 
03:44:39.630 --> 03:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
basically the system of record for the
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
emissions is that correct that's correct
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
followup follow up so we are not
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
actually doing true emissions testing at
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
this point in time um if if that's the
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
case because you know something causing
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
an electrical malfunction which throws
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
you check engine light on does not
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh even most of the time
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
change your emissions would that be true
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
no the uh check engine light the onboard
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
diagnostics light on your vehicle only
 
03:45:07.189 --> 03:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
illuminates when uh some component of
 
03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
the vehicle has uh malfunction that
 
03:45:12.189 --> 03:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
would cause your emissions to increase
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
by uh 1.5 times the federal standard
 
03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
um the check engine light is only
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
related to
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
emissions no that's any other questions
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:45:31.110 --> 03:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
question if if I could just
 
03:45:33.389 --> 03:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
sure it's not solely related to
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
emissions controls things like spark
 
03:45:40.990 --> 03:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
plugs T engine timing um uh you know all
 
03:45:44.149 --> 03:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
trans transmission issues and so on can
 
03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
affect the can affect the engine and can
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
affect emissions so it's it's the OBD is
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
a uh thousands of components of the
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle are covered by OBD but those
 
03:45:57.630 --> 03:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
failure of those components would result
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
in in an emissions
 
03:46:03.189 --> 03:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
increase I'm sorry go ahead no that's
 
03:46:05.670 --> 03:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
fine thank for taking my question sure
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that um that that
 
03:46:13.309 --> 03:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
test that got us to a an enhanced level
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes um is by count County I'm wondering
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
if there's possibility of within New
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire having some counties
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
participate in that and some counties
 
03:46:25.229 --> 03:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
don't uh the the New Hampshire
 
03:46:27.309 --> 03:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
requirement is actually for the southern
 
03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
four counties of of New Hampshire um
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
when the emissions inspection program
 
03:46:37.070 --> 03:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
was implemented as I mentioned we uh
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
went into a negotiation with EPA they
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
did start the sanctions clock on us um
 
03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
back in
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
1998 and then representative Jeb Bradley
 
03:46:48.030 --> 03:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
as the uh chair of the house science
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
negotiated an agreement points with EPA
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
whereby we would Implement a uh the OBD
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
emissions inspection program instead of
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
the physical emissions testing program
 
03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
there were several other pieces to that
 
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
component some reductions at at marac
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
station we're part of that agreement um
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
and uh so the we we arrived at a
 
03:47:15.269 --> 03:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
compromise with EPA that they found that
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
they were able to approve at that time
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
um uh so in order for us to avoid the
 
03:47:25.229 --> 03:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
more honorous uh emissions uh you know
 
03:47:27.550 --> 03:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
plugin emissions testing tailpipe
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
testing type
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
program um so we're already uh doing
 
03:47:35.550 --> 03:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
less than the ACT actually requires but
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
um that was a negotiation and and we
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
were able to get that through U between
 
03:47:41.590 --> 03:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bradley and the
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
administrator of the EPA
 
03:47:48.550 --> 03:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
follow up so um it was originally set up
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
for just the four counties is that what
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
you said uh under the agreement we
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
agreed to do Statewide because we were
 
03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
doing less so that that was part of the
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
agreement was was to implement the
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
program Statewide
 
03:48:05.229 --> 03:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
1998 uh the agreement was in 1998 we
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
actually implemented the program in the
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
20032 2004 time
 
03:48:12.550 --> 03:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
frame represent
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
pyo thank you Mr chair thank you taking
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
my question um throughout your testimony
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned attainment versus
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
non-attainment and I to assume that
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
means attainment means getting New
 
03:48:27.630 --> 03:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire out of the ozone transport
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
zone no no um attainment refers to our
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
status with regard to the federal ozone
 
03:48:36.870 --> 03:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
standard so EPA sets a standard um as I
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously they review it
 
03:48:41.469 --> 03:48:41.479 align:start position:0%
every five years uh and they and they
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
look at the science and so on and
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
determine what what the standard should
 
03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:45.229 align:start position:0%
determine what what the standard should
be

03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
when I first started the standard was
 
03:48:49.149 --> 03:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the order of 125 parts per
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
billion uh on a on a 8 Hour average
 
03:48:56.110 --> 03:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
today it's 70 parts per billion but each
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
time they revise the standard we have to
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
determine whether we're meeting that
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
standard and that's done through
 
03:49:04.590 --> 03:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
measurements around the state and when
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then we certify that we're either
 
03:49:07.870 --> 03:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
meeting it which is no know as
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
attainment we're attaining the standard
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
um or we're not meeting it which is what
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
I refer to as non-attainment
 
03:49:17.790 --> 03:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
so if we are above 70 parts per billion
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
on on a rolling eight hour average based
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
on our monitoring around the state we
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
have 13 monitors in various locations
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
around the state and um based on that
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
data uh and a three-year running average
 
03:49:33.149 --> 03:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
of that data uh we we compare that to
 
03:49:35.710 --> 03:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
the standard and determine whether we're
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
either attaining or non- attaining and
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
then there's a separate requirement for
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:46.189 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:49:46.189 --> 03:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:49:48.750 --> 03:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Jack uh thank
 
03:49:50.590 --> 03:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
you uh the Public Works committee would
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Miller that
 
03:49:55.229 --> 03:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
225 is the right
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
number that was a great question thank
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
you very
 
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
much h no other question I stand
 
03:50:03.070 --> 03:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
corrected seeing then thank you very
 
03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much sir I
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.790 --> 03:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
Indulgence uh next up chair recognizes
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%

03:50:25.030 --> 03:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh Dan Bennett New
 
03:50:27.990 --> 03:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Auto Dealers Association as
 
03:50:29.229 --> 03:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
you know we're a trade Association
 
03:50:31.110 --> 03:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
representing the motor vehicle industry
 
03:50:33.710 --> 03:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh and we're here
 
03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
as expected opposed to HB 649 um as we
 
03:50:39.309 --> 03:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
have in the past anytime the repeals the
 
03:50:41.429 --> 03:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
annual vehicle safety inspection program
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
has been proposed um I do have handouts
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the committee that I'll leave
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the clerk when I'm done uh speaking
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
as they're filled with a great deal of
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
data and facts related to the program um
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
this program is one that benefits
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
consumers it supports law enforcement
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it helps keep our road safe uh we
 
03:51:01.229 --> 03:51:01.239 align:start position:0%
all know that preventative maintenance
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
costs less than catastrophic repair
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
right it's why you go to the doctor
 
03:51:07.229 --> 03:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance that's what
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
this program is about it's about having
 
03:51:11.389 --> 03:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
a trained expert look over your vehicle
 
03:51:13.710 --> 03:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
identify problems um and get them
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
corrected as as soon as possible there's
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
some real value to the program that
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
you've heard us talk about before one
 
03:51:21.910 --> 03:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
being safety recall information there's
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of safety recalls
 
03:51:26.349 --> 03:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
that occur um Toyota announced on
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
Tacomas this morning 100,000 Tacomas in
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
the 24 model year uh for leaking brake
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
fluid they they they come out on a daily
 
03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
basis when you receive an annual safety
 
03:51:38.110 --> 03:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
inspection the the Gordon Derby the OBD2
 
03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
program runs a check with Nitsa based on
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
the VIN number for that specific vehicle
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
whether there's an open safety data
 
03:51:46.910 --> 03:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
recall and whether it's been repaired on
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
your exact vehicle not just in general
 
03:51:52.269 --> 03:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
not just Acadia that specific vehicle so
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
it has tremendous value that way um in
 
03:51:57.469 --> 03:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
2022 through the program when the uh
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
safety recall notification process
 
03:52:01.990 --> 03:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
started there were 36,000 uh notices
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
given to citizens in 2023 there are
 
03:52:08.110 --> 03:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
21,000 in 2024 there are over 10,000 and
 
03:52:10.590 --> 03:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
this year already you know a month and
 
03:52:14.149 --> 03:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
11 days there's already been uh 465
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
safety recalls handed uh and and put in
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
front of uh citizens so not just the
 
03:52:21.309 --> 03:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
little postcard that shows up in the
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
mailbox this is on the vehicle
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
inspection report that every customer
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
gets when they get a safety inspection
 
03:52:29.229 --> 03:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
so it's tremendously um it it's
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
tremendously um helpful information and
 
03:52:34.389 --> 03:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
helps uh consumers get them fixed and
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
get that problem fixed um on the
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's dime the manufacturer
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
pays for it not the consumer so um
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things it's important to know
 
03:52:48.189 --> 03:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
we talk about states that don't have
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
safety inspections um all of our
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
neighboring states have inspections uh
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
and they do it for a reason you've heard
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
me before talk about our climate our
 
03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
climate is unique it's why all of our
 
03:52:59.790 --> 03:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors have these programs um I heard
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
someone mention New Jersey scrapped
 
03:53:02.750 --> 03:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
their program and they did New Jersey
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
scra their their program a handful of
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
years ago because it was a state-run
 
03:53:09.710 --> 03:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
program with Union employees that cost
 
03:53:13.030 --> 03:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state $9 million a year the New
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire solution is a free market
 
03:53:16.189 --> 03:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
Market it's a free market program where
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
a small business sets up they decide to
 
03:53:20.990 --> 03:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
elect receive training become certified
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed by State Police and become a
 
03:53:25.630 --> 03:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
safety inspector um if there's a failure
 
03:53:27.389 --> 03:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
at that shop and it's identified to the
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
customer it's the customer's choice no
 
03:53:32.149 --> 03:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
one's held hostage you have the decision
 
03:53:34.590 --> 03:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
to shop it to get it you can do the
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
repair on your own they're allowed to
 
03:53:38.710 --> 03:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
leave they they have the option to get
 
03:53:41.110 --> 03:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
it repaired either with that mechanic if
 
03:53:43.229 --> 03:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
they choose to or they can shop the
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
price or do it on their own so that's an
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
important component um of the program as
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
well the state doesn't set the rate the
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
the the shops do so uh vote with your
 
03:53:55.149 --> 03:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
wallet if you don't like what you hear
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
um you know what we have seen in other
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
states too and I think you heard from
 
03:54:01.710 --> 03:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
some folks for the standards remain the
 
03:54:04.149 --> 03:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
same right so now it's on law
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement roadside or while traveling
 
03:54:09.910 --> 03:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
to enforce that so what this this
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
proposal here invites is um is increase
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement scrutiny
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
so um I did give you a bunch of facts
 
03:54:19.710 --> 03:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
but here I'll give you some opinion I
 
03:54:21.070 --> 03:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
don't think a whole lot of people want
 
03:54:23.389 --> 03:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
increased law enforcement scrutiny right
 
03:54:25.149 --> 03:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
so that's what this program would uh
 
03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
provide it could just be say pulled over
 
03:54:29.149 --> 03:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
for a speeding ticket law enforcement
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
may now be required do a little walk
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
around the car you know check the tires
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
look for lights um so increased
 
03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:38.670 align:start position:0%
look for lights um so increased
enforcement

03:54:38.670 --> 03:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:54:41.950 --> 03:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
um getting back to some data uh you know
 
03:54:43.950 --> 03:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
the most recent study related to safety
 
03:54:46.349 --> 03:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
inspection from 2023 was done by the
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
Journal of transportation engineering um
 
03:54:51.070 --> 03:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
and it found that states uh with safety
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
inspections have 5.5% fewer annual
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
fatalities than those without so um
 
03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
those states are in fact safer um it
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
looked at 50 states over a 44 uh year
 
03:55:06.750 --> 03:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
period so pretty exhaustive
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
um we have an annual safety inspection
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
program and we still have and it's in my
 
03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
handout so I'll give it to you even with
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
an annual safety inspection program we
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
still have a 14% vehicle failure rate
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
which means those shop those car
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles roll into the shop uh with a
 
03:55:22.590 --> 03:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
14% failure rate if you get rid of the
 
03:55:25.229 --> 03:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
program uh I can't imagine how that
 
03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
number would escalate so we anticipate a
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
whole lot more of unsafe vehicles on the
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
road that can lead to accidents injuries
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
um U Mr just to get back to what Mr
 
03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald said I'll conclude after that
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
you know emissions reductions according
 
03:55:46.389 --> 03:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
to the EP a are are a piece of a pie
 
03:55:48.630 --> 03:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
right we've all given our pound of Flesh
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay so if cars get a free pass and no
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
longer have to be emissions tested the
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
reductions have to come from somewhere
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
and what we had to ask is who's going to
 
03:55:58.990 --> 03:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
make up that piece of the pie is it the
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
Mills the power plants the
 
03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
truckers somebody's going to have to
 
03:56:05.189 --> 03:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
make up for those emissions reductions
 
03:56:08.070 --> 03:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
to to keep those numbers down so um
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's an end impact that could then
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
happen and then just importantly you all
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill in front of you
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure and if you look at the f note
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
it starts at a million doll hit to the
 
03:56:19.469 --> 03:56:19.479 align:start position:0%
state and then in 27 and 28 it's a $3
 
03:56:21.630 --> 03:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
million every year hit to the state uh
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
and look to the revenue so um we'd ask
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
you to carefully scrutinize the fiscal
 
03:56:27.550 --> 03:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
note as well so um with that being said
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for bouncing around um
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
but I know there are a lot of folks here
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
I'll give the my hand out to the clerk
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you all get a chance to
 
03:56:36.110 --> 03:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
read it because uh there's some some
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
great content data and facts included in
 
03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:39.710 align:start position:0%
great content data and facts included in
that

03:56:39.710 --> 03:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
sheet thank you question from the

thank you Mr chair thank you you
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned U how many thousands of recall
 
03:56:52.349 --> 03:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
stickers or not stickers but notices are
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
given out 34,000 I think this year or
 
03:56:56.830 --> 03:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
something like that do you have the uh
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
numbers of how many people never
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
responded to those in the state too no
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
sir I don't sorry repres St Clair that's
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
not a data point that we would
 
03:57:10.790 --> 03:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
track okay thank you for the questions
 
03:57:12.149 --> 03:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank

motorcyclist and on behalf of nimro uh
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
we are opposing uh HB 649 um her
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
testimony was the same that was given
 
03:58:04.990 --> 03:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
approximately two weeks ago so I'm going
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
to skip over a lot of these uh but I do
 
03:58:10.269 --> 03:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
want to highlight um uh specifically for
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
motorcycles uh Provisions for motorcycle
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
exhaust system sound testing during
 
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
during annual inspections would be
 
03:58:18.030 --> 03:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated if this bill becomes law many
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
years ago nimro worked with state
 
03:58:21.550 --> 03:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and other organizations to
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
bring objective sound testing to New
 
03:58:25.349 --> 03:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to address complaints of
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
excessively loud motorcycles we believe
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Society of Automotive Engineers Saj
 
03:58:33.870 --> 03:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
2825 measurement of exhaust sound
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
pressure levels of stationary onh
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
Highway motorcycles is an effective
 
03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
procedure that provides owners
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
inspection stations and law enforcement
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
with a clear measurement of New
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registered on Highway
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
Motorcycle sound levels um so again a
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
lot of what um Dan benett just said um
 
03:58:54.389 --> 03:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
eliminating uh the state inspection um
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
increases law enforcement um
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
observations and pulling over
 
03:59:01.389 --> 03:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
motorcycles and testing them on the side
 
03:59:04.349 --> 03:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
of the road um if it's warranted because
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
it it sounds exceptionally loud that's
 
03:59:08.429 --> 03:59:08.439 align:start position:0%
great but at the same time it's a safety
 
03:59:10.269 --> 03:59:10.279 align:start position:0%
issue every time law enforcement pulls
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
somebody over it's a safety issue U for
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
for the the motorist the motorcyclist
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
and the the state polies um again thank
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
you for your time and again we oppose HB
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
649 thank you very much questions from
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
the committee representative gon thank
 
03:59:29.550 --> 03:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so am I interpreting your
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly is it your testimony
 
03:59:33.630 --> 03:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
that passing this would cause uh law
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement to profile motorcycles that
 
03:59:39.790 --> 03:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
could be allowed for the sake of that um
 
03:59:42.149 --> 03:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
I know there obviously nimro has
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
testified and I believe uh um there is
 
03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
not a motorcyc well there is a
 
03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
motorcycle profiling Bill U that was uh
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
I think passed uh last year or the year
 
03:59:55.229 --> 03:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
before um again is a common occurrence U
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
still uh anytime you you give anybody uh
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
a chance to uh pull over motorcyclist um
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement may take it um
 
04:00:05.120 --> 04:00:06.149 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement may take it um
if

04:00:06.149 --> 04:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
a inspection uh requirement is not part
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
of or we do away with the inspection
 
04:00:15.189 --> 04:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
requirement um that LE I think that
 
04:00:17.469 --> 04:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
leaves the door open for more law
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement involvement with the sound
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
motorcycles further questions see n
 
04:00:27.149 --> 04:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I do have
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
testimon sir okay great if you can pass
 
04:00:52.110 --> 04:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:54.229 --> 04:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
all right next up chair recognizes Jason
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
Hennessy uh in support of the bill
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
representing himself looking for three
 
04:00:59.309 --> 04:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
minutes and I'm going to start holding
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
all yours all right thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
honorable members of house
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation my name is Jason Hennessy
 
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of am New Hampshire and I
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
also hold a PhD in computational
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
sciences and
 
04:01:49.990 --> 04:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
statistics and I'm here to talk to you
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
about four points today uh first one is
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
that the the data shows that inspections
 
04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
do not actually improve the safety of
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
either fatalities or crashes according
 
04:02:02.309 --> 04:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
to multiple studies uh second most other
 
04:02:04.590 --> 04:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
states have eliminated their in annual
 
04:02:07.710 --> 04:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
inspections third that we can realize
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
some significant cost savings from
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
eliminating inspections and fourth that
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
safety inspections dis proportionately
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
affect the poor so first uh the question
 
04:02:21.790 --> 04:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
is do inspections actually improve
 
04:02:25.550 --> 04:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
safety and from all of the uh studies
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
that I've been able to look out look at
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
the best ones and the the most
 
04:02:30.990 --> 04:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive ones the answer is
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
universally no they do not um I'll draw
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
your attention to two two major studies
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is a 2015 study by the
 
04:02:41.309 --> 04:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
US federal government accountability
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
office who did a literature review and a
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
study a new study themselves uh for the
 
04:02:50.149 --> 04:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
Senate US Senate and what they concluded
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
was that studies GAO reviewed and Go's
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
analysis of State data examined the
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
effect of inspection programs on Crash
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
rates related to vehicle component
 
04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
failure but showed no clear influence a
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
2018 study uh that does a differences
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
and differences study on New Jersey
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
which is actually kind of the one of the
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
gold standards you can get for policy
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
changes show that New Jersey had no
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
increase in fatalities or CR
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
es and uh and and why why is that well
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the if you look at the
 
04:03:23.830 --> 04:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
fatality rate even just from a hundred
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
years ago when we started having
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
inspections it was 20 it was about 24
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
fatalities per 100 million miles
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
driven uh and that was 1921 by 1970 it
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
was down to
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
4.7 and in 2022 it's down to 1.3 so cars
 
04:03:42.910 --> 04:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
are getting safer we don't have as many
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
equipment related failures and from the
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that I can find only about 2%
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
of actual fatalities or even crashes are
 
04:03:54.149 --> 04:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
a vehicle equipment related so you're
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
taking a small percentage of a shrinking
 
04:04:02.110 --> 04:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
number and and that is why um it none of
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
the studies that I've been able to find
 
04:04:06.389 --> 04:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
H actually can show any correlation
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
between fatalities and uh car
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
inspections second most states have
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
realized this
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
we are in a tiny minority um now I've
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
heard some people say oh well we have
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
very unique conditions because we salt
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
the roads uh so I got my PhD in South
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
Dakota and let me tell you their weather
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
is more intense than ours you know
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're encouraged to actually
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
pack a box uh in your car in case you
 
04:04:34.429 --> 04:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
get stranded for two days because
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes the snow is so bad they can't
 
04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
get out to you to pull you out of the
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
ditch so um so States like Alaska
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Iowa Montana Minnesota in
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
Michigan North and South Dakota and
 
04:04:48.269 --> 04:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
Wyoming all have no inspections and you
 
04:04:49.870 --> 04:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
would think that if that's a problem
 
04:04:52.030 --> 04:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
they would have implemented
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
it uh 30 so as of the 70s in at in the
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
peak in the 70s 31 States required
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
annual inspections now only 11 do
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
so I encourage you to think about well
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
if they it's only gone in One Direction
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
why haven't they gone back if they if
 
04:05:10.349 --> 04:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
they had all these issues and remember
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
again we are not the only cold state
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
that that has inspections or doesn't
 
04:05:14.080 --> 04:05:15.189 align:start position:0%
that that has inspections or doesn't
have

04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:05:19.149 --> 04:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
inspections uh third we can realize some
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings for our
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
population and potentially the state by
 
04:05:24.199 --> 04:05:26.030 align:start position:0%
population and potentially the state by
eliminating

04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
04:05:28.750 --> 04:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
inspections so I I did a calculation
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
here that estimates New Hampshire
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
residents could save about $80 million a
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
year now this is counting both their
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
time um so you know if you assume the
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
average person goes for an hour and the
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
average wage is about 33 bucks an hour
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
and there's the fiscal note say had
 
04:05:46.110 --> 04:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
about a million inspections a year that
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
works out to about uh 35 million bucks
 
04:05:53.229 --> 04:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
and then the average cost of an
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
inspection from what I could find was
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
about $44 meaning that $46 million is
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
spent by New Hampshire residents every
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
year so this is an easy elimination of
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
costs to our to our con citizens our
 
04:06:08.279 --> 04:06:10.670 align:start position:0%
costs to our to our con citizens our
constituencies

04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
constituencies
 
04:06:14.110 --> 04:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
finally uh the state
 
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure now I don't have an estimate
 
04:06:17.149 --> 04:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
for this but the state has to spend
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
money to handle the 1 million
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
inspections per year there's probably
 
04:06:22.149 --> 04:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
tech support there's probably people
 
04:06:24.189 --> 04:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
that get called there's databases and
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
things like that if we get rid of these
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
those are things that we don't have to
 
04:06:27.199 --> 04:06:28.670 align:start position:0%
those are things that we don't have to
do

04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
anymore and then my last Point
 
04:06:33.149 --> 04:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
eliminating uh unnecessary inspections
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
can improve the cost of living the
 
04:06:37.229 --> 04:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
number one issue that I see I've seen
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire in many studies is is
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
the housing is cost of living here it's
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's very high compared to our neighbor
 
04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the country this is an
 
04:06:48.750 --> 04:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
easy way for us to improve
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
that um well High income earners you
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
know don't bear the brunt of the
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
inconvenience they can take time off of
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
work they you know the the money is not
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
going to for repairs or whatever is not
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
going to affect them as much people on
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
the other end of the economic spectrum
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't have that luxury they have to take
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
time off of work um they have they'll
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
they'll have to put higher repair bills
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
and having a car having a car and new
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a
 
04:07:17.229 --> 04:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
necessity so if if we want to make it
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
more affordable here in New Hampshire we
 
04:07:21.870 --> 04:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
need to get rid of
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
this um and you I'm sure there are many
 
04:07:26.349 --> 04:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
anecdotes of cars that have been found
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
to have major problems but the fact is
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier that cars are
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
safer than they were even like over
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
three times safer than even 50 years ago
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
and most people won't drive a car that
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
has major safety
 
04:07:43.109 --> 04:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
issues elimating safety inspections
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
returns responsibility back to the
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
driver to ensure that they have a safe
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
car the same is done in the vast
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
majority of States including liberal
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
ones like California Minnesota as well
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
conservative ones like Texas and
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
Florida and with that I'd be happy to
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
take any
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir questions from
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
the committee represent
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
P um New Hampshire currently doesn't
 
04:08:10.990 --> 04:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
allow auto insurance we don't mandate it
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the states that don't have
 
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
inspections is there any correlation to
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
those States requiring auto insurance
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:08:22.990 --> 04:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative I don't have that data
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
off hand so I can't dance
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
that further
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.149 --> 04:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
I did my best and even get a second
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
opinion uh next shair recognizes I'm
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
going to say Sheriff because I can't
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
read the name from Brentwood New
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who's opposed to the bill
 
04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
ah if you can say that one more time for
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk please when you when you're
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
there you go I've come before this
 
04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
committee today I can just get you state
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
your name again sorry my name is uh
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
Chuck mes M SS a o I'm the sheriff of
 
04:09:28.349 --> 04:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
Rocky M County but I'm also a business
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
owner owner auto repair facility in
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
londondary New Hampshire called
 
04:09:35.950 --> 04:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
londondary BP uh I came today and two
 
04:09:37.870 --> 04:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
different versions but after listen to
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
some of this testimony uh when it comes
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement we hold our vehicles
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
to a higher safety protocol because of
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
all the traffic stops and all the work
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
that we do to those guys uh safety uh
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
safety inspection program is is an
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
essential in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple reasons why now I
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
listened to someone say that New Jersey
 
04:10:04.510 --> 04:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have uh inspection program well
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
couple months ago my son and my
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law live in New
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
Jersey and my daughter-in-law with the
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
two babies in the back seat had a blow
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
up because all her tires were bald and
 
04:10:17.309 --> 04:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
they live 4 and a half hours away for
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
from you so dad can't inspect that
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle so to say
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
that the program is not worth having is
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely wrong I mean I feel in my
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
opinion for doing inspections for over
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
40 years I think the average rate of an
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
inspection is $45 compared to my
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
$150 labor rate and if you do an
 
04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
inspection correctly you're looking
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
about an hour to inspect a car to do it
 
04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
to do it correctly um the average person
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
has no idea if their tie is a bald their
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
brake lines are leaking brake fluid that
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
could cause that accident um I had a car
 
04:11:00.670 --> 04:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
come in two weeks ago and luckily it
 
04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
didn't hit anybody because his baldr let
 
04:11:04.750 --> 04:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
go and he landed up in the middle of the
 
04:11:07.710 --> 04:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
road so I think the state has a great
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
program when it comes to uh the
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
inspection um it's safety of everyone
 
04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
that lives in the state and from out of
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
state um our environmental our
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
environmental our environment is
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
different because of all the salt that's
 
04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
on the road the cold the hot weather
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's a real effect on vehicles um in
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion uh the emissions
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
program is a great program because not
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
only does it help our um environment but
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
when we do an inspection and the
 
04:11:42.030 --> 04:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
emission report comes out there's a lot
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
of safety recalls that we hand to the
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
customer and say Hey listen you need to
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
get a hold of the dealer uh it's going
 
04:11:50.469 --> 04:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
to save you money and and it's going to
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
be right for the vehicle but I'm going
 
04:11:53.109 --> 04:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
to end it because I know I only got
 
04:11:55.950 --> 04:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
three minutes um I oppose this bill I
 
04:11:58.590 --> 04:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
think it would be a big mistake for New
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to drop the safety the safety
 
04:12:05.070 --> 04:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire safety program and I
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
hope that you know after listening to
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
all the testimony today I hope that you
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
all agree with the people that are in
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
this room that it's not right to get rid
 
04:12:15.030 --> 04:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
of this program thank you very much
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I take any questions if
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
there are any are there any questions
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
you uh next CH recognizes looks like
 
04:12:27.399 --> 04:12:28.269 align:start position:0%
you uh next CH recognizes looks like

04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon to the members of
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for your time uh
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Jeffrey kelman I live in
 
04:12:45.109 --> 04:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire uh so I just
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to and I only have a couple
 
04:12:48.070 --> 04:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll keep this in pretty short
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
because it looks like there's a lot of
 
04:12:50.910 --> 04:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
people speaking on this today uh I just
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that in my own
 
04:12:55.389 --> 04:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
personal experience I've seen a uh a lot
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
of a highly subjective enforcement of uh
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
seemingly trivial thing sometimes uh so
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
I happen to be fairly OCD taking care of
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
my car uh in you know every possible
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
sense I changed out windshield wipers at
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
one time a mere days before going to
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
have an inspection knowing that was one
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
of many of the uh items on the list to
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh inspect if it could be streaking or
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
if there's any of these other aspects
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is something that could fail you so
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh anticipating this changed it out and
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
took it to an inspection spot uh and
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
they decided to say that your windshield
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
wipers are streaking well uh these were
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
brand new you know Bosch top of the line
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
you know just installed uh there's no
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
way that that could be streaking um but
 
04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
this goes back to uh one the sub
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
subjective nature and then also the doe
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
due process component you know I say
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
they're not streaking if the individual
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
says they are I can say all right well
 
04:13:55.950 --> 04:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
let's look at them all right so he
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
starts moving them I say you know I've
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
got 2020 Vision I'm looking at this
 
04:14:01.149 --> 04:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
right here uh you know there's there's
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
no streaking but nevertheless they they
 
04:14:05.429 --> 04:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
say there is and and there you can get a
 
04:14:08.309 --> 04:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
fail off of measures as simple as this
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh this is obviously very you know small
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
anecdote but you know taking that across
 
04:14:14.109 --> 04:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of people across
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
the state uh and and even on something
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
as simple as that we've heard from
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
another individual that uh the the the
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
cost could amount to the you know tens
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
of millions uh both in terms of time and
 
04:14:27.590 --> 04:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the actual physical cost so uh I I
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to imagine that that's something if
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
we could avoid that would be uh
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the residents of New
 
04:14:33.520 --> 04:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the residents of New
Hampshire

04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:14:37.710 --> 04:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't think I mentioned
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly I am supporting them the bill
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
as a as a result of that thank you thank
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
much and I would take questions if there
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
were any any questions from the
 
04:14:54.990 --> 04:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:03.189 --> 04:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
right next up chair recognizes
 
04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative sellers did he leave
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
again nope there he is the hiding in the
 
04:15:19.950 --> 04:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.790 --> 04:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee repres
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
representative W chairman Walsh thank
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
you for the time I'm representative John
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
cers Bristol Bridgewater graft and 10 I
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh of course I'm supporting this bill um
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
I just had my inspection today well
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh last week but I had to go
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
back in for
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
repairs over $1,000 doll for something I
 
04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
could have actually done if the weather
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
was warmer I don't have an indoor garage
 
04:15:48.189 --> 04:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
but it was all mechanical I could have I
 
04:15:49.389 --> 04:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
could have easily done if the weather
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
was warmer but it wasn't so I had to
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
actually go ahead and pay the man and
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
pay the bill you know thankfully I have
 
04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
the money but there are a lot of people
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
out there that don't and that's what
 
04:16:02.429 --> 04:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
this bill hits as well it does really
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
hit the poor in the elderly a lot of us
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
elderly people only have the Social
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
Security or maybe a pension that's it so
 
04:16:12.670 --> 04:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
and they have to go go in and for that
 
04:16:15.269 --> 04:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
stick once a year and you you are kind
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
of at the mercy it's not like you're
 
04:16:19.229 --> 04:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
standing by the mechanic as they're
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
inspecting the vehicle it's in the
 
04:16:22.510 --> 04:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
garage you're in the waiting room they
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
come back in so oh you need this or that
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
and they might show you they might not
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
show you but you're at the mercy of what
 
04:16:30.510 --> 04:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're saying I mean even for a simple
 
04:16:30.520 --> 04:16:31.429 align:start position:0%
they're saying I mean even for a simple
wiper

04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
wiper
 
04:16:34.510 --> 04:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
blade I've seen them go 2030 $40 just
 
04:16:36.670 --> 04:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
for a single blade I mean it's quite a
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
bit of
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
money um so as I brought up about the
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
cost for the poor and the Elder it
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
really is an issue if you really want to
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
help them out this program has to go and
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
again I heard also as well it will be a
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
savings a cost savings to the
 
04:16:53.950 --> 04:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
state I look at uh inspections and I
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
might have said it last year when I was
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
on this committee that um it's only a
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
moment in
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
time it's good for that one moment as
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
soon as I drive out that door something
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
could happen and if I'm that poor or
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
something I might not fix it for another
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
six seven months you know but something
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
truly could Happ happen as soon as I
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
walk out that door or drive out that
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
door with the vehicle so it is one
 
04:17:19.469 --> 04:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
snapshot in
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
time couple other things that we talked
 
04:17:23.790 --> 04:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
about on this committee before is you
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
know so much pitting on brakes 50% it's
 
04:17:28.590 --> 04:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
subjective are you going to count how
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
many pits around the brake and say oh
 
04:17:32.910 --> 04:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
that the brake is already half used how
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
about the rust you're saying okay it can
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
only have so much rust or so many you
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
know so partt of an inch or this or that
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it's like it's somewhat sued so you
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
know that's the problem with the
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
inspections everything is not you know
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
precise it's it's what the mechanic says
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it is uh gone past that
 
04:17:53.680 --> 04:17:57.910 align:start position:0%
yeah it is uh gone past that
point

04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I suppose I want to
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
say is New Hampshire we're very unique
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
in New England and we could really be a
 
04:18:09.109 --> 04:18:09.119 align:start position:0%
beacon until New England I mean showing
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
people that we are different and that
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is time that we have to change it's
 
04:18:17.149 --> 04:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's we just have to do it and not only
 
04:18:19.950 --> 04:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
that this is last thing is this is a
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
mandate you're mandating the people you
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
have to get an inspection this is not
 
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
Liberty or Freedom this is a mandate so
 
04:18:31.870 --> 04:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions if I can answer
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
any any questions from I knew child
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative s
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you just had your
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspected cost $1,000 you could
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
have done this in the warm weather
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
yourself this begs the question would
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
your vehicle have been safe to continue
 
04:19:00.429 --> 04:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
to the warm weather uh had you not had
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
to do this now yeah thanks for the
 
04:19:06.030 --> 04:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
question and I say yes because I they
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
actually did show me I need part of my
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
frame had to be welded it had probably
 
04:19:12.990 --> 04:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
three or four quarter size holes in them
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
so it needed to be welded so they put on
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
a piece of Steel all right I can do that
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
ball joints I only drove my vehicle
 
04:19:22.109 --> 04:19:22.119 align:start position:0%
about 10,000 miles so probably about
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
3,000 were coming here to the state
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
house but my point is I only drove
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
10,000 miles so from last year when I
 
04:19:30.750 --> 04:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
had it inspected so to wait a few more
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
months for ball joints I probably could
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
have easily done
 
04:19:37.870 --> 04:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the questions seeing
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much thank you for
 
04:19:41.469 --> 04:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
good to see you by the way yeah we do
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
miss you
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes oh you're going to you're
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to hate me uh in support of the
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill Derek verbage how do I
 
04:19:59.070 --> 04:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
do well come on up and tell me how we
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
did yeah it's uh I'd prefer to pronounce
 
04:20:02.720 --> 04:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
did yeah it's uh I'd prefer to pronounce
it

04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
veruki so um my name is Derek Fugi um I
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh came to speak and uh support of this
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill I'm a commercial delivery driver
 
04:20:17.550 --> 04:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
and I spend a lot of time dealing with
 
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles and um uh making sure that
 
04:20:22.830 --> 04:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're safe to drive it's part of my
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
job um one of the excuses I've had uh
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
issues with in my work is employers will
 
04:20:31.229 --> 04:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
claim that since a vehicle has safely
 
04:20:31.239 --> 04:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
claim that since a vehicle has safely
passed

04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
inspection uh it would be an issue for
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
me to ground it according to Department
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
of Transportation policy for not having
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
working parking brakes but uh I I can't
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
can't imagine I haven't really been able
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
to find private inspectors that could uh
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
possibly do the same
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
thing so I I just wonder how uh I've had
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience with very subjective
 
04:20:58.030 --> 04:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh inspection uh policies and I don't
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
understand uh why um people uh who don't
 
04:21:04.510 --> 04:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of money private individuals
 
04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to get their vehicles inspected to
 
04:21:12.670 --> 04:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.950 --> 04:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that any
 
04:21:16.349 --> 04:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee see none
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.349 --> 04:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
you uh next up chair recognizes Mary
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
Smith representing herself in support of
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.510 --> 04:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
minutes you'll tell me if I'm wrong in a
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
minute no you're just right uh Mr chair
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair members of the committee
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
my name is Mary Smith I'm a resident of
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I'm here to
 
04:21:44.590 --> 04:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
talk in support of this bill this isn't
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
the first time I've talked in support of
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
this bill or its various
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
iterations in the past by enums this
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill keeps coming up because people keep
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
wanting it and I keep wanting it and so
 
04:21:58.990 --> 04:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
in order to keep my testimony novel some
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
of the things that I want to bring to
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
you is that driving is the most
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous activity we engage in on a
 
04:22:09.070 --> 04:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
daily basis for most of us it's going to
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
be the most dangerous thing we do and we
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
live in a state where the motto is Live
 
04:22:18.109 --> 04:22:18.119 align:start position:0%
Free or Die I don't think that the level
 
04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
of intrusion into people's lives that
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
you've already heard about in the
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
testimony today is emblematic of that
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
motto Live Free or Die and another thing
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to note given my in uh my
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
experience of testifying for this bill
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
and similar bills over the pums is that
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
so far not always but almost everyone
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
you've heard in opposition to this bill
 
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
so far has had a direct financial
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
interest relating to the bill where they
 
04:22:50.189 --> 04:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
are directly
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
profiting by this system's continued
 
04:22:56.429 --> 04:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
existence I mean I have my own personal
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
experience of having a wheel bearing
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
that I replaced myself after it was
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
reason it was caused to deny inspection
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
I looked at the wheel bearing I took it
 
04:23:07.750 --> 04:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
apart it was perfectly good there was no
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
pitting it was it was beautiful but I
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
had to go through all of the effort
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
myself because where I got the
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
inspection they wanted to do the work
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
for something that wasn't an issue and
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
wow I they the amount they asked um for
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
me to pay them to do the work for
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't an issue was
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
incredible so I said no I'll handle it
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
myself um another thing I wanted to
 
04:23:35.469 --> 04:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
mention is that you know this also
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
usually comes up about the now maybe 225
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
million that could be withheld
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay that's a big threat that uh we
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
didn't really get more detail about okay
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
we weren't told and as far as I don't
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
know how is this handled with all of the
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
other states the 35 or 39 depending on
 
04:24:00.750 --> 04:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about emissions or in
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
other inspections or exactly how they
 
04:24:08.229 --> 04:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
handle it that don't um comply with this
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
sort of onerous regulation that we have
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
on uh individual in New Hampshire are do
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
those States is all that money withheld
 
04:24:20.109 --> 04:24:20.119 align:start position:0%
for them like if they have sips that
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
then turn into uh Federal uh Improvement
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
plans because of possible hypothetical
 
04:24:29.630 --> 04:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuits brought by uh citizens um what
 
04:24:31.149 --> 04:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
happens in those states do they lose
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
that money we didn't get an answer
 
04:24:36.030 --> 04:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
nobody told us answers on
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the last thing that I want to
 
04:24:43.830 --> 04:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
mention uh was that heard New Hampshire
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't require auto insurance that's
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
actually not true it doesn't require
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
auto insurance unless you uh have been
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
in an auto accident there are cases
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
where you will be required by law and
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
you can look at the statute yourself to
 
04:25:03.710 --> 04:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
have insurance for a certain amount of
 
04:25:06.030 --> 04:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
time I forgot what the forms called you
 
04:25:09.790 --> 04:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
can look it up on the DMV website
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah uh
 
04:25:15.630 --> 04:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll just end
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
on on that I've heard you know the
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
failure rate that we heard today was 14%
 
04:25:24.269 --> 04:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
you know 14% you'd expect blood in the
 
04:25:26.149 --> 04:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
streets I've heard higher I've heard
 
04:25:28.750 --> 04:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
around 20% in the past and we didn't
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
have blood in the street then either so
 
04:25:33.550 --> 04:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's this is
 
04:25:36.109 --> 04:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
ridiculous thank you very much any
 
04:25:39.189 --> 04:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions from anybody on the
 
04:25:39.199 --> 04:25:41.070 align:start position:0%
questions from anybody on the
committee

04:25:41.070 --> 04:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
repres thank thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
you um you mentioned your Baron so your
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
inspection was not given be you didn't
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
get the sticker because of the bad
 
04:25:53.349 --> 04:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
bearing you fixed the bearing did you
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
bring it back to the same station to get
 
04:25:55.800 --> 04:25:57.429 align:start position:0%
bring it back to the same station to get
your

04:25:57.429 --> 04:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
sticker no I didn't what I did was an
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
option that is unavailable to most of
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
the low-income residents of New
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is I got my vehicle
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
transferred ownership to a trust in
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
Montana where they don't require
 
04:26:14.590 --> 04:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
inspections so this is not going to be
 
04:26:17.229 --> 04:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
an option for the lowincome residents of
 
04:26:20.189 --> 04:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire okay thank
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
you I've never seen this before let's
 
04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
see if it's true next up chair
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes James Parker in support of
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay I will be brief uh I own multiple
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles that I would register if I
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
weren't afraid of uh them failing
 
04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
inspection and these are occasional use
 
04:27:01.550 --> 04:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
Vehicles two of them are work trucks uh
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
that are of limited use on a private
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
property and one of them is a family
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
heirloom so that's
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes Steve zck uh
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
himself all right I'll try to keep this
 
04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
quick uh this is it I can if you get me
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
going on this I can start ranting for
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
hours so I'll try to keep it quick and I
 
04:27:38.590 --> 04:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
can stop you too all
 
04:27:40.910 --> 04:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
right uh my name is Steve manic I live
 
04:27:44.910 --> 04:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
in West Manchester in w 11 and
 
04:27:48.269 --> 04:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
um basically I think that the entire New
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire inspection sticker is nothing
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
but a complete scam at this
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
point uh and I say that as somebody who
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
works on their own vehicles uh I'm a
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
automotive hobbyist at one point I
 
04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
worked at an auto dealership um I fix uh
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
cars for friends and family on the side
 
04:28:08.670 --> 04:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
um and I've done everything from
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
rebuilding a transmission to uh or
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
rebuilding an engine and major
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
suspension work uh welding you name it
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
I've probably done it um it's you know
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
but it's a side hobby for me um and uh
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
there's a few problems with the uh
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
inspection uh the inspection system in
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and a lot of it is the
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
rules are very are often vague or
 
04:28:39.550 --> 04:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
they're subject to
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation um and
 
04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes the uh shops get creative with
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
their uh interpretation there's no
 
04:28:52.469 --> 04:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
consistency between inspection stations
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
um one of the frequent questions you'll
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
see asked online is hey where should I
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
go get my inspection sticker done um and
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
people start answering and the truth of
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
the matter is
 
04:29:09.710 --> 04:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
if the system was actually Fair it
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter but there's no
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
consistency and not only is there not
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
consistency uh between stations but
 
04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
there's not even consistency between the
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
same mechanic or the different mechanics
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
within the same station um when I worked
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
for a car dealership the service
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
director said oh when you bring your car
 
04:29:29.030 --> 04:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
and have you know Bob look at it he's a
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
lot more lenient than the rest of them
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
um but the rules are the the rules
 
04:29:37.710 --> 04:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
should be the rules and not subject to
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
sub uh subjective interpretation uh and
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
as people have already brought up
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's no appeal
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
process um the other thing is uh I think
 
04:29:49.149 --> 04:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's time to just get rid of the program
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
alog together because New Hampshire's
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
legislative attempts at correcting or
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
fixing this program have basically
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
failed uh in 2018 the governor signed
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
1517 uh which would uh basically codify
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh the rules on Rust and it's in the
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
rsas now and um I see people get jammed
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
up on Rust problems that would not
 
04:30:19.630 --> 04:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
violate that law um but because of
 
04:30:19.640 --> 04:30:20.710 align:start position:0%
violate that law um but because of
subjective

04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation um that they get jammed
 
04:30:28.830 --> 04:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
up uh and one side note to back up uh
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative sellers um the whole
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
expires on your birthday thing is really
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
annoying if you uh were born in the
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
winter and you do need to make your own
 
04:30:42.670 --> 04:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
repairs I yeah and you know if if it was
 
04:30:44.910 --> 04:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
good for a whole year and you could do
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
it when it was warm out I think more
 
04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
people would be okay with it
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
um uh and one thing that was brought up
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
is that um New Hampshire's inspection
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
sticker system is a uh free market
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
solution and I disagree because if this
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
was truly a free market solution to a
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
problem in the states that don't require
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
annual inspection the insurance
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
companies sure would mandate it but the
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies don't require people
 
04:31:16.670 --> 04:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
in states without um uh inspection to
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
get get a inspection
 
04:31:21.950 --> 04:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
done um and also I think that the fiscal
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
note on this bill is incomplete and I
 
04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of missing Revenue
 
04:31:29.149 --> 04:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's unknown uh that would probably
 
04:31:31.630 --> 04:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire if uh this program
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
was abolished and a lot of it is people
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
are afraid to register their cars in uh
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of the uh
 
04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
inspection regulations so people
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
register their cars and family names and
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
stuff uh out of state so they don't have
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with it um I grew up in the
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is I grew up in
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they have inspection
 
04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
stickers too and I never had a problem
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
down there um when if you uh needed an
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker there's plenty of
 
04:32:03.189 --> 04:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
shops that they only do inspection
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
stickers on Saturday you just show up
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
you wait in line and they're they would
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
have you in and out in like 10 minutes
 
04:32:12.269 --> 04:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
I've gotten inspection stickers with
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
without uh even uh getting out of the
 
04:32:18.189 --> 04:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
car uh they come up like a NASCAR pck
 
04:32:19.870 --> 04:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
stop and they jack up the car check the
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
suspension real quick turn on your
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
lights Hunker horn do the OBD test all
 
04:32:27.109 --> 04:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
right you're good um and here you need
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
an appointment and they want you to drop
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
the whole car off for a whole day and uh
 
04:32:36.750 --> 04:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
you know it takes over an hour and uh it
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
it it's it's majorly inconvenient when
 
04:32:40.269 --> 04:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
you don't have a problem with the
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
inspections um and I've always driven
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
older cars so it's it's every year it's
 
04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
something that I'm not expecting them to
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
give you a hassle about and they you
 
04:32:53.870 --> 04:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
know and sometimes they do um but I uh
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
at one point I finally bought a new
 
04:32:59.309 --> 04:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle or at least it was certified
 
04:33:01.389 --> 04:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
pre-owned one-year-old vehicle and had
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of miles on it um and I
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
bought it from the company I was working
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
for and I was like all when when you
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
know a couple months later because it's
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
my birthday I got to go get my
 
04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker I'm like all right
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
cool finally I have a brand new car what
 
04:33:17.629 --> 04:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
could they possibly fail me on I'm
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
finally I don't have to deal with this
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
headache well surprise surprise I get a
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
phone call from the service adviser and
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
he goes Steve got a problem uh you're
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to need new front brakes uh
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
inspection and when I bought the car
 
04:33:32.349 --> 04:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
they told me it had new brakes all the
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
way around so I said well if I need uh I
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
was told I had new front BR new brakes
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
all the way around when I bought it I I
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
got to stop you for a second only
 
04:33:44.709 --> 04:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
because I remember the story okay so if
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
I remember the story from a bill a
 
04:33:48.670 --> 04:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago I think if you can
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
shorten it up and talk about sure but I
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
mean long story short uh I didn't need
 
04:33:55.869 --> 04:33:55.879 align:start position:0%
do breaks uh and I when I thought when I
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
pushed back they they you know they gave
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
me the sticker um and uh I just wonder
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
if they pulled that tried to pull that
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
stunt on me and they know I work on my
 
04:34:08.590 --> 04:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
own stuff uh what are they pulling your
 
04:34:10.230 --> 04:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
average Grandma when she comes in for an
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh and that's about
 
04:34:18.670 --> 04:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you sir thank you any questions
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank thanks very
 
04:34:24.269 --> 04:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
much your point
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
up I've actually got two representatives
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
from State Police are they independent
 
04:34:41.039 --> 04:34:46.789 align:start position:0%
from State Police are they independent
testimony

04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
um okay so they're completely separate
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
all right um uh next up chair recognizes
 
04:34:55.869 --> 04:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
uh Kyle huton the Hampshire State Police
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill looking for 10
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon I will keep it as
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
briefly as I can I'm Carl hon I'm with
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh State Police uh
 
04:35:06.400 --> 04:35:07.551 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh State Police uh
Troop

04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
Troop
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
G in opposition to The Spill a couple of
 
04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
things that have been brought up already
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh which I will um reinforce um the
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
average citizen uh average car owner
 
04:35:22.109 --> 04:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire doesn't have the
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
requisite knowledge to determine whether
 
04:35:26.349 --> 04:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
or not uh the vehicle is safe in most
 
04:35:28.349 --> 04:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
instances maybe not so much as looking
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
at the tires but Brak suspension exhaust
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
and things like that uh there is an
 
04:35:35.470 --> 04:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
appeal process uh through trip G if you
 
04:35:37.429 --> 04:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
have an issue with an inspection that
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
was done um we do get complaints from
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
time to time
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this is that
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
eliminating this particular U program
 
04:35:52.510 --> 04:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
would force law enforcement roadside to
 
04:35:54.070 --> 04:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
basically determine whether a vehicle
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
was safe for operation or
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
not most of law enforcement has not been
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
properly trained or certified to
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
determine that especially on a roadside
 
04:36:05.520 --> 04:36:07.109 align:start position:0%
determine that especially on a roadside
uh

04:36:07.109 --> 04:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:09.029 --> 04:36:09.039 align:start position:0%
inspection one of the other things that
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
has not been mentioned in here which I
 
04:36:13.869 --> 04:36:13.879 align:start position:0%
will bring up it's a more of a consumer
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
protection issue than anything else
 
04:36:18.029 --> 04:36:18.039 align:start position:0%
every time a vehicle is inspected the
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
mileage is tracked so if I've got a
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's got 200,000 miles on it
 
04:36:26.830 --> 04:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not honest I could roll the
 
04:36:28.910 --> 04:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
speedometer back 100,000 miles and try
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
to sell it as a vehicle with 100,000
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
miles on it the system that we have in
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
place now would actually catch that so
 
04:36:37.390 --> 04:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
if I got an inspected last year it had
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
220,000 mil on it I sell it it gets
 
04:36:43.109 --> 04:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
inspected again in the state and it only
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
has 120,000 Mi on it um there would be a
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
trigger that would notify us that hey
 
04:36:51.029 --> 04:36:51.039 align:start position:0%
there's a that tampering um with the
 
04:36:54.269 --> 04:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
odometer which is certainly a consumer
 
04:36:54.279 --> 04:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
odometer which is certainly a consumer
protection

04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:36:55.520 --> 04:36:59.590 align:start position:0%
protection
issue

04:36:59.590 --> 04:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
um what mechanism would they bear in
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
place if we found a vehicle that was
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
unsafe roadside
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
um everything else I think is has been
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
um said here
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
um and the the sheriff also talked about
 
04:37:17.869 --> 04:37:17.879 align:start position:0%
um the consumer not being um properly
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
trained um to recognize whether or not a
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle is is safe for operation thank
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
you and I'll answer any questions that I
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
can thank you sir question ribson of
 
04:37:31.629 --> 04:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
gon thank you uh Mr chair thank you
 
04:37:35.709 --> 04:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
Sergeant so you can now police police
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
officers and state troopers right now
 
04:37:39.269 --> 04:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
can pull somebody over for observing
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
while driving an unsafe act or an unsafe
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment is that correct sir
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
yes follow up follow so is it your
 
04:37:48.910 --> 04:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that you would have to train
 
04:37:50.910 --> 04:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
your police to go on fishing expeditions
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
to inspect vehicles on the side of the
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
road if there is not something that's
 
04:37:53.680 --> 04:37:54.789 align:start position:0%
road if there is not something that's
evidently

04:37:54.789 --> 04:37:54.799 align:start position:0%
evidently
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
unsafe no uh what I meant was that if
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
somebody stopped a vehicle for um speed
 
04:38:02.910 --> 04:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever if
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
they hold on one second where where did
 
04:38:07.390 --> 04:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
the fishing Expedition thing come from
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
pardon me chair uh Mr chair I'll
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
rephrase it would it then be your
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that police would have to
 
04:38:15.390 --> 04:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
inspect a vehicle more further than what
 
04:38:18.070 --> 04:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
they observed for a routine traffic stop
 
04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
on the site of a stop uh no um part of
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
that would be um if they for example sto
 
04:38:26.029 --> 04:38:26.039 align:start position:0%
a vehicle for speeding if they noticed
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
something that was unsafe they then
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
would have to take further action and
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
they would have to be trained on
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing whether or not something was
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
unsafe or
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
not does that make sense to you
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
sir yes sir I guess it doesn't make
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
sense because they do that now but thank
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions represent
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
pararo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so your excuse me
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
your major point today is uh the
 
04:38:55.709 --> 04:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
officers aren't trained on doing um
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
field inspections during stops are you
 
04:39:01.709 --> 04:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
indicating that there is out there some
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
sort of training program for the
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
officers in existence
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
or there certainly could be and I
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe uh the camp is going to speak to
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
that Point sorry was I
 
04:39:13.199 --> 04:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
that Point sorry was I
correct

04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
training I believe he's going to be
 
04:39:19.629 --> 04:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
speaking shortly if you want to hold
 
04:39:21.390 --> 04:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
that question very well thank you thank
 
04:39:23.551 --> 04:39:23.561 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you H I
 
04:39:26.670 --> 04:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
have another one go ahead thank you Mr
 
04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
chairman I think you for taking my
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
question um I live and work in New
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only if I were to register my
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
car out of state would that be lawful
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
and if not what would the penalty
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
be thank you for the question yes that
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
is not uh legal um there there was a
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that if you're a resident in
 
04:39:45.150 --> 04:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire uh you need to register
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
your vehicle here um depending on um I
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.470 --> 04:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from the
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
mood next up chair recogniz
 
04:40:08.830 --> 04:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
is Matt and moui are representing the
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police opposed to
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
the bill for a couple of minutes and I
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
believe a few questions
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is MD mitui I
 
04:40:22.030 --> 04:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire State Police
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition to this
 
04:40:28.030 --> 04:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh this bill would um have a great
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
impact on the division of State Police
 
04:40:31.390 --> 04:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
and all of law enforcement in New
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill would require
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
additional training that training would
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
have to start at the Academy it would
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
continue to field training uh and then
 
04:40:42.510 --> 04:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
additional inservice training
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh it would increase responsibility for
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
our Troopers and law enforcement who are
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
already stretched thin and being asked
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
to do more with less resources State
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
Police has primary Patrol
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in 68 towns and
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
unincorporated areas and secondary
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
Patrol responsibilities in another 75
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
towns in unincorporated areas that's
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
nearly 56% of the state and this
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
continues to grow as resources uh are
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
stretched inin and diminished amongst um
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement County Law
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
Enforcement and State
 
04:41:15.390 --> 04:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
Police um currently we have 62

vacancies um in 2024 the New Hampshire
 
04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
State Police had over 170,000 calls for
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
service and conducted over 999,000 motor

vehicle uh include 13 primary um areas
 
04:41:35.470 --> 04:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
some of these areas include um steering
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
and suspension brakes uh tires and
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
wheels um during the recent
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
storm that we had on um last Thursday
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
February 6th which was a very short
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
duration storm um small storm in
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
comparison to some of the other storms
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we have we had 50 motor vehicle
 
04:41:56.190 --> 04:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
crashes uh four with personal injury 47
 
04:41:57.868 --> 04:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles that were off the road and 20
 
04:41:57.878 --> 04:42:01.868 align:start position:0%
vehicles that were off the road and 20
disabled

04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles um inspections would need to be
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
conducted each time uh delaying
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
responses to other motor vehicle um
 
04:42:10.990 --> 04:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
motorists that are off the uh off the
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
road Road it would increase liability on
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
the state police and the state of New
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a whole law enforcement
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
relies on inspection stations to ensure
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
that every vehicle is safe on our
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
roadways laws are designed to protect
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
our general safety and removing the
 
04:42:28.110 --> 04:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
requirement for safety inspection um
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
physical safety inspection would do the
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
opposite of that so that I'd open up to
 
04:42:32.320 --> 04:42:33.230 align:start position:0%
opposite of that so that I'd open up to
any

04:42:33.230 --> 04:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:42:36.150 --> 04:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir questions repr
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
Tower did you have a question uh in
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the training thank you Mr I
 
04:42:43.628 --> 04:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
actually do have a different question
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay I uh thank you Captain your
 
04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
testimony did cover my earlier question
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
um my new question is you just cited uh
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
statistics from accidents in the latest
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
storm how how did those statistics
 
04:42:57.788 --> 04:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
correlate to
 
04:43:00.150 --> 04:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
inspections so every time we would
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
encounter a motorist that goes off the
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
road involved in a an accident we
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know what the con the cause of
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
that crash is it could be ball tires it
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
could be um brakes that would would then
 
04:43:11.400 --> 04:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
could be um brakes that would would then
fall

04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
fall
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement to determine what are
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
the contributing factors of that and if
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
we were to just pull a vehicle out
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
that's off the road and let that vehicle
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
on its way and that vehicle were to get
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
into mode vehicle crash and a
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
contributing factor to that was faulty
 
04:43:30.430 --> 04:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
breaks that liability comes back on law
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the
 
04:43:36.310 --> 04:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
state yeah quick followup yeah go ahead
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
Ju Just so I understand the answer
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
um um
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
that you you bring you bring it up
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
because of a liability aspect and the
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
only reason I'm asking is because of
 
04:43:53.788 --> 04:43:53.798 align:start position:0%
like during an investigation of a
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
particular accident like wouldn't a
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
faulty break be revealed as the as the
 
04:44:03.070 --> 04:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
cause whether or not it the car passed
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
inspection it could okay what I'm saying
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
is um roadside we don't get into um that
 
04:44:11.670 --> 04:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
depth of
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
of Investigation I don't have the
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
training as
 
04:44:19.628 --> 04:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
to you know if the brakes aren't working
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
um if a vehicle goes off the road I'm
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
not checking the tread on
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
tires I'm seeing if the vehicle is
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
inspected and I'm going by by that
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes but if a vehicle goes off the
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
road during a snowstorm it may be
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
because the roads are slick it maybe
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
because the tires are bald it may be a
 
04:44:40.230 --> 04:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
combination of both I fear that if we
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
pull that vehicle out and let that
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle go on its way and that vehicle
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
gets in a crash down the road that
 
04:44:48.910 --> 04:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
results in a fatality and that a postc
 
04:44:50.910 --> 04:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
crash inspection is completed and a
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
contributing factor is ball tires that
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
liability will come back on the state
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
gotcha okay thank
 
04:45:01.030 --> 04:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
you any other questions repr
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
stclair thank you Mr chair thank you uh
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
Captain um do you often reach out to
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
other uh State Police and State that
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't have inspections to see if just to
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
hear their commentary on that you know
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
do they complain about it do they wish
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
they did or is it just something that's
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
not discussed very much between the
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
agencies it's not something that I've
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
had discussion with okay thank you for
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
questions represent thank you Mr
 
04:45:32.910 --> 04:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
question um it was there was testimony
 
04:45:38.910 --> 04:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
earlier that everybody up to that point
 
04:45:41.310 --> 04:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
who testified in support of the bill had
 
04:45:42.990 --> 04:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of an personal interest in
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill um I'm trying to
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
figure out what this personal interest
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
of the state police would be for
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
supporting this um what is your
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
incentive you
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
know I have sarcastic or you know we
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
have no interest um the reality is we
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
rely on other entities to to do their
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
jobs and this would be an added
 
04:46:06.910 --> 04:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility on your law enforcement
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um that is already
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
being asked to do a lot with limited
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
resources um I bring up the fact that
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
we're covering a lot of other towns our
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
increased calls and service
 
04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say we don't have
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
time to do roadside inspections but we
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't have time to do roadside
 
04:46:28.750 --> 04:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
inspections it's it's going to
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
increase in delay the time that we're on
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
um these motor vehicle
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
stops yeah go ahead thank you um when
 
04:46:42.030 --> 04:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
we've asked about statistics in the past
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
it was really difficult to
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
determine the whether an accident was
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
caused by some some kind of a mechanical
 
04:46:50.670 --> 04:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
failure that would have otherwise been
 
04:46:52.990 --> 04:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
caught in an inspection uh do we have
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
any information on that that we could I
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
don't have any stati statistics on that
 
04:47:02.110 --> 04:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
um typically those are done with serious
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
bodily injury crashes and fatality
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
crashes where post inspections are done
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
um but roadside investigation um it it
 
04:47:12.030 --> 04:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't typically get into the safety of
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
the vehicle unless the vehicle is um
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
uninspected or there's something that's
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
obviously wrong with the vehicle that's
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
blatantly obvious to the to the
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
investigating officer thank you
 
04:47:26.070 --> 04:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative SES thank you Mr chairman
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
actually that was my question I want it
 
04:47:30.670 --> 04:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
to be clear if I understand your
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
testimony then that at the present time
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we do not have an
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
effective system to track the the
 
04:47:41.200 --> 04:47:42.830 align:start position:0%
effective system to track the the
connection

04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
connection
 
04:47:45.868 --> 04:47:45.878 align:start position:0%
between vehicle inspection problems and
 
04:47:50.190 --> 04:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
crashes not all crashes not just fatal
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
ones not that I'm aware of I don't know
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the contributing factors I know but I
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
don't know everything as far as
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
mechanically what's wrong with with
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are involved in crashes
 
04:48:01.638 --> 04:48:02.750 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are involved in crashes
thank

04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
you representative hlin thank you Mr
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking that
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
questions uh so you've testimony is that
 
04:48:13.948 --> 04:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
without inspection this more work is
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to fall back on the your
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
department the state police do you have
 
04:48:22.230 --> 04:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
any estimation as to how much more
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel you would need to be able to
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
complete your duties or how much work
 
04:48:29.430 --> 04:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to require for
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
you I don't know how much more Personnel
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
um but it's hard getting Personnel in
 
04:48:36.548 --> 04:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
the door to begin with and it's hard to
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
retain the Personnel that we currently
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
have um
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities have
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
increased exponentially over the last
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
decade um and this would just be one
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
more thing that would be required of us
 
04:48:54.548 --> 04:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
starting at the Academy through field
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
training an additional inservice
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
training and and liability I mean if if
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
we are required to do this we're going
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
to do it the right way um which takes
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
time thank you yes
 
04:49:09.150 --> 04:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
sir forther
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions see thank you very much thank
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
you sir uh next
 
04:49:17.708 --> 04:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
up and I apologize in advance in support
 
04:49:21.548 --> 04:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
of the bill is it
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
Yakov why don't you come I can't do it
 
04:49:28.350 --> 04:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
welcome my name is yovav and I support
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
the bill um a few years ago when I lived
 
04:49:32.470 --> 04:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I first bought a
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and was uh need to register
 
04:49:37.708 --> 04:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
it I called all the shops in town and
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
around outside of town only one shop
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
would inspect motorcycles because the
 
04:49:44.830 --> 04:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
state changed the the the Mandate on
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
what shops had to do and uh pass and and
 
04:49:53.230 --> 04:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
shops just would not uh inspect anymore
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
uh one shop owner told me that on
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
principle he would no longer um inspect
 
04:50:01.708 --> 04:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
his motorcycle and neither does does do
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
his friends do um around where I live at
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
the moment there are less and less shops
 
04:50:08.910 --> 04:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
who actually inspect vehicles in the
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
first place uh for various reason either
 
04:50:13.230 --> 04:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
they fail or they just don't want to
 
04:50:14.670 --> 04:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
deal with it because they can make more
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
money uh fixing cars rather than
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
inspecting them um there are no new
 
04:50:23.548 --> 04:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
shops um inspecting them it's become
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
increasingly harder just to just to go
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
through the process um and a lot of
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
issues that come up are not really
 
04:50:34.150 --> 04:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
safety related but for for people it can
 
04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of money and I I know a
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people simply don't inspect their
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle because they're not going to
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
spend a a few thousand dollars on
 
04:50:46.350 --> 04:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
something that's that is mostly just a a
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
look and not rather an actual safety
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
issue um regarding a lot of shops
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
actually to what it was said that shops
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
um use the fact that people don't know
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
what the what the vehicles actually need
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
and they do it anyway say that they need
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
it my father took his vehicle uh that
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
was a few months old not a few months
 
04:51:08.190 --> 04:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
old after a few months that I got
 
04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
inspected to put snow tires on it and
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
the shop told him that he needed an
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
alignment uh what turned out to be is
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
that the shop basically tells everybody
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
they need an alignment because they find
 
04:51:22.830 --> 04:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
just every a a tiny fraction
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
deviation um to to use that as an excuse
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
to tell people that they actually need
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
to do an
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
alignment and that is
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%

bill um this uh position we oppose the
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh that opposition is in
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the New Hampshire
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Commissioner's
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
Office who uh also reviewed the bill and
 
04:52:04.548 --> 04:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
and um offered their thoughts on it as
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
well um I'm here today with uh Elizabeth
 
04:52:09.150 --> 04:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
mad who's the supervisor of our
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
registration Bureau which which um works
 
04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
with all the inspection stations
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so want to start
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
off by saying listening to the remarks
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
from Dan Bennett Sheriff msas captain
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
amuchi and Sergeant Huddleston I think
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
they rais many many great points um the
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
inspection program based on my view at
 
04:52:28.590 --> 04:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
the DMV Works uh it's a program that
 
04:52:30.270 --> 04:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
provides for an important layer of
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security for the motoring
 
04:52:33.868 --> 04:52:33.878 align:start position:0%
public uh we received very few
 
04:52:35.470 --> 04:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
complaints on the
 
04:52:38.548 --> 04:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
program um and when we do if we do
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
receive a complaint we act on it
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh we talk to the state police and they
 
04:52:45.548 --> 04:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
send out uh Lake Ken shap put behind me
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
to the left uh his automotive equipment
 
04:52:49.390 --> 04:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
inspectors will go out and do an
 
04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
inspection um and an audit or a trooper
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
will go out and do that um we've
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
actually since while the bill continues
 
04:52:58.750 --> 04:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
to come up these types of bills uh We've
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
added to the vehicle inspection report
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
so that there's a number there that a
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
customer if they don't feel like the
 
04:53:06.270 --> 04:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
inspection was done properly they can
 
04:53:08.910 --> 04:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
call they're referred to the DMB and um
 
04:53:09.990 --> 04:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then we communicate with the state
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
police to make sure that we follow
 
04:53:13.868 --> 04:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
through on that particular station uh to
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we do have uniformity and that
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh inspections are being done fairly the
 
04:53:20.190 --> 04:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
other thing is I think um we've moved
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
into um a technology uh age here where
 
04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe if we were having this
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
conversation 10 years ago and it was a
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
one-off of well I don't feel like this
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
station's doing it the same way as that
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
one or that this inspection was fair um
 
04:53:36.670 --> 04:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
I've seen firsthand and I've testified
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
before this committee um goni Mazda
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
right here in conquered uh Amanda mmer
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the owner uh invited us up
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
some time ago to see how inspections are
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
conducted there um I saw inspections
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
that were going on with the customer
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking through the glass to see the
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
inspection taking place and the video
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's produced after the fact with the
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
mechanic going through with each section
 
04:54:03.150 --> 04:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle that was inspected to say
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's red uh it needs to be repaired it's
 
04:54:08.548 --> 04:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
green it passes it's yellow and it needs
 
04:54:11.470 --> 04:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
some attention um many in and Dan
 
04:54:12.868 --> 04:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
Bennett can speak to this more than I
 
04:54:15.310 --> 04:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
can but many inspection stations around
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
the state are using this technology to
 
04:54:19.948 --> 04:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
improve transparency so between that on
 
04:54:22.628 --> 04:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
the front end and Troop G and the AI on
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
the back end um I think we're in
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
probably the best place we've ever been
 
04:54:29.390 --> 04:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
with making sure that the public feels
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the inspection we're
 
04:54:33.628 --> 04:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction um the
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
other thing is I I want to share a
 
04:54:37.548 --> 04:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
personal story um since I've been in
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
this position I did have the opportunity
 
04:54:40.990 --> 04:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
to meet with the owner of a large
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
dealership here in the state who brought
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
me outside and showed me several Stacks
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
tall stacks of tires um that had been
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
taken off of vehicles uh when they had
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
come in for their yearly state
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
inspection and that was it for me when I
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
saw those tires row after row after row
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
and asked the question that those are
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
from inspections those would have still
 
04:55:02.830 --> 04:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
been out there if they hadn't come in
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
and been caught and so visually for me
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
that was uh that was the Clincher um so
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing with this particular
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
bill is I'm not quite sure uh on the
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
repeal of RSA
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
2665 um RSA 265
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
2665 uh affords the director of the DMV
 
04:55:24.510 --> 04:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity um when law enforcement
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
writes in on a vehicle that uh law
 
04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement believes is unsafe for the
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
roadway to take action for that I'm not
 
04:55:31.948 --> 04:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
sure how that would play out if this
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass if that would impede
 
04:55:36.110 --> 04:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
the administrative action that the DMV
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
can take in instances where to Captain
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
uchi's point there is something uh at
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
roadside that he sees doesn't think the
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle is fit for the road and wants to
 
04:55:46.750 --> 04:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
send an administrative request in to the
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
DMB um and the last thing I I would say
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
before taking any questions is we did
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
complete the fiscal note on this um so
 
04:55:55.390 --> 04:55:55.400 align:start position:0%

04:55:58.110 --> 04:55:58.120 align:start position:0%

you have the DMV have any uh data Trends
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of with respect to complaints
 
04:56:34.990 --> 04:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
in other words we've instituted some
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
changes legislatively to try and make uh
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
citizens access to to make a complaint
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
more easy so I'm curious to see what the
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
effect might have been on that if
 
04:56:49.548 --> 04:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
there's any data to show thank you
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%

you did ask for
 
04:57:11.878 --> 04:57:13.708 align:start position:0%
you did ask for
two

04:57:13.708 --> 04:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony earlier today that
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh there are fewer shops doing
 
04:57:22.510 --> 04:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
inspections and I'm also particular
 
04:57:25.150 --> 04:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
specifically about motorcycles so I was
 
04:57:27.548 --> 04:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
curious if you track data the number of
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
numbers of shops that do motorcycle
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
inspections and car inspections and if
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
there's any Trend that is identifiable
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
for that as well we can get you that as
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
well representative we all of the
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
openings for inspection stations and
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
renewals every two years um go through
 
04:57:44.110 --> 04:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
the DMV go through Liz and her team and
 
04:57:45.548 --> 04:57:45.558 align:start position:0%
registration so we can get you the
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
numbers for the number of stations and
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
try to break down that information that
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%

from your position you're more worried
 
04:58:08.110 --> 04:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
about the safety part of it than the
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
emissions part of the inspection process
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%

some of the testimony prior to my my
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
coming up here
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%

inspected in the state every year but we
 
04:58:50.350 --> 04:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
will make sure we have that uh exact
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
information that's that's what we have
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%

second committee bill so I don't know
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%

04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
as soon as you can would be great
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%

going to be looking at trying to exec
 
04:59:10.230 --> 04:59:10.240 align:start position:0%

I think I have a
 
04:59:50.628 --> 04:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
question I have a question of the chair
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:59:56.430 --> 04:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm I was curious enough we had
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
anyone from the insurance department uh
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
testifying apparently we do not um I
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's a methodology for us
 
05:00:07.310 --> 05:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
to uh for the committee researcher who's
 
05:00:11.708 --> 05:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
not here today but to have him find out
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
um if they have any data
 
05:00:17.548 --> 05:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
correlating uh
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
Nationwide between insurance rates and
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
inspection programs um I've seen we hear
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
a lot about there's no correlation but
 
05:00:30.750 --> 05:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh a quick internet search uh from on my
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
part found too
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
independent uh not a not a public agency
 
05:00:42.270 --> 05:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
and not a a uh interest group but rather
 
05:00:44.948 --> 05:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh well one of them was for instance
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
Car and Driver magazine um who said
 
05:00:50.190 --> 05:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
There is a correlation and that it is
 
05:00:53.230 --> 05:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
favorable that the or not favorable in
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
that it those states that don't have
 
05:00:59.310 --> 05:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
inspections get uh have a higher rate of
 
05:01:02.070 --> 05:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
insurance so I want to I want to confirm
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
that before I take it at face
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
value the answer to your question is yes
 
05:01:08.670 --> 05:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
we will have the researcher or myself
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
will reach out to the Comm Commissioner
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
of Insurance for insurance commissioner
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
and try to get some info on that
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
topic any well I have no other any other
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'm going to close
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
the public Mr chair I'm sorry quick
 
05:01:26.470 --> 05:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
question um did uh do we have a count of
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
online support and opposition did we get
 
05:01:31.788 --> 05:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
that I have no idea I don't know where
 
05:01:33.310 --> 05:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
Ted was
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
represent representative Gorski was
 
05:01:36.548 --> 05:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
getting them earlier I don't I don't
 
05:01:36.558 --> 05:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
getting them earlier I don't I don't
track

05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
track
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
those if you if you need it I'll find it
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
but that's available if you need it
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
but I representative Fox well I have a
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
note I thought uh representative Gorski
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
announced 167 in support and 55 opposed
 
05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that what you had that's not what you
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
have what I got this morning was support
 
05:02:07.948 --> 05:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
51 and it's and that's why I don't
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
usually rely on them for the public
 
05:02:15.110 --> 05:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
testimony portion of it it's our hearing
 
05:02:16.548 --> 05:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
I mean the disinformation is good when
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
we looking at the exact session and that
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
way the windows been closed uh so the
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
information is a little more uh accurate
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
rather than fluid so so uh everybody
 
05:02:29.670 --> 05:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
else good okay I'm going to close the
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Hos Bill

Hampshire last session you suggested
 
05:18:32.350 --> 05:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
that I should come back with a new bill
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
on personal electric vehicles uh this
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill with the amendment is intend ended
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to classify the newer
 
05:18:46.510 --> 05:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
pevs and improve education safety by
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
creating a safety certificate program as
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
now in place for ohrv and snowmobile
 
05:18:57.788 --> 05:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
operators a study committee or council
 
05:19:02.350 --> 05:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
is proposed to work on the details okay
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
this is a Hot Topic by the way around
 
05:19:07.270 --> 05:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
the country and New Hampshire can be at
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
the Forefront dealing with this issue
 
05:19:12.548 --> 05:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
there is a need to protect people on
 
05:19:16.628 --> 05:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
roads rail trails and multi-use
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
paths as these vehicles become more
 
05:19:22.910 --> 05:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
numerous these protections are both for
 
05:19:26.830 --> 05:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
the people using the PS as well as those
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
they encounter children people with
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs Etc dealers are selling
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
electric motorcycles as if they were
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
ebikes this law would have the dealers
 
05:19:38.760 --> 05:19:40.110 align:start position:0%
ebikes this law would have the dealers
inform

05:19:40.110 --> 05:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
inform
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
customers about uses of pevs and require
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
safety training resulting in safe a
 
05:19:48.240 --> 05:19:49.788 align:start position:0%
safety training resulting in safe a
safety

05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
certificate you may not have seen some
 
05:19:54.990 --> 05:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
of the newer pevs unless you live in a
 
05:19:57.390 --> 05:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
larger City or there happens to be one
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
on your town roads I wish I could show
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
you some videos that I've seen it's
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
amazing some of the problems that you
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
would see in these videos if you have
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
not seen them it or the PS themselves it
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
probably won't be long before you do see
 
05:20:17.470 --> 05:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
them in the meantime the safety issues
 
05:20:20.350 --> 05:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
are definitely cropping up and need to
 
05:20:20.360 --> 05:20:21.670 align:start position:0%
are definitely cropping up and need to
be

05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
addressed New Hampshire can be ahead of
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
the issue I believe this bill with
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment which you should have is a
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
good start to address this
 
05:20:38.670 --> 05:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
issue after me technical issues question
 
05:20:41.310 --> 05:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
questions can be answered by Mr Dave
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
topam who will be speaking after
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
me you should have the amendment and you
 
05:20:49.150 --> 05:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
should have this little testimony that I
 
05:20:49.160 --> 05:20:49.990 align:start position:0%
should have this little testimony that I
just

05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:20:53.670 --> 05:20:53.680 align:start position:0%

any questions from the committee
 
05:20:57.990 --> 05:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
05:20:59.548 --> 05:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
for coming before us today um you and I
 
05:21:06.430 --> 05:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
served on a uh rail trail um bill at one
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
point uh not too long ago and and in
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
there there was a question about
 
05:21:17.070 --> 05:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
whether uh the federal government had
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
classified electric
 
05:21:22.230 --> 05:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles um for the rail
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
trail um and it was in relation to
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
whether they could be used on rail
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
trails that had Federal funding at all
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
because they were classified differently
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
is this is this touching upon any of
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
that Federal classification of electric
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
bikes and the fact that they could not
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
be used on federally funded rail
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
Trails well I
 
05:21:52.830 --> 05:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
don't not looking public so I'm going to
 
05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
say no I don't quite understand some of
 
05:21:56.708 --> 05:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
the part of what you're asking me but I
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
know this bill does uh um explain the
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
different classifications and what they
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
can do what they can't do and as I said
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
Mr topam could be more specific about
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
about that particular part of it okay I
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
I'll hang off for that yeah I'm sorry no
 
05:22:17.430 --> 05:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%

few times I'm trying to figure out how
 
05:22:29.110 --> 05:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
this plays off of things like electric
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
scooters and electric wheelchairs for
 
05:22:32.270 --> 05:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
the handicap including those that are
 
05:22:33.788 --> 05:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
cap I can't quite hear what you're
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
saying uh electric scooters and electric
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs for the handicap which are
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
capable of going off-road or may have
 
05:22:40.510 --> 05:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
more power than this because of what
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're designed for how does this play
 
05:22:45.070 --> 05:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
with that I still don't understand say
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
say it again into this microphone just I
 
05:22:48.990 --> 05:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
have trouble
 
05:22:50.948 --> 05:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
hearing I just couldn't hear what you
 
05:22:53.230 --> 05:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
were saying let's try this I'm G to shut
 
05:22:54.510 --> 05:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
yours off for a minute because sometimes
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
honorable representative can you hear
 
05:23:05.990 --> 05:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
me okay so my question is and I read
 
05:23:07.390 --> 05:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
through it a couple times it doesn't I
 
05:23:10.110 --> 05:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
don't see any provision for uh
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs handicap scooters including
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
those that are made for off-road
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
Recreation for the handicap is it the
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill that those would be
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
included in
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
this well we do include uh the scooters
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
and the uh other other things is that
 
05:23:28.990 --> 05:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:31.230 --> 05:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
mean there's a separate law that exists
 
05:23:33.310 --> 05:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
that covers that okay thank
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
05:23:39.310 --> 05:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
hlin thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative um my question concerns
 
05:23:46.270 --> 05:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
it says that in the amendment it says
 
05:23:50.350 --> 05:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
that operators 12 years and older have
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
to complete a course what about
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
12 I don't know what to how to answer
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
you I would think that uh that would be
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
up to the parents at that point I don't
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
really know I'm not going into the uh
 
05:24:12.150 --> 05:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
those details for me at this point
 
05:24:15.708 --> 05:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
anyway I don't I don't
 
05:24:18.910 --> 05:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
know how to answer
 
05:24:22.030 --> 05:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
you I have just one myself and it it
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
follows up with representative Hill i i
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
chaired a commission a few years ago
 
05:24:31.830 --> 05:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with non-typical Motor
 
05:24:34.110 --> 05:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
Vehicles we stayed away from it at the
 
05:24:36.310 --> 05:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
time because we were told by that the
 
05:24:38.590 --> 05:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
federal government was in the process of
 
05:24:41.230 --> 05:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
defining all these themselves and we
 
05:24:43.628 --> 05:24:43.638 align:start position:0%
thought that if we spent any time coming
 
05:24:45.628 --> 05:24:45.638 align:start position:0%
up with laws that contradicted it it
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
would be a waste of time have you heard
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
of any movement at the federal level on
 
05:24:52.590 --> 05:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
coming up with definitions and
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
classifications for these
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles I have heard of nothing from
 
05:25:00.070 --> 05:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government and there are
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
organizations all around the country
 
05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
that we have been getting together with
 
05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
to discuss this bill and everybody is
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about it and wants to have
 
05:25:10.080 --> 05:25:10.948 align:start position:0%
concerned about it and wants to have
something

05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:25:13.868 --> 05:25:13.878 align:start position:0%
done within the states obviously since
 
05:25:16.150 --> 05:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government is not doing
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
anything thank you very much any other
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr chair
 
05:25:24.430 --> 05:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
05:25:29.430 --> 05:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
my question um on the second page of the
 
05:25:34.110 --> 05:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
bill um it states on line 23 and
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
24 operation of a peev over speed limit
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a violation and shall be punishable
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
by a fine commensurate with any motor
 
05:25:45.750 --> 05:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle traveling above the speed limit
 
05:25:48.670 --> 05:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess my question is is who will
 
05:25:48.680 --> 05:25:50.470 align:start position:0%
and I guess my question is is who will
enforce

05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
05:25:54.750 --> 05:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
that issue well I would guess it's the
 
05:25:57.430 --> 05:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
same thing as with anything these days
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know uh I don't know maybe Mr Choo
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
might know more specifically the answer
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
to that question but uh you know they
 
05:26:09.070 --> 05:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
they have to be caught first of all
 
05:26:09.080 --> 05:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
they have to be caught first of all
thank

05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%

05:26:22.750 --> 05:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
the Bill yes definitely there's a couple
 
05:26:24.750 --> 05:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
points that the amendment is covering
 
05:26:26.590 --> 05:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about the bill and
 
05:26:28.670 --> 05:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
then when they saw the amendment they
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
realized that the amendment is
 
05:26:32.190 --> 05:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
alleviating some of the issues that
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
people had
 
05:26:34.000 --> 05:26:35.868 align:start position:0%
people had
before

05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%

quick background my pleasure to be with
 
05:27:16.590 --> 05:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
you again I did speak on this particular
 
05:27:18.110 --> 05:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
topic last year
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
also for those of you who don't know me
 
05:27:23.788 --> 05:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
basically I have a background in
 
05:27:26.230 --> 05:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
bicycling as a certified cycling
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
instructor and also basically as a
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
part-time volunteer working for DOT for
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
45 years I will say literally there has
 
05:27:37.350 --> 05:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
been a single program safety brochure
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
anything that came about through DT in
 
05:27:41.548 --> 05:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
the past 45 years I haven't known about
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
somehow rather had my fingerprint on so
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
basically I have some gray hair and glad
 
05:27:48.110 --> 05:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
to do do what I can moving
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
ahead also say back in 2019 I was a
 
05:27:55.070 --> 05:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
primary author of House Bill 148 which
 
05:27:57.670 --> 05:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
made true ebikes I'm talking class one
 
05:28:02.030 --> 05:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
two3 ebikes legal here in New Hampshire
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay we had also a legislation we put in
 
05:28:08.628 --> 05:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
last year which was not that well
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
defined that was House Bill 1543 that's
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically what water over the dam at
 
05:28:14.000 --> 05:28:15.070 align:start position:0%
basically what water over the dam at
this

05:28:15.070 --> 05:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
point now we're looking at outer class
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles primarily here in this
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:28:24.830 --> 05:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
715 it's a quick wear about my other
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
background I serve on multiple boards
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
including bike Walker Alliance of New
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%

Coalition also on the board for the
 
05:28:40.430 --> 05:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
grant State rail trail and probably most
 
05:28:42.030 --> 05:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
important for today's discussion where
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
we go from here I'm a member of the
 
05:28:46.590 --> 05:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Traffic Safety
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
commission look your folks on boy here
 
05:28:54.510 --> 05:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
today so and Linda gold represent gou
 
05:28:56.150 --> 05:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
just passed out something to you which
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
I'll refer to briefly this is nine pages
 
05:29:02.430 --> 05:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
some color printing at all not to
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
belabor it but say this is something you
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
can glance at because I find one of the
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
key factors and talking with my friends
 
05:29:10.830 --> 05:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
here in depart uh Department of
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
Transportation as well a key factor is
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
education education what it is that
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about what are the
 
05:29:20.708 --> 05:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles who's using them where are they
 
05:29:23.708 --> 05:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
using them why are they using them so
 
05:29:25.948 --> 05:29:25.958 align:start position:0%
hand in hand with that overall concept
 
05:29:28.270 --> 05:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
of what's going on
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
here we have I have been personally
 
05:29:33.788 --> 05:29:33.798 align:start position:0%
involved for the past year I won't say
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
how many hours but definitely at least
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
eight working sessions
 
05:29:41.830 --> 05:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
involving about 10 States including
 
05:29:44.110 --> 05:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
National organizations including the
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
league of American bicyclists Rails to
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
Trails Conservancy people for bikes
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
based in
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
argon and one of the most informative
 
05:29:56.350 --> 05:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
sessions that I had recently and glad to
 
05:30:00.190 --> 05:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
get the input in August I attended the
 
05:30:02.030 --> 05:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
traffic safety commission meeting over
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
here the Theos building and a lot of
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
input was received then that caused me
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
to rethink some of my overall
 
05:30:12.190 --> 05:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
perspectives that I had received from
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
the outside world talking to the other
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
organizations by clubs Regional groups
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
you name it again there's probably
 
05:30:20.470 --> 05:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours that g into that in
 
05:30:23.868 --> 05:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
the past year or that I boil it down to
 
05:30:25.750 --> 05:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
what I call a series of viewpoints what
 
05:30:29.110 --> 05:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
do I think kind of coales the whole
 
05:30:31.788 --> 05:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
thing together a couple key points I
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
think I just like to mention before we
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
get into any nitty-gritty details here I
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
think you all have to admit that techn
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
ology moves much faster than
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation you know the advance of
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
these newer
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
devices whether they are the I call it
 
05:30:51.070 --> 05:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
the outer class otic Vehicles OCS
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
motorcycles with pedals that can go 60
 
05:30:55.708 --> 05:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
mil hour by hitting a throttle button
 
05:30:58.470 --> 05:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
and being sold and used as F bikes if
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about high-speed scooters
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
onewheel devices and even now electric
 
05:31:07.470 --> 05:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
unicycles these are newer units that in
 
05:31:08.910 --> 05:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
fact a lot of people don't even know
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about so the first
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
few pages of this handout basically just
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
tries to Define what they are where they
 
05:31:18.270 --> 05:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
use I won't go into the details but
 
05:31:20.670 --> 05:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
again class one 123 ebikes are totally
 
05:31:22.830 --> 05:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
legal here in New Hampshire with the
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
caveat being the class three that can
 
05:31:27.030 --> 05:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
contain 28 miles hour if you are
 
05:31:29.510 --> 05:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
pedaling not allowed on rail
 
05:31:32.830 --> 05:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
Trails so at Federal standards there was
 
05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
a question I asked a little bit earlier
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
has not changed nationally at all that
 
05:31:41.548 --> 05:31:41.558 align:start position:0%
ebikes true ebikes class one two three
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
are classified still as bicycles
 
05:31:45.470 --> 05:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
low-speed electric
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
bicycles they are allowed on rail Trails
 
05:31:51.190 --> 05:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
all the way through even federally
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
funded ones because again they are
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
bicycles they're not Motor Vehicles
 
05:31:57.788 --> 05:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
that's the key factor they're not motor
 
05:31:59.910 --> 05:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles and that's the way the law is
 
05:32:01.470 --> 05:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
written currently here in New
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my problem our problems rail
 
05:32:07.548 --> 05:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
trail folks are and Road users you see a
 
05:32:10.390 --> 05:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
picture here on about page three about
 
05:32:13.868 --> 05:32:13.878 align:start position:0%
what they call this 12,000 watt Mad Boss
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
bike 16 horsepower it'll do 60 mil an
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
hour it's being sold as if it's an ebike
 
05:32:25.628 --> 05:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
even in Dairy if it is go use it it's
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
all an ebike no registration no
 
05:32:31.708 --> 05:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
licensing no training just take it and
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
run so they have a problem especially
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
when they're on even roads I see talk
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
about Lane SP in vehicles on roads it
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
still comes down the fact that these
 
05:32:43.310 --> 05:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles are all over the place again
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
with no license no registration they're
 
05:32:46.590 --> 05:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
just out
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
there the guideline by the way that came
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
about that to set the guidelines for
 
05:32:53.390 --> 05:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
ebikes came out in 2003 from the
 
05:32:55.628 --> 05:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
consumer product safety commission
 
05:32:57.868 --> 05:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
that's been recently revised and they're
 
05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
looking at currently battery safety
 
05:33:04.030 --> 05:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
safety characteristics breaking all well
 
05:33:05.788 --> 05:33:05.798 align:start position:0%
and fine I've been following those
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
details intimately but they are not
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
looking at where and how these devices
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
are used they're not saying about they
 
05:33:16.030 --> 05:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
be used on roads or not so keeping on
 
05:33:18.190 --> 05:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
from there a little bit about the
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
definitions we talked about I'm viewing
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
everything and the spill views
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
everything that is above the one
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
horsepower 750 watt if you would powered
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
speed of 20 mil an hour which is the
 
05:33:34.270 --> 05:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
limit for True ebikes class 1 two 3 they
 
05:33:36.430 --> 05:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
are not powered over 20 M an
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
hour how ever this is not attempting to
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
address I call the lowend electric
 
05:33:46.270 --> 05:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
recreational toys the girl has a little
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
Barbie Jeep in the driveway that might
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
go 5 or 12 miles an hour that's a
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
recreational toy they don't blow belong
 
05:33:56.110 --> 05:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
on our roads by the transportation
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
system anyway so that gets a basically I
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
view that is local municipalities got to
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
control that when your neighborhood they
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
might be allowed on sidewalks they might
 
05:34:08.070 --> 05:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
not I don't want to get into that I'm
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
looking at Transportation type
 
05:34:14.910 --> 05:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so saying up front that the
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
bike ped community in K Julia I'm not
 
05:34:21.030 --> 05:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
against these higher powered devices but
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
where and how they are used is the
 
05:34:26.190 --> 05:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
problem they do provide opportunities
 
05:34:28.590 --> 05:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
for many people maybe they can't afford
 
05:34:32.190 --> 05:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
a car maybe they're handicapped we talk
 
05:34:34.590 --> 05:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
about ADA Compliant folks all these
 
05:34:37.990 --> 05:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
devices can be used by Ada type folks
 
05:34:39.548 --> 05:34:39.558 align:start position:0%
just using that term
 
05:34:41.948 --> 05:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
generically because they need Mobility
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
to get around and the Mobil Ada law says
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
basically they can use basically what
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
they want within normal limitations
 
05:34:52.030 --> 05:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
including on rail throughs so again the
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
Ada folks basically got a free slate to
 
05:34:58.030 --> 05:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
use what they want no question about
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
that whether they're electrically
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
powered or not
 
05:35:04.110 --> 05:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
see main thing I see up front is
 
05:35:07.390 --> 05:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
basically Kon courtesy whereby so many
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
people even motorists on the road if
 
05:35:12.430 --> 05:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
they display a bit common courtesy about
 
05:35:14.510 --> 05:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
handling things correctly we're a lot
 
05:35:14.520 --> 05:35:15.390 align:start position:0%
handling things correctly we're a lot
better

05:35:15.390 --> 05:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
off and keeping in fact we talk about
 
05:35:20.430 --> 05:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
the speed capability of some of these
 
05:35:23.070 --> 05:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
devices I think it's wa page four or so
 
05:35:26.110 --> 05:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
of this handout you've got a chart that
 
05:35:27.788 --> 05:35:27.798 align:start position:0%
lists a
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
comparison of different types of
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles whether they're ebikes oped
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
scooters all up the
 
05:35:37.230 --> 05:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
motorcycles whether they're registered
 
05:35:39.310 --> 05:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
or not the horsepower
 
05:35:42.030 --> 05:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
range I've come to realize and I think
 
05:35:45.788 --> 05:35:45.798 align:start position:0%
you will also It Isn't So Much the power
 
05:35:49.390 --> 05:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
or speed that a device is capable of
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's how it is being
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
used we all drive cars I think everyone
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
in the room is driving a car it might be
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
able to do 120 30 miles an hour on an
 
05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
open road it's totally legal if you
 
05:36:04.590 --> 05:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
driving 65 M hour on Route 93 it's
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
totally legal if you're using it for 30
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
m hour a congest the urban
 
05:36:11.548 --> 05:36:11.558 align:start position:0%
area just because the vehicle can go
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
fast doesn't mean it has to be used at
 
05:36:14.040 --> 05:36:15.230 align:start position:0%
fast doesn't mean it has to be used at
that

05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
speed so just keep in mind I think speed
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
is actually more important than the
 
05:36:23.830 --> 05:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
classification and power off harow of a
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
device now get again the idea of equity
 
05:36:28.110 --> 05:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
I mention a little bit the folks who
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
need to get around whether they've lost
 
05:36:30.360 --> 05:36:31.110 align:start position:0%
need to get around whether they've lost
a

05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
license like a DUI case talking with
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
folks Department of Safety just a little
 
05:36:37.150 --> 05:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
bit ago some of these folks have no
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
other way to get around and if they can
 
05:36:43.548 --> 05:36:43.558 align:start position:0%
use an ebike or a vehicle of some sort
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
to accomplish their needs missions food
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
whatever oh well and fine I don't see a
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
problem with that provided they are
 
05:36:53.070 --> 05:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
following the
 
05:36:56.110 --> 05:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
law again wrapping up my little quick
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony here might be more than four
 
05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
minutes at this point talking with
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles a bit some
 
05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
of these devices do not have uh VIN
 
05:37:08.510 --> 05:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
numbers on ver vehicle identification
 
05:37:10.868 --> 05:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
numbers becomes a little bit problematic
 
05:37:12.150 --> 05:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
how you register them if you don't have
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
a number secondarily as I found out in
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
the world of effectively electric
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
unicycles which again little picture
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
over there the one wheel where you stand
 
05:37:25.470 --> 05:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
to sit on that and you just go that a
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
lot of those folks don't own one of
 
05:37:29.230 --> 05:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
these devices for three or four months
 
05:37:30.590 --> 05:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
before they rotate out and they get a
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
different one it's like a hobby but
 
05:37:34.750 --> 05:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I know people even in the
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
lights of in someone in Nash is using
 
05:37:40.110 --> 05:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
one of those to get around because he us
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
a sa he can't walk but he can use the EU
 
05:37:46.030 --> 05:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
to get around town so not a problem
 
05:37:47.830 --> 05:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
might be ADA Compliant maybe hasn't gone
 
05:37:50.310 --> 05:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
that route but he still use them for
 
05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
transportation and not opposed to that
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
personally and the idea is again the
 
05:37:58.270 --> 05:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
education that was brought up in the
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
amendment basically the main point of
 
05:38:03.150 --> 05:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment we have a lot of things to
 
05:38:05.548 --> 05:38:05.558 align:start position:0%
discuss more than we can we the weeds
 
05:38:07.470 --> 05:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
too much of this afternoon and
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time but it still comes
 
05:38:11.548 --> 05:38:11.558 align:start position:0%
down the fact we talked about having a
 
05:38:14.910 --> 05:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
safety education type of a program ourr
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
the safety certificate program you folks
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
probably know full well that our fishing
 
05:38:23.750 --> 05:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
game has the safety program for again
 
05:38:26.110 --> 05:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
ag12 you ask where that came from i z in
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
on that ag1 12 and up they have the
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
safety certificate program for children
 
05:38:34.590 --> 05:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
if you would getting onto snowmobiles
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
and ohvs they take this online course
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
they get a safety certificate they're
 
05:38:42.030 --> 05:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
required to carry it say yes they know
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
something about this device that they're
 
05:38:46.430 --> 05:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
getting on not getting on there suddenly
 
05:38:48.270 --> 05:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
hit the thr autle and crash because they
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going
 
05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
on they do charge a minor fee for that I
 
05:38:55.548 --> 05:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
think it's about $35 and it's not a
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
license it's basically saying you've had
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
training you have some
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
information when it getes of how that
 
05:39:04.350 --> 05:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
can come about I'm fully aware the state
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is under very tight
 
05:39:07.830 --> 05:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
budgets things are being cut back a lot
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
this year there's not enough money to go
 
05:39:13.150 --> 05:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
around I've been working with uh groups
 
05:39:17.708 --> 05:39:17.718 align:start position:0%
around the country including s Francisco
 
05:39:20.468 --> 05:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
University program and they have the
 
05:39:22.468 --> 05:39:22.478 align:start position:0%
skills and wherewith all to help to
 
05:39:24.868 --> 05:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
develop the cost a little to no cost at
 
05:39:27.270 --> 05:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
all to the state if there was a minor
 
05:39:28.948 --> 05:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
seed money I'm told that folks in the
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
department of safety might have a little
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
bit of money to help kick that off get
 
05:39:35.910 --> 05:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
it going but not State money so this is
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
not impacting state budget
 
05:39:40.830 --> 05:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
if we were to develop a program the
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
content of the program however it
 
05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist today in the country
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere I've looked high and low we do
 
05:39:49.948 --> 05:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
not have a program we just go out and
 
05:39:54.030 --> 05:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
grab it for ebikes especially the EU
 
05:39:56.270 --> 05:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
community so what we try to do is to
 
05:39:59.190 --> 05:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
call us enough I picked up the ter from
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety dispatch you
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts if you would
 
05:40:03.788 --> 05:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
officials really know what they're
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
talking about if we can get together as
 
05:40:10.190 --> 05:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
a committee or a council if so directed
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
with this amendment we have out that we
 
05:40:14.270 --> 05:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
can meet offline and flesh out what
 
05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
really makes sense what could be put
 
05:40:19.468 --> 05:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
into a program to direct people to take
 
05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
it to become safer operators of these
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles whether they're on roads Trails
 
05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
or whatever they need training they need
 
05:40:29.788 --> 05:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
education it doesn't exist today so
 
05:40:31.628 --> 05:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
we're looking for a consensus of
 
05:40:33.868 --> 05:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
opinions to move it ahead with I call
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
the legisla directed committee or
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we can review the idea of putting
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
together a safety certificate program
 
05:40:44.910 --> 05:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
then steer people to it we can't tell
 
05:40:47.948 --> 05:40:47.958 align:start position:0%
people to take it when it doesn't exist
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
plain and
 
05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
simple so that's my my sped probably
 
05:40:53.868 --> 05:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
over four minutes but entertain any
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
comments or questions at this point
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're right it was
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
much more than four minutes I think I
 
05:41:01.548 --> 05:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
have a question over here representative
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman um I have to
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
confess I'm confused by what you're
 
05:41:10.510 --> 05:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
looking for with this legislation um
 
05:41:13.628 --> 05:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
other than perhaps even just classifying
 
05:41:13.638 --> 05:41:14.628 align:start position:0%
other than perhaps even just classifying
certain

05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:41:19.030 --> 05:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
things um as either motor-driven Cycles
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
or personal electric vehicles all kinds
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
of things but I also in in following up
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat on chairman Walsh some of this
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
is I believe under consideration by the
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
federal government as we speak although
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
maybe not at a snails pace here um but I
 
05:41:44.670 --> 05:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
am concerned there was another bill that
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
we had last year not yours that was
 
05:41:51.868 --> 05:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
concerning because of the motor um the
 
05:41:54.590 --> 05:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
electric motor vehicles were being
 
05:41:58.750 --> 05:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
suggested by some um judges for people
 
05:42:01.030 --> 05:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
that had lost their license to go get
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
one of the electric bicycles that um
 
05:42:07.948 --> 05:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
were perhaps even going as high as 60 M
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
hour which I think the minimum a speed
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
on the highway is is 45 so they would
 
05:42:16.670 --> 05:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
qualify to ride on on the highways
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
without licenses or registrations so I
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
see the need I'm I'm wondering what it
 
05:42:26.468 --> 05:42:26.478 align:start position:0%
is you want us to do do you want us to
 
05:42:28.670 --> 05:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
create a study committee I don't see
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
those words here I see it in testimony
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
but not words so I'm I'm trying to find
 
05:42:36.788 --> 05:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
out what it is you want done I might ask
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
ask that two parts first of all as far
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
as the use of vehicles are concerned
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's the DUI crowd whatever they
 
05:42:45.948 --> 05:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
want Wheels to get around the problem we
 
05:42:47.548 --> 05:42:47.558 align:start position:0%
have with somebody is on one of these
 
05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
quote electric motorcycles whatever the
 
05:42:52.190 --> 05:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
16 horsepower one for example reference
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
over here currently they are not
 
05:42:57.390 --> 05:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
classified as a motor vehicle if they
 
05:42:59.468 --> 05:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
were classified as a motor vehicle I'm
 
05:43:03.670 --> 05:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
all in favor of that on the rsas Today a
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle including a motorcycle can
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
be electrically driven it doesn't it's
 
05:43:10.468 --> 05:43:10.478 align:start position:0%
not excluded as a motor vehicle because
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's got a battery on it okay so if
 
05:43:16.468 --> 05:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
these higher class uh Vehicles higher
 
05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
speed higher power were in fact
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
classified as Motor Vehicles then they
 
05:43:24.468 --> 05:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
would have to be registered insured
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
licensed operator and the law would be
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
there to take action on because if
 
05:43:31.548 --> 05:43:31.558 align:start position:0%
you're using an unauthorized vehicle on
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I've got to ask a question
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
here are you all set yeah just in terms
 
05:43:45.310 --> 05:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill itself how it's written
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
itself I I'm a little confused as I read
 
05:43:49.430 --> 05:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
through this too it just kind of sends
 
05:43:51.350 --> 05:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
you in a bunch of different directions
 
05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
for example on page two line one
 
05:43:58.990 --> 05:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
through five of the bill I'm not even
 
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment
 
05:44:03.070 --> 05:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
yet uh due to the nature of a personal
 
05:44:04.990 --> 05:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles not having vehicle
 
05:44:06.750 --> 05:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
identification numbers and frequent
 
05:44:09.070 --> 05:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
change ownership a typical vehicle
 
05:44:10.708 --> 05:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
registration is
 
05:44:13.628 --> 05:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
Impractical instead a person operating a
 
05:44:15.070 --> 05:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
personal electric vehicle must be
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
certified it's a skilled user by
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
completing the New Hampshire Department
 
05:44:20.788 --> 05:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicle Safety exam what do
 
05:44:22.830 --> 05:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
those two things have in common and how
 
05:44:25.230 --> 05:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
do they relate to each other how can you
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
just because you don't have one how do
 
05:44:28.868 --> 05:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
we change the whole topic and go into
 
05:44:30.830 --> 05:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
something else point so address a bit I
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
think in the amendment first of all
 
05:44:34.350 --> 05:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
again you can't take a course that
 
05:44:36.868 --> 05:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist we think we have to admit
 
05:44:36.878 --> 05:44:37.548 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist we think we have to admit
that

05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:44:41.350 --> 05:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then secondarily as far as what's
 
05:44:43.390 --> 05:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
required moving
 
05:44:46.270 --> 05:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
ahead we want people to be safe on the
 
05:44:48.350 --> 05:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
road they should be skilled in what
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing and the idea is if we have
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
a committee to work out the Weeds on
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
this and fine-tune this to make it more
 
05:45:01.310 --> 05:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
meaningful again I don't expect this
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill to at the least be passed the way
 
05:45:06.990 --> 05:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's written today I'll tell you that
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
but if we say this is enough of a
 
05:45:10.430 --> 05:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
problem that we need to get our heads
 
05:45:12.670 --> 05:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
together and work out the details
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
through like of a study committee
 
05:45:16.708 --> 05:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
whatever you wish to call if it's so
 
05:45:19.230 --> 05:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
directed we can work out the details
 
05:45:21.230 --> 05:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
because right now law enforcement
 
05:45:23.548 --> 05:45:23.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what to call these things
 
05:45:27.310 --> 05:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
they running around rail Trails roadways
 
05:45:27.320 --> 05:45:28.270 align:start position:0%
they running around rail Trails roadways
state

05:45:28.270 --> 05:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
parks and basically we need to get hands
 
05:45:33.868 --> 05:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
or handle around it and again we can't
 
05:45:35.868 --> 05:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
do it all today the weding of the
 
05:45:38.910 --> 05:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
original bill and even the amendment
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really cover everything and I'll
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
just say that even as recently as last
 
05:45:46.708 --> 05:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
night the online kist the online portal
 
05:45:48.468 --> 05:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
that was quite interesting how see the
 
05:45:51.390 --> 05:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
account was going on that one that
 
05:45:54.190 --> 05:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
basically people are saying that we need
 
05:45:55.310 --> 05:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:46:00.390 --> 05:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
something the C is up here I think of
 
05:46:05.310 --> 05:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh last last night was a 26 saying do
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
something favoring the bill in
 
05:46:09.670 --> 05:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
generalities and five
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
against it's also interesting to note
 
05:46:13.708 --> 05:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
that some of the comments came in one of
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
the oppositions you read the text behind
 
05:46:18.270 --> 05:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
it 100% in favor of doing something but
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
he click the wrong button so you can't
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
always just go away those numbers but
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
any case bottom line we have more work
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
to do on it and that's why I'm hoping to
 
05:46:27.948 --> 05:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
have this uh quote study committee
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
whatever you wish to call it so we can
 
05:46:32.430 --> 05:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
address the issues the vehicles are here
 
05:46:34.590 --> 05:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
they're driving people crazy back here
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
in August at the safety commission
 
05:46:36.558 --> 05:46:37.628 align:start position:0%
in August at the safety commission
meeting

05:46:37.628 --> 05:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:46:39.750 --> 05:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
we had three officers from the
 
05:46:42.030 --> 05:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department we had
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
someone else from Kean we had State
 
05:46:46.590 --> 05:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
Police we had DMV all say this is a
 
05:46:48.150 --> 05:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
problem how can we get our hands around
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
it so I'm still trying to get my hands
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
around the whole thing and there's some
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
deviation yes in the text I fully agree
 
05:46:58.110 --> 05:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
with you Mr W that again we need to work
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
on it that answers my question a little
 
05:47:01.590 --> 05:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
bit but any other questions from the
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative hin thank you
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you for being here
 
05:47:09.150 --> 05:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
today um so I'll go back to my earlier
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
question I posed before um whereas I
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't see anything that it has age
 
05:47:19.468 --> 05:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
restriction as far as who can or cannot
 
05:47:22.948 --> 05:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
use these the only age restriction comes
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
to if you're 12 years old according to
 
05:47:29.468 --> 05:47:29.478 align:start position:0%
the amendment you have to show a safety
 
05:47:33.990 --> 05:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
course but as a 10-year-old my grandson
 
05:47:37.510 --> 05:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
does not have to have
 
05:47:41.548 --> 05:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
any type of a safety course he can just
 
05:47:46.990 --> 05:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
use any electric PV on the uh rail
 
05:47:47.000 --> 05:47:48.628 align:start position:0%
use any electric PV on the uh rail
Trails

05:47:48.628 --> 05:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
Trails
 
05:47:51.868 --> 05:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
correct well stting off with a 12 year
 
05:47:54.468 --> 05:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
old Point that's defined in the current
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
stipulations for those getting the
 
05:47:58.270 --> 05:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
safety certificate from fishing game for
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
OHV or whatever being that they're all
 
05:48:02.590 --> 05:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
enough to understand rules of the road
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
they know left from right they know what
 
05:48:06.590 --> 05:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
some of the problems are a certain level
 
05:48:09.468 --> 05:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
of of recognition for hazards and they
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
can absorb things like rules of the road
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
basically come arbitary different kids
 
05:48:16.468 --> 05:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
different ranges you know different
 
05:48:19.628 --> 05:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
abilities ad midly but those under 12 we
 
05:48:21.548 --> 05:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
I view and I think most the other folks
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
view as basically their children they
 
05:48:26.110 --> 05:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the cognitive ability to
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
really sense dangers and do things so
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're under control of their parents
 
05:48:31.708 --> 05:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
the parents must have some
 
05:48:34.430 --> 05:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for their own children
 
05:48:36.110 --> 05:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
but even in the fishing game again they
 
05:48:38.590 --> 05:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
start there safety program 12 years old
 
05:48:41.468 --> 05:48:41.478 align:start position:0%
and up okay so that's where that 12
 
05:48:44.350 --> 05:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
years old came from again we're talk not
 
05:48:46.350 --> 05:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
talking about trying to get the little
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
girl on a pink Barbie Jeep and a
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:54.120 --> 05:48:55.708 align:start position:0%
 
parents

05:48:55.708 --> 05:48:55.718 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:48:59.628 --> 05:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
and representative Miller I thank you uh
 
05:49:01.628 --> 05:49:01.638 align:start position:0%
and I just want to follow up on the
 
05:49:04.230 --> 05:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
they're not classified as anything
 
05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
currently today and we don't know what
 
05:49:08.788 --> 05:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
they are can you I mean I just briefly
 
05:49:11.070 --> 05:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
looked through what a moped is for
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
example and it's anything that goes 30
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
miles per hour or less doesn't it could
 
05:49:19.150 --> 05:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
be any electric Moto or not y um a motor
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
driven cycle I believe the limit is a 5
 
05:49:22.830 --> 05:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
horsepower engine so if we're talking
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
about uh you know a higher a larger
 
05:49:27.628 --> 05:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
engine than that it would be something
 
05:49:30.670 --> 05:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
else but I'm curious is is it a problem
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
the state police have said that it's not
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know what these are is it
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
dealers don't know what these are who is
 
05:49:37.468 --> 05:49:37.478 align:start position:0%
saying we don't know what these are are
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
Vis the current legal structures we have
 
05:49:43.030 --> 05:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
that seems like really current answer no
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
one knows what to call them that's why
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to classify these again the
 
05:49:49.910 --> 05:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
chart that we have over here if these
 
05:49:52.708 --> 05:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles have the size weight power and
 
05:49:55.468 --> 05:49:55.478 align:start position:0%
everything of a motor vehicle the
 
05:49:56.670 --> 05:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
feeling is that they should be
 
05:49:59.310 --> 05:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
classified as a motor vehicle with again
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
registration Insurance whatever if it's
 
05:50:04.510 --> 05:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
a lightweight device and talking to the
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
EU at this particular point which is
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
about the same weight as an ebike you
 
05:50:13.190 --> 05:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
know 40 50 pounds maybe 60 whatever
 
05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
there cargo bikes are another category
 
05:50:17.910 --> 05:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
but it case basically if a device like
 
05:50:17.920 --> 05:50:18.590 align:start position:0%
but it case basically if a device like
the

05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:21.990 --> 05:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
unicycle is viewed more of a an
 
05:50:25.150 --> 05:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
ebike than a motor
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle because of the heads of the
 
05:50:31.430 --> 05:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
weights and everything a person on an EU
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a front wheel to crush if
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
he runs into something okay they
 
05:50:37.750 --> 05:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
typically wear heavy duty body arm
 
05:50:39.628 --> 05:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
regular motorcycle crash suits if you
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
would so basically they're usually very
 
05:50:43.590 --> 05:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on and they're
 
05:50:46.510 --> 05:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
very prone to injury if something goes
 
05:50:50.230 --> 05:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
astray and by the same token them using
 
05:50:52.468 --> 05:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
these devices they mentioned a fellow in
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
ASA whether he's tot fully under the Ada
 
05:50:57.430 --> 05:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
coverage or not people are using those
 
05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
for transportation to get around and if
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
they want to go on a rail trail as I've
 
05:51:04.910 --> 05:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
encountered folks in Salem 12 15 M an
 
05:51:07.390 --> 05:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
hour on an EU that might have a maximum
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
capable top speed of 50 it's totally
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:17.548 --> 05:51:17.558 align:start position:0%

Transportation as such my job or role is
 
05:51:53.350 --> 05:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
just to try to assure that the state
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
highways and roadways can accommodate
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
pedestrians and bicyclists are active

modes of transportation as as much as
practicable

05:52:02.990 --> 05:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
practicable
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
um the do has no position in this
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
particular bill I spoke here last year
 
05:52:10.270 --> 05:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
on a similar bill and the main concern
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
is that um electric bicycles were were
 
05:52:15.948 --> 05:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
in last year's bill and it's mentioned a
 
05:52:18.750 --> 05:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
little bit in this year's bill um there
 
05:52:20.430 --> 05:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
exists very good laws already in the
 
05:52:22.110 --> 05:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for electric
 
05:52:25.110 --> 05:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
bicycles uh the max speed for electric
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
bicycle class one and two pedal assist
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
is 20 M an hour and 28 miles an hour for
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
clash 3 uh they can go faster just like
 
05:52:37.948 --> 05:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
a regular non ebik can go um
 
05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
if you're going downhill so that's all
 
05:52:42.430 --> 05:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
just didn't want to mix up or throw the
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
baby out with the bath bath water here
 
05:52:46.830 --> 05:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
the the electric bicycles laws that
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
exist today already so and we encourage
 
05:52:51.868 --> 05:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
those at the Department of
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
Transportation as a form of
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
transportation and with that I just

Transportation agree that these devices
 
05:53:07.070 --> 05:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
particularly the two wield ones would
 
05:53:08.670 --> 05:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
not be a moped or motorcycle but would
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
be some other thing that is not
 
05:53:14.190 --> 05:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.200 --> 05:53:15.750 align:start position:0%

the testimony just recognize the

what they're trying to do here um you
 
05:54:01.468 --> 05:54:01.478 align:start position:0%
know I have been part of many
 
05:54:03.270 --> 05:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with Dave the office of
 
05:54:05.868 --> 05:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety um and many others about
 
05:54:07.708 --> 05:54:07.718 align:start position:0%
this issue I can tell you that in
 
05:54:10.390 --> 05:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
speaking with uh dmbb directors from
 
05:54:12.110 --> 05:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the country it's an issue in
 
05:54:13.990 --> 05:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
every state and people are trying to
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
figure out the best way to to solve it
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
or try to solve it um to save lives
 
05:54:21.070 --> 05:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
really that's what this testimony is all
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
about saving lives for the rider uh and
 
05:54:24.750 --> 05:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
for other people that might be on the
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
sidewalk and a an eunic cycle comes up
 
05:54:29.788 --> 05:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
behind you at 30 miles an hour um those
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
things are happening and so um what I
 
05:54:34.230 --> 05:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
have found through anva the American
 
05:54:35.390 --> 05:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
Association of Motor Vehicle
 
05:54:37.230 --> 05:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
administrators there have been surveys
 
05:54:38.990 --> 05:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
that have been sent out to DMVs
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
nationally on this issue and how they
 
05:54:42.270 --> 05:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
deal with it and what you'll find is a
 
05:54:44.190 --> 05:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
lot of times there's very little at the
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
state level most of it is handled
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
through town ordinance so they push it
 
05:54:49.750 --> 05:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
back to the town just like noise
 
05:54:52.150 --> 05:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh to try to deal with it but
 
05:54:53.548 --> 05:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
what Dave and the representative are
 
05:54:55.750 --> 05:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do with defining these
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles through um what's in this
 
05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
packet um that's arduous and and uh
 
05:55:03.310 --> 05:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of work um and I agree I
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the amendment to this bill
 
05:55:06.948 --> 05:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
but if the amendment is to create a
 
05:55:10.830 --> 05:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
committee um and to get uh subject
 
05:55:13.070 --> 05:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
matter experts if you will or other uh
 
05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
stakeholders around the table to talk
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
about what's in this packet and try to
 
05:55:18.990 --> 05:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
find a solution we're happy to work with
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh with Dave and the representative and
 
05:55:22.350 --> 05:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
I know that Lieutenant Storm from the
 
05:55:23.868 --> 05:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
state police from Highway Safety would
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that as well so I just
 
05:55:28.430 --> 05:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to offer that and um happy to
 
05:55:29.628 --> 05:55:29.638 align:start position:0%

05:55:32.350 --> 05:55:32.360 align:start position:0%

testimony so far in this bill has to do
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
with an educational component and a uh
 
05:55:44.910 --> 05:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
safety certificate program are those
 
05:55:46.990 --> 05:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
ready to go from the DMV or would they
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
have to be developed that's a great
 
05:55:49.628 --> 05:55:49.638 align:start position:0%
question representative they would have
 
05:55:53.390 --> 05:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%

what it would take to develop this kind
 
05:56:03.310 --> 05:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
of program like what kind of workload
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%

ideas that being said no I haven't had
 
05:56:20.670 --> 05:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to really think about
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
that thank

House Bill 7:15 FN
 
05:56:39.070 --> 05:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
and just give me uh one or two moments
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:05.160 --> 05:57:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
move

05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:35.120 --> 05:58:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.948 --> 05:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:59:02.310 --> 05:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:05.230 --> 05:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
decision uh first of all I usually do
 
05:59:06.468 --> 05:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
pretty good at scheduling but it looks
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
like I was a pretty aggressive this week
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at
 
05:59:13.070 --> 05:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
4:00 uh realistically that doesn't get
 
05:59:15.468 --> 05:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
some of us out here till
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
six um right now we only have six bills
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
left to hear that's not bad we're in
 
05:59:23.548 --> 05:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
pretty good shape it's only February
 
05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
17th uh we do have considerably more
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
than that to exec but our first deadline
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
is March 6 for early bills to report out
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
that have to go to a second committee so
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
this is what I think we're going to do
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have we're not going to
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
go into exec session today I'll say it
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
publicly I'm not open I'm not taking up
 
05:59:42.350 --> 05:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
any of these we're not going into
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
executive session I will reschedule
 
05:59:47.230 --> 05:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
these what we're going to do next week
 
05:59:49.350 --> 05:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
is hear the rest of our bills we have
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
six more to hear and we will exec at
 
05:59:56.110 --> 05:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
least the early bills maybe a few more
 
05:59:58.030 --> 05:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll go through the schedule we're
 
06:00:00.070 --> 06:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to take school vacation week
 
06:00:02.270 --> 06:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
off and then we're going to come back in
 
06:00:05.030 --> 06:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
the first week of March I think it is
 
06:00:05.040 --> 06:00:06.990 align:start position:0%
the first week of March I think it is
March

06:00:06.990 --> 06:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
March
 
06:00:10.910 --> 06:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
the fourth that Tuesday to clean up
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
everything that hasn't been exec yet
 
06:00:14.468 --> 06:00:14.478 align:start position:0%
that actually works pretty good because
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
I know there were a couple of bills that
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
people were looking at amendments a
 
06:00:18.990 --> 06:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that people were still
 
06:00:21.468 --> 06:00:21.478 align:start position:0%
trying to do a little bit more work on
 
06:00:23.230 --> 06:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
we've already pushed a couple of down
 
06:00:25.430 --> 06:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the road a little bit excuse sorry for
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
the transportation metaphor but I think
 
06:00:30.190 --> 06:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's a good plan and uh it doesn't
 
06:00:32.110 --> 06:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
beat us up tonight and we'll make all
 
06:00:35.788 --> 06:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
our deadlines so that's the rule and for
 
06:00:42.590 --> 06:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee next week and again I'm going
 
06:00:46.750 --> 06:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
to do the schedule but but we have six
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
more to hear so I I'll we'll hear those
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to go through my list one
 
06:00:52.070 --> 06:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
more time just to make sure I'm not
 
06:00:54.468 --> 06:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
missing any early bills I know we have
 
06:00:57.590 --> 06:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
at least three possibly four we will EXA
 
06:00:58.990 --> 06:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
those as well next
 
06:01:00.948 --> 06:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and then the balance of
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
executive session we'll have a nice long
 
06:01:05.788 --> 06:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
fourth of March and clean up everything
 
06:01:08.270 --> 06:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
the the committee waiting for
 
06:01:10.868 --> 06:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
crossover all right any other
