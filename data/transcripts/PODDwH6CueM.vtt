you may be aware that in 2018
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
our state passed a privacy amendment
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
to our state constitution and it shored
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
up the natural right of citizens to
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
have privacy in their
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
their information is one aspect of that
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
and over 80 percent of our population
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
entire state voting population voted for
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
that constitutional amendment
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
term of our legislature
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
there are several attempts to try to
 
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 align:start position:0%
shore up
 
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.710 align:start position:0%
shore up

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
that amendment in statute so you could
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
consider house bill 1401
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
to be part of that
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
effort what house bill 1401 does is it
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
adds the miles driven
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
in a motor vehicle
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
to that privacy protection
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
part of the intent of the bill
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
keep our citizens mileage data
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
within our within our state uh borders
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
and to not go
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
to the federal government
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that's the intent of the bill
 
00:07:59.720 --> 00:07:59.730 align:start position:0%
now why do that now
 
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
now why do that now

[Music]
 
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
[Music]
uh

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
the under the biden administration the
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the secretary of transportation uh
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
secretary butter judge
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
has discussed implementing a nationwide
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
mileage tax
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
which would be something brand new
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist before
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
that was floated uh
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
in the early part of last year
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the 1.2 trillion dollar
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
there's a pilot program that's buried in
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
that massive bill to to
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
to research the federal government doing
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
just that
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so this
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the federal government is floating a
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
trial balloon
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
and the intent of this bill is to pop
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
that balloon
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
in when it comes to the state of new
 
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:46.949 align:start position:0%
in when it comes to the state of new
hampshire

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
preserving our citizens privacy privacy
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the miles that they
 
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.190 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the miles that they
drive

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
drive
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is not to disrupt
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh the title process in our state
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's not to disrupt um
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
the trucking industry and any kind of
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
regulations that
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
surround that
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not to disrupt any business
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
models that might depend on mileage data
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
that that the state would uh oversee
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
so it's not to disrupt anything that
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's existing the intent is to
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
pop that trial balloon about a new
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
national mileage tax
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
i believe that the committee received an
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
email from the company carfax and we're
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
carfax they have a fox as a mascot
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
so that company reached out to me their
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
government relations
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
officer reached out to me and we worked
 
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.829 align:start position:0%
officer reached out to me and we worked
on

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
the language of that amendment
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
that would protect their business model
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
they rely on mileage data but they don't
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
they don't attach that mileage data to
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh an individual it's only to the vin
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
number of a vehicle is what i found out
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
and so uh you have that
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
that amendment in your inbox
 
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.069 align:start position:0%
that amendment in your inbox
now

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
the precedent of
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
a law being put in place that would
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
uh preempt a federal program
 
00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.389 align:start position:0%
uh preempt a federal program
uh

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
this is not a new precedent that that
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
precedent has been set on several
 
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.870 align:start position:0%
precedent has been set on several
occasions

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
with real id
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh years ago
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
the the transportation uh secretary has
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
also floated uh in he gave a press
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
release a few days ago
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
about having zero traffic deaths i don't
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
know if you heard that speech by him but
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
he would like to reach a goal of zero
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
traffic deaths one of the way that one
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
of the ways that they propose to do that
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
would be to implement a nationwide
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
camera system on on our nation's roads
 
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
camera system on on our nation's roads
so

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
it would be a camera system that would
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
track you know speed license plate all
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
those things and try to minimize
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
traffic deaths through such a program
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
that program under rsa 261 colon 110
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
is illegal currently in the state of new
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire by statute so that would be a
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
precedent where
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
our state has the ability to put laws in
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
place to prevent
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know a new program that might be
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
overreach into our state
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll take any questions
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative telersky
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
i understand your intent is to
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
stop this potential future federal
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
issue as you've explained but in my uh
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
handful of days subbing on public works
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee i've also understood the
 
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
committee i've also understood the
impact

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund and the
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
road toll and the ways we're going to
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
have to address
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
the funds to manage our roads in the
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
coming years with the higher efficiency
 
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
coming years with the higher efficiency
vehicles

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles etc and i know that
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
mileage is a very
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
important factor in that discussion
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't you believe that if this bill went
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
into law it would actually it would also
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
prevent the state from using that
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
information to address our revenue
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
concerns in terms of the road toll
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
so tolls
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
you're charged a toll when you pass a
 
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:32.949 align:start position:0%
you're charged a toll when you pass a
certain

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
location right
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
may clarify
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
sorry i i was gonna just okay sorry go
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
ahead so a toll is not based on mileage
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
of totals based on you passing a certain
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
point in physical space so
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
tolls will not be affected
 
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.150 align:start position:0%
tolls will not be affected
uh

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
i'll admit this bill is not in its final
 
00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
i'll admit this bill is not in its final
form

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
if the state would like to implement a
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
mileage tax to cover high efficiency
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles or electric vehicles
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
i would be open to amending this to make
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
to clarify that the state would be able
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
to do that but
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to do is expose our
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
citizens to a whole new
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
taxing scheme by the federal government
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
um one thing i did see on the back here
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that they can't disclose the mileage
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
without consent of the vehicle's owner
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any provision for some
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a form that
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
the owner would have to fill out to
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
disclose that information and i can see
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
that being a quagmire down the road
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
oh they didn't realize what they were
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
doing and now they don't want that
 
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.389 align:start position:0%
doing and now they don't want that
disclosed

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
disclosed
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good point
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps if the department's going
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
to speak after me they could address
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
that a lot of times
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're discouraged from putting the the
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
specific language of a form into statute
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
and to leave that to the rule-making
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
process so that would be you know my
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
best guess and answer to that okay thank
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative gorski thank you mr
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
the you mentioned the nationwide mileage
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
task if tax that
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner budojig was thinking about
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
putting in if that ever got into place
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
what is what would be that tax
 
00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
what is what would be that tax
well

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
well
it

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen the exact amount but
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
the amount that was floated early last
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
year was eight cents per mile so
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
so you could imagine
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
a couple different scenarios you go to
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
get your car inspected they record your
 
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.829 align:start position:0%
get your car inspected they record your
mileage

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
and the the government requires the
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
federal or the inspection station to
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
send that data to the federal government
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
they they difference year over year
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
multiply by eight cents
 
00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:52.470 align:start position:0%
multiply by eight cents
um

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
not not to get too far into the future
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
but a lot of these electric vehicles are
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet uh they have
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
location data that you know they even
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
have cameras all the way around if
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
you've ever driven in a tesla there's
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
cameras all around because they use
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
those cameras to
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know sense other vehicles and the
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
road conditions
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
um but the geolocation data
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
being streamed to the internet as you
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
drive would be another way in in the not
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
too distant future that that data could
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
be collected and and you could be
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
automatically taxed on it so we'd want
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
to you know think ahead and figure out
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
how we can
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
use our
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
authority as the legislature of a state
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
to maybe shield our citizens from
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
something coming in the future like that
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh next up
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh looks like
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
tell me if i'm pronouncing this wrong
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
priscilla van from the department of
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
safety department of motor vehicles
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
my name is priscilla vaughn i work for
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
the department of safety been there for
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
40 years
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
i work for the title and anti-theft
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
i feel like there's a lot of
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
holes in the bill it needs it really
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at because the way i
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
read it that the department of safety
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
can't record any mileage and we have a
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
lot of federal laws that we go through
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh the federal odometer tampering law
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
we also have
the

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
truth and mileage act
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
one of them has been around since 1972
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
the other has been around since 1986.
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is very important information to
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
transfer the owner has to transfer the
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
mileage on the back of the title
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
for every vehicle that they sell
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is also reported to the national
 
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.749 align:start position:0%
this is also reported to the national
system

00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
which is nimbitus and that is federally
 
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:02.629 align:start position:0%
which is nimbitus and that is federally
funded

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
or federally mandated by the feds
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned with the fact that
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
the wording states that we can't
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
transfer that information to the
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's very open
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's a federal
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
lots of federal laws out there that come
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
up to play
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
my big concern is the fact that
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
if my daughter or granddaughter is
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
buying a car
 
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.630 align:start position:0%
buying a car
and

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's an odometer statement that says
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
20 000 miles and they have bald tires
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
what does that tell you you should have
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
good tires on a vehicle if it has 20 000
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
miles on it should have original tires
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
so i look at it like
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
there could be odometer fraud when i
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
look through the odometer fraud statutes
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
online you can look online and see all
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
that there's 450 000 vehicles a year
 
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.630 align:start position:0%
that there's 450 000 vehicles a year
that

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
have been tampered with and that's a
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
billion dollar fraud industry and if you
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to increase i believe if we
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
don't keep track of the federal odometer
 
00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.150 align:start position:0%
don't keep track of the federal odometer
act

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's our duty to make sure that we have
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
safe vehicles on the road and
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
with that said this this bill definitely
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
needs some work because it there's a lot
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
of holes in my opinion it doesn't talk
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the fact that it would protect
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
the people who selling cars uh
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's the dealers
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies there's a lot of
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
people involved here there's a lot of
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that depend on that when
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
you buy a car
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
that value of that vehicle determines
 
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.310 align:start position:0%
that value of that vehicle determines
the

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
the mileage that's on the vehicle if you
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
see a vehicle that's 200 000 miles
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
you're not going to pay top dollar for
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
that vehicle if it has 20 000 miles
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know you're gonna pay top dollar so
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a lot to think about um
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
and that's the state's position does
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:18:57.919 --> 00:18:59.190 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
yes do we have any state data that
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the i mean those numbers
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
that you gave us were federal
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
numbers i assume
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
i have the federal government is the one
 
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.549 align:start position:0%
i have the federal government is the one
that

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
pursues those um and i don't have any
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
stats on hand of any any odometer fraud
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i could dig some up if i had to
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of cases i've done over
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
the 40 years i've worked with odometer
 
00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
the 40 years i've worked with odometer
fraud

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah just
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
with the chair's permission if we could
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
get that that would be helpful it would
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
be helpful whatever you can find okay no
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
problem uh representative o'hara thank
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
the information that you report right
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
now federally is it just the mileage and
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
the vin or do you associate a name with
 
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.830 align:start position:0%
the vin or do you associate a name with
it

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
so everything the state reports is by
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle that mileage follows the vehicle
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't follow a person so i could
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
buy your car and you need to disclose
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
that mileage so i can give you the fair
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
price for that vehicle uh that this
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
privacy is not really where this belongs
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
because privacy is your like your
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
driver's record your photograph your
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
social security
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
your personal information a vehicle's
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
mileage is not your personal information
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
that is the vehicle's description just
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
like any brands or flood damage or
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
anything to do with a vehicle that is
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
what that's all about
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um so if we were able to
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
make it an amendment to
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
not associate a person to the mileage
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much you're
 
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much you're
welcome

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
next up the chair recognizes
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
jim haydem
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
state farm
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee yes for the record my name is
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
jim haydem i'm here on behalf of state
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
farm insurance companies
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
state farm is the one of the nation's
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
largest and perhaps new hampshire's
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
largest right of automobile insurance
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
and for that reason they asked me to
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at this bill and frankly
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
hear what the testimony is beforehand
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
and comment on it and
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think i might be the only person
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the stakeholders
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill and i i thank the
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor for recognizing that
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
um there are business models that could
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
be disrupted by this bill and he and i
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate his intent not to try to
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
disrupt him
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to mention that state farm
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
is one of many stakeholders that feels
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
that this well state farm feels that
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would have
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
significant impact on
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
its practices
 
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
its practices
and

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the current law you know there's a
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
clear exception that allows
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to use this type of
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
information mileage in the context of
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
insurance and specifically fraud
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
activities rating and underwriting
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
and state farm uses this information to
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
try to make the interaction with its
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
customers more seamless
 
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:37.909 align:start position:0%
customers more seamless
by

00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
populating information and making
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
judgments on your renewal premiums and
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
things like that so that when you get
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
your bill to renew your policy every
 
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.310 align:start position:0%
your bill to renew your policy every
year

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
they can feel comfortable that it has
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
the most accurate information
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
behind that bill behind that premium
 
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
behind that bill behind that premium
request

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
and you know if to deny them this
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
information would require the customer
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
to provide the information themselves
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's a step this is an annoyance that
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
most customers don't like that's just
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
one one of the more practical
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
applications of this
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other is they use it in rating which
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
is their determination of what
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
premium should be charged for any
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
particular driver any particular vehicle
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
and this is not only true in relation to
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
the rating of the particular individuals
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
but when they try to get their rates
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
approved at the insurance department
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
they need to prove that they're sound
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
based on actuarial principles and
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
mileage relating to vehicles is one
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
factor that goes into many many factors
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
when they go in to get their rates
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
approved so again i thank
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor for recognizing
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.789 align:start position:0%
the sponsor for recognizing
that

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:52.630 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me that state farm and others
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
have legitimate interest in this
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
information and
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent this committee
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
would like to see this bill go forward
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate an opportunity to
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much question from the
 
00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:12.950 align:start position:0%
thank you very much question from the
committee

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's basically a follow-up to the last
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
question i just asked if we're able to
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
make the distinction between
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
the person and not the vehicle because
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming state farm uses the vin to
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
get the mileage not hurt the person's
 
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.430 align:start position:0%
get the mileage not hurt the person's
name

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
would stay farm be able to with that
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
disruptive business
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i was actually
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out my answer that
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
question when you asked it last and i
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a good answer for you but
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
i could certainly get it if you'd like
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
could you thank
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
you uh any other questions from the
 
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
you uh any other questions from the
committee

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is just more out
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
of curiosity um when you
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
just either approve someone's request
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
for insurance do you
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
not take in to account the driver the
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
person themselves and their driving
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
history and
 
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
history and
um

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
if they use their car regularly for work
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
or that kind of thing i guess i'm just
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
trying to see the tie between
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
you offering insurance to a driver and
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's innately tied to the
 
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.510 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's innately tied to the
person

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
well certainly the driver record is is
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
part of the determination of
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know the premium that would be
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
charged for for an insurance policy also
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
relevant is the car right and i think
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the mileage uh the mileage
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
comes in because you're trying to price
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
based upon the value of the car and
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
so rather than being associated with
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
the person i think it with
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
insurance it's more associated with the
 
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.230 align:start position:0%
insurance it's more associated with the
car

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much thank
 
00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:56.390 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much thank
you

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes jeff oberdenk from
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
jeff obernank and i'm here really today
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a position initially
 
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.710 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a position initially
um

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't really sure where the bill was
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
headed or what it was about until we
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
heard the introduction
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
a little while ago
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we want to be
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
aware of is that there are instances in
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
which we use mileage
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
for several different programs that we
 
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.909 align:start position:0%
for several different programs that we
have

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
and one of those such things is the low
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
mileage waiver
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
for somebody who passes the safety
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
inspection but fails
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
the obd inspection and drives less than
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
we collect that mileage in order to
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
determine if they're eligible for that
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
program or not
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
so there is a program out there that we
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
are using the mileage for
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
there's also one of the things that we
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
when we reached out to our vendor gordon
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
darby with regard to the inspection
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
process and why they
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
would grab and track mileage one of
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
those is relative to almost every brand
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
new vehicle
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
anything less than a thousand miles on
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
it will probably not pass obd for the
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
simple reason that the sensors haven't
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
been used enough
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
so they're tracking the reason why that
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
they're passing
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
a vehicle through the service
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
without it getting a passing grade so
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
for instance if i buy a car off the lot
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's got 100 miles on it
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
the oxygen sensors aren't going to tell
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
me whether it's running well or not
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't run long enough
 
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't run long enough
so

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not yet another reason why we track
 
00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:40.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not yet another reason why we track
mileage

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
and also mechanics use the mileage
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
during the inspection process as well
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
to let a customer know that there may be
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
a potential issue before the next
 
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.389 align:start position:0%
a potential issue before the next
inspection

00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
inspection
or

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
so for instance you you roll in that the
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
car's got 32 000 miles on it and the you
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
know the inspection mechanic would note
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
that before you get to 35 or 36 000
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
miles you're probably going to need
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
brakes or exhaust or tires or those
 
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.110 align:start position:0%
brakes or exhaust or tires or those
things

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
so not understanding what the bill was
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
for we went back and we looked at all of
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
the areas in which we would track
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
mileage for the inspection process and
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
we think we have some valid reasons for
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
having mileage
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
having said that i'll take any questions
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
the committee may have
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.750 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
the obd system that's been in place
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
since 96
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great question i think
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
it has and um
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
so we've been collecting this
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
information since 1996.
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
have we had any
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
issues with privacy or that you're aware
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
of nothing that i'm aware of in that
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
material to be fair nothing that i'm
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
aware of i i assume the post and
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
overseeing the inspection program
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
in september of 2020 so um
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
past 15 18 months i have not seen
 
00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.549 align:start position:0%
past 15 18 months i have not seen
anything

00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and thank you

representative for taking my question
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.310 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
whether

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
um because this would be tracked by the
 
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.389 align:start position:0%
um because this would be tracked by the
vehicle

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
would how would it work with um with
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
someone that uh
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
that leases or
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
probably more importantly rents vehicles
 
00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.269 align:start position:0%
probably more importantly rents vehicles
presumably

00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
there would be a charge that would come
 
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.310 align:start position:0%
there would be a charge that would come
through

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
attached to the rental
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
of a vehicle that you would
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
be paying for that portion of the of the
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
mileage driven is that is that how you
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate that working
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question um i was
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
thinking mainly of uh
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
you know people that primarily are
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
owners of the vehicle
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh i i'll have to think about that if
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
you have ideas i'd love to
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
sorry about that no no that's why we go

relative to the definition of conviction
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
in title 21 or our motor vehicle laws
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
i think they can do a much better job
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
explaining this one
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%

department i believe they're already
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%

good morning members of the committee
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%

brittany from the division of motor
vehicles

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is at the request of the
 
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
this bill is at the request of the
department

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
it broadens the definition for a
 
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
it broadens the definition for a
conviction

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
currently the way the law is written
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's very specific to
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle statutes and the
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
definitions of convictions
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
do not really have
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're not defined for regular
 
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.870 align:start position:0%
they're not defined for regular
operators

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
operators
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is in the interest of public safety
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
so we can have better comprehensive more
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
concise records by being able to
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect the information that
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
is received both
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
in-state and from out-of-state
 
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.630 align:start position:0%
in-state and from out-of-state
jurisdictions

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
with that i'll be happy to take any
 
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
with that i'll be happy to take any
questions

goshen langdon webster and washington
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh this bill i discovered when
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
researching another issue for someone
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
and was shocked shocked to find that the
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
state police can pull me over
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
order me to go to portable scale
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere and weigh my car
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
i've driven over a million miles uh ten
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
years ago i stopped keeping track
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i've never had police in any state
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
including new hampshire where i drive
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
five six hundred miles a week asked me
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
to go have my car weighed so it seemed
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
like an opportunity to get rid of an
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
obsolete law
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh commercial vehicles still have to
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
pull into the stops but if i have gone
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
to home depot and put a bunch of two by
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
fours in the back of my station wagon i
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to the rest uh to the
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
way station and that's all the bill does
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%

00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
the statute had some pretty old
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
notations on it if i had to guess um
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
it was just generic language that was
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
put in when we decided that trucks
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
needed to be weighed so why not just say
 
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.470 align:start position:0%
needed to be weighed so why not just say
vehicles

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
and and really
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
if i've been pulled over and the
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
officer's concern is wait
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'll bet you there's a bunch of other
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
things he can cite me for
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up um
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
that brings up uh the question so what
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
what presumably happens if you are
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
pulled over and they do weigh your car
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
what are there a list of
 
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.790 align:start position:0%
what are there a list of
of

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
charges that can come from that weight
 
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.829 align:start position:0%
charges that can come from that weight
or

00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:48.630 align:start position:0%
or
i

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's possible if there's
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
overweight i think any vehicle being
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
overweight is probably a violation
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
but um
when

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
you go down to home depot and pick up
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
some five gallon pails of driveway
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
steeler or whatever do you weigh the
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
occupants of the vehicle and each bucket
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
that you put in the back no nobody does
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
that and getting pulled over for it is
 
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:13.109 align:start position:0%
that and getting pulled over for it is
dumb

00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
dumb
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
just one question for me so if this were
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm assuming that the guy who has a
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
f-150 and puts two pallets of shingles
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the back of it wouldn't be able to be
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
weighed either
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
two pallets of um well no they can't
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
order them with scales and i mean are
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
they doing that now yeah i don't know
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
that there are generic unsafe load
 
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.750 align:start position:0%
that there are generic unsafe load
charges

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
charges
okay

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative fenton uh thank you for
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question there's a fiscal note
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
attached to this it looks like do you
 
00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.550 align:start position:0%
attached to this it looks like do you
know

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
for it says less than ten thousand
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
dollars so it seems like a
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
straight yeah that's the generic one
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
they put on when yeah i don't know maybe
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have to change some forms but there's
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
nothing significant thank you
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
i i i'd like to be interested to know
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
who else might be sitting to speak on
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
where i would ask my question
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
the only one i have left is new
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police okay fine
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
you're good okay who will be far better
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
authorities than i
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
so seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes carl huddleston
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire state police in
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair and members of the committee
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state of new hampshire
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:00.550 align:start position:0%
department of safety
i

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
am in opposition of this
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
i listen to the testimony just given and
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
i understand and maybe
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
not understanding how we do things
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
this may have come about
 
00:47:14.319 --> 00:47:16.150 align:start position:0%
this may have come about
however

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to just waving somebody in
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
really reserved for commercial vehicles
 
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.750 align:start position:0%
really reserved for commercial vehicles
only

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
why i'm in opposition of this is the
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
question somebody um posed about the two
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
pallets of shingles in an f-150
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
there have been some occasions and i
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
have personally seen this and
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
stopped somebody who has taken an f-150
 
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
stopped somebody who has taken an f-150
f-250

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
f-250
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
personally owned vehicle and loaded it
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
to the point where it was
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
very unsafe
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
and it becomes an issue of public safety
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
so typically
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
unless we
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
have probable cause to believe
 
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.710 align:start position:0%
have probable cause to believe
something

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
a vehicle is overweight that's a
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle not a commercial motor
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle outside of probable cause we
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
typically do not pull in
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
a non-commercial vehicle
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
without cause
 
00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:17.829 align:start position:0%
without cause
and

00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
the notation on here of the financial
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
impact being less than ten thousand
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
dollars i'm the one that actually did
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
the financial impact statement on this
 
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.829 align:start position:0%
the financial impact statement on this
and

00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
the three years
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
that i looked back
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
there had been
 
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.030 align:start position:0%
there had been
um

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
only a handful of these cases in the
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
last five years i think there were six
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the last five years that we actually
 
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.950 align:start position:0%
in the last five years that we actually
identified

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
a non-commercial vehicle as being
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
overweight the new hampshire statute of
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
266 colon 26
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
states that
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
the vehicle has to be more than 20
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
percent overweight in order for us to
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
take any enforcement action against it
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
so basically a vehicle that was rated
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
for ten thousand pounds would have to be
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
over twelve thousand before we actually
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
were able to write a ticket to it um
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when we uh identify a
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
privately owned vehicle a non-commercial
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
overweight it's most of the time it's an
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
educational experience for the operator
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
and for the trooper more than an
 
00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:27.190 align:start position:0%
and for the trooper more than an
enforcement

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
type of scenario
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to promote safety uh yes
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
there are some instances where there is
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
a citation issued for this
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
but most of the time
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's the guy on saturday morning trying
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
to patch his driveway or
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
he's got two pallets of wood pellets in
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
the back of this truck and it's headed
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
down the road this way
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
so it becomes a public safety issue
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
more than anything else you're
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
loading a vehicle well beyond its
 
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:55.670 align:start position:0%
loading a vehicle well beyond its
capacity

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to adding the language of
 
00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:01.349 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to adding the language of
only

00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles to being able to be
 
00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:04.870 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles to being able to be
weighed

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
weighed
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you sergeant
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
oh actually it's a request that you
 
00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.670 align:start position:0%
oh actually it's a request that you
would

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
elaborate more fully on the pa the uh
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
the public safety concerns that you have
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to tell us that the
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle is overweight okay but what does
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
that really mean or what are the impacts
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
of that for public safety
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question um the
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
first thing that i would want to talk
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
about is the braking ability of a
 
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
about is the braking ability of a
vehicle

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
loading vehicle 20 percent beyond its
 
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.630 align:start position:0%
loading vehicle 20 percent beyond its
intended

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
gross vehicle weight rating
 
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.829 align:start position:0%
gross vehicle weight rating
significantly

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
reduces the braking ability of the
 
00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:51.270 align:start position:0%
reduces the braking ability of the
vehicle

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
the steering also becomes less effective
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
if the vehicle is
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
overloaded towards the back of the
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle like i said somebody riding down
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
the road
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
with the vehicle pointing upwards rather
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
than level takes weight off the the
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
front axle
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
making it harder to steer
 
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.109 align:start position:0%
making it harder to steer
again

00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
being able to stop
 
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.750 align:start position:0%
being able to stop
and

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
being able to control the vehicle once
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is is overloaded
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
they tend to wander on the road i think
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
everybody probably has seen a trailer
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
behind somebody's car at some point or
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
truck swaying in
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
behind the vehicle that's an indication
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
also that that uh trailer might be
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
overweight so
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
braking and steering are the two most
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
important things and obviously it could
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
certainly damage the vehicle to the
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
point where uh would blow a tire or
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
something like that as well so
 
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.829 align:start position:0%
something like that as well so
um

00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
a tire that's overloaded uh heats up
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
um as the heat increases in the tire the
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
pressure increases and if it increases
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
enough it will actually blow the tire so
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that at
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
least three that i've just mentioned
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
that are part of the safety aspect of
 
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.270 align:start position:0%
that are part of the safety aspect of
that

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
i've got one if you don't mind we'll get
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
to in a minute
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
just for clarification getting back to
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
that f-150 with the two pallets of
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
shingles um
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
you said that it was probable cause if
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
you noticed it going down the street
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the rear bumper dragging but if you
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
were to pull them over for that overload
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
situation or suspected
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
would you make them drive five ten miles
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
to the nearest scales to actually get
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
weighed no we would um and i've done
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
this before myself so i can speak to
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
this we would get them
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
either to a wide part of the road or to
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
a driveway somewhere to to take a look
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
at the vehicle
 
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.910 align:start position:0%
at the vehicle
the

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
the 10 mile portion of this
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
mainly is for commercial vehicles
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
most of our troopers now that do truck
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement we carry portable scales
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
with us so we're typically not dry
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
having somebody drive that
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
that far that's a valid point
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
moving something that you suspect is
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
significantly overweight even further um
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
that is a valid point and we would try
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
to get the vehicle again even on the
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
shoulder wide shoulder of the road to
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it's actually
 
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.589 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it's actually
overweight

00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
overweight
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'hara
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you taking
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
is there another citation you could pull
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
them over for to give them this
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
education and then penalize them for if
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
they do not learn from the education
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
rather than forcing them to go to a
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes and no
 
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.510 align:start position:0%
yes and no
specifically

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
no as far as weight goes
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's a statute for
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
the weight statutes in 266 18 address
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
cross vehicle weight
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
mainly for larger trucks but also talks
 
00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:52.790 align:start position:0%
mainly for larger trucks but also talks
about

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
tire capacity
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
however you would still need to weigh
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
the vehicle to determine if the vehicle
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
was beyond the tire capacity of the
 
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.710 align:start position:0%
was beyond the tire capacity of the
vehicle

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
um but again this is something that we
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
don't do very often as i said before i
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
think it's been a half a dozen times in
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.670 align:start position:0%
five years
and

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.710 align:start position:0%
and
again

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
we're able to stop a commercial vehicle
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
without probable cause
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
we would only stop a non-commercial or a
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
privately owned vehicle
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
had probable cause to believe that the
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle was overweight or there was a
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative gorski
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it's kind of
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
doug-tailing what the chairman asked
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
about the shingles and the f-150 and you
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned pulling the car over
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
if you kind of have a conversation with
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
the driver and you mentioned sometimes
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's an educational issue yes
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
if you're pulling them off to the side
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
and you've determined this is overloaded
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
what happens at that point do you
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
like have the drive behind the person to
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
get their destination or does the car
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
have to sit there what kind of happens
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
afterwards so uh great question thank
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
you um a lot of times we'll try to
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
get the the driver or the owner to make
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
an arrangement to have somebody else
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
come over with another truck to offload
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
it a little bit
 
00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.789 align:start position:0%
it a little bit
or

00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
or
if

00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
they're in a
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
place where
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
there happens to be a
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
either a town or a state owned facility
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
they could unload part of the load there
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
but yes um even on the commercial side
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
of things um we would
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
make them unload
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
um to get to the point where it was safe
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
to drive again but
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of times
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
people have to unload a portion of what
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're carrying
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative talerski
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question you brought up the
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
issue of a trailer and overloaded
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
trailer and i'm curious if this
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
clarification was made in the statute if
 
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
it would prevent you from addressing a
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's pulling what appears to
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
be an overloaded trailer
 
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.589 align:start position:0%
be an overloaded trailer
my

00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this would be to
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate our ability to stop anything
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a commercial vehicle any
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:29.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else
representative

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
oh that's right rambo i'm sorry
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you clarified that
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
the commercial vehicles do not need
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
probable cause correct but for the
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicles to do so in
 
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.390 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicles to do so in
those

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
six instances or so in the last five
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
years that you're recalling
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
the officer had to make the
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
determination you know probable cause it
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
was over 20 overloaded correct yes so
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
that framework is always in place for
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
the non-commercial yes
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
we would not do this randomly uh
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
any if many of you have probably gone by
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
either the windham scales are gone by
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
the canterbury rest area or we've got
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
the signs out to say all trucks uh enter
 
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.789 align:start position:0%
the signs out to say all trucks uh enter
um

00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's how we screen uh commercial
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles for
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
other violations other than weight but
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's typically
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
we watch a vehicle come in we run them
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
over a set of scales and determine
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're overweight
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
we typically do not do that with
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles um
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
again this is something that doesn't
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
happen very often however we we have to
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
have probable cause to to stop the
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicle and
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
based on you know a trooper or an
 
00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:41.270 align:start position:0%
based on you know a trooper or an
officer's

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
officer's
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience they would make
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
a call and say hey that looks like it's
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
overloaded um we would then stop it and
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative sykes
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you sergeant
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:57.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you sergeant
um

00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
could you just help me out a little bit
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
about this probable cause business
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to me whether
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
it is a policy of the department to not
 
00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:10.470 align:start position:0%
it is a policy of the department to not
stop

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
private vehicles unless you have
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause or whether it is a
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
an rsa or something like that or a rule
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
that differentiates for probable cause
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
reasons for commercial and private
 
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.190 align:start position:0%
reasons for commercial and private
vehicles

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.270 align:start position:0%
okay um
so

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
so
is

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'll talk about commercial for just a
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
second commercial vehicles
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
we don't need probable cost to stop them
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
as long as
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the officer trooper is certified we're
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
certified by the federal murder carious
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
administration to do
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle inspections
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules and law
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
allow us to stop
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
a commercial vehicle or one that appears
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be in commerce without probable cause
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
to do an inspection we
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
the vehicle the load the driver
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
qualifications and things like that
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's the commercial side
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
in order for us to stop a vehicle any
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle whether it be for speed an
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker or anything like that
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
we need reasonable suspicion to believe
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
either a crime has committed or there is
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
a violation of state law so it's more
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
than just a hey i want to stop a car it
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
a that vehicle looks like it potentially
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
is overweight or unsafe that's the
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
determined that would be our reasonable
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion or probable cause
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
to believe that the vehicle is
 
00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.430 align:start position:0%
to believe that the vehicle is
overweight

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.630 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
i have nobody else signed up to speak on
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
this if there's anybody else that wishes
 
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.349 align:start position:0%
this if there's anybody else that wishes
to

00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
now's the time
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
seeing that i'm going to close the
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee i remain representative
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
stephen smith sullivan county district
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
act where charlestown goes from land to
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
if you've been
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
i always do it alphabetical i don't like
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
to show favoritism if um if you've been
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
on the committee for a while you'll
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
recall when we had the brutal fight to
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
get the new version of the hands-free
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
law passed
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we did that was
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
because the old one was not working
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
we had a previous distracted driving law
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we never know what happens once we
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
pass the law how it's going to be
 
01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
pass the law how it's going to be
implemented

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
hey look at that
 
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:33.589 align:start position:0%
hey look at that
thanks

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
gonna make me lose my groove
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
so what we've we found afterwards was
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't drive while you're
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
distracted and as i mentioned earlier
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
the miles that i drive you see some
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
things i've seen people with newspapers
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
spread out across their steering wheel
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
clearly distracted right okay can you
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
get cited for that absolutely are you
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
gonna get convicted no because here's
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
what was happening the court was
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
applying a subsequent act standard
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
so you can be distracted and clearly so
 
01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
so you can be distracted and clearly so
um

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
have that newspaper out but until you
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
hit me
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
you weren't distracted that's how they
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
were proving distraction you do
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
something wrong so if you're managing to
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
stay in your lane while you're doing
 
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.750 align:start position:0%
stay in your lane while you're doing
that

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
up until the very moment that you wreck
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
me and kill my family you're not
 
01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.670 align:start position:0%
me and kill my family you're not
distracted

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
distracted
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why we passed the new version
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what got by us when we did
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
that was we didn't repeal the old one
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
we have a new better one
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is the old one it's a straight up
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
repeal the new one's working we don't
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
need this and that's why the bill was
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's all i have mr chair thank you
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative talarsky
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative smith
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
um i'm noticing a line that is the
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle
 
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.589 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicle
section

01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
um line three
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
is that also simply repealing the
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
distracted driving line for commercial
 
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.470 align:start position:0%
distracted driving line for commercial
drivers

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
yeah supposed to reference the new
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
statute oh referencing the new statute
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you i just want to
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
sorry can i do a follow-up absolutely as
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
we don't so line three redirects to
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
26579 we don't need to do anything once
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
we repeal the other one because two six
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
five seven nine's already in place
 
01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
five seven nine's already in place
just

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be that's the intent i
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
don't know the statute sitting in front
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
of me but that is all the bills supposed
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
to do okay
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure we'll double check it
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
before we yes please thank you
 
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.589 align:start position:0%
before we yes please thank you

01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and we'll take
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%

01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:43.029 align:start position:0%

01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
i knew if held out long enough i'd get
 
01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:45.829 align:start position:0%
i knew if held out long enough i'd get
one

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
oh it's a different one

representative from the town of hooksett
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to introduce
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
my last bill before transportation and
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully the simplest one we have this
 
01:21:42.639 --> 01:21:43.669 align:start position:0%
hopefully the simplest one we have this
year

01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's 1534 authorizing the site uh use
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
of side exhaust for antique vehicles
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
side exhausts
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
you may be you may remember them from
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
the 60s and 70s
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
corvettes came with them from the
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
factory side pipes
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh in those same model years 50s 60s and
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
70s a lot of people used to run these
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
their tail pipes just out of the vehicle
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
before the rear wheel which is no longer
 
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.550 align:start position:0%
before the rear wheel which is no longer
legal

01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
for many different reasons usually it's
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
because there's no room behind the rear
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
wheels to run your custom dual exhaust
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's the tub for the spare tire
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
or the fuel tank
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so if you want to run these exhausts
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
um you have to hang them down two three
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
inches and they're absolutely awful this
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
has been a pet peeve of mine for a while
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh if you can have them legally on some
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles why can't you have them on
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
other vehicles these it's going to be a
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
very limited number we're looking at the
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
antiques what i had ols do was just look
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
custom vehicle statute and the hot rod
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
statute and match it
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
so and they're allowed in those vehicles
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
i will admit
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
i did get a recommendation from the
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles to make one
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
change by amendment
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at re uh line five
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
discharge point to the rear edge i mean
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
to the rear of the rear edge of the
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
front door
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
and such system shall direct exhaust gas
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
away from the vehicle i am going to get
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment for it uh to the rear edge
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the rear most door or something along
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
just in case somebody with a four door
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
opts to run this type of exhaust and i
 
01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.629 align:start position:0%
opts to run this type of exhaust and i
don't

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
foresee much of that but i'll make the
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
change i don't see an issue
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
again this isn't just for vanity uh it's
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
because in some of these old a-bodies
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
and g-bodies there's just no other way
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
and people still like customizing their
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles doesn't change anything for
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
decibels or mufflers or anything else
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's required it's just a discharge
 
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
that's required it's just a discharge
point

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all this bill does
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
again hopefully it's the most the
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
simplest bill we have we'll see if
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
anybody behind me contradicts that
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative rambo
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for taking my
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
question and this again maybe a newbie
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
question when you refer to the custom uh
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
language you clarified with the hot rod
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the custom vehicles when it says
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
antique in here is that used when it
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
says antique in the bill that uses a
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
term of art that would reference back
 
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.510 align:start position:0%
term of art that would reference back
to

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
a certain framework of what constitutes
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
an antique vehicle yeah i don't have the
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
statute while the statute 266
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
you'd have to look if you if you look
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
into our statutes in the 266
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
there's three separations you've got the
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
antique vehicle by definition hot rods
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
by definition and
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
custom vehicles so in those bottom two
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's already legal to do this i just
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
include it in the antique vehicles as
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you for clarifying that
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly on that i i see it as a very
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
small amount of vehicles because quite
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
honestly the newer vehicles beyond that
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
there's just no reason for people to do
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
it on front-wheel drive vehicles that
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's a style thing for those types of
 
01:24:52.639 --> 01:24:53.830 align:start position:0%
it's a style thing for those types of
cars

01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
cars
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions from yes
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative manji booty
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm substituting for
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
my colleague here um justin a question
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
about carbon monoxide building is the
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
exhaust being
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
beyond the back door
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
that would help from not having any
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to the rare yeah that was the
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
concern of the department
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it's an oversight i guess most of
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
the custom vehicles and hot rods don't
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
have four doors but obviously some
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
antiques do so if we just change the
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
language to make sure the pipe is beyond
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
basically the the interior compartment
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
it relieves their concerns
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative fenton
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i'm
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
a hot rod enthusiast as well
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
my question was just to make sure it
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
adheres to that of the other law you're
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
speaking about um
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
side exhaust can get quite loud is there
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
a decibel level that
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
needs to maintain or does antique
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles perhaps not
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
need to adhere to that decimal level no
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
they nothing is going to change the
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
decibel level now i don't have that in
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
front of me but there's no intention of
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
this to change anything for sound
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're still going to be required to
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
have the mufflers that they are now
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know catalytic converters etc etc it
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
merely is just a discharge point
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
and again for the main reason i've got
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
for example a 79 malibu
 
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:25.910 align:start position:0%
for example a 79 malibu
um

01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
in any of those styles if you wanted to
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
run dual exhaust
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's no place to put them out back
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
and the only place it really fits
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
without seeing it is before the front
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
wheels not to mention it's also cool but
 
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.470 align:start position:0%
wheels not to mention it's also cool but
besides

01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's nice to split up the sound of eight
 
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.350 align:start position:0%
it's nice to split up the sound of eight
cylinders

01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
next up
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now okay uh i
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative walsh actually took my
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
talking point so i was just going to add
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
that the state police would be in
 
01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
that the state police would be in
support

01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill with that added language of
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
just the rear part of the rear most
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
passenger door that was all
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify who
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out a card
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
i will close
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing on
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
being 11 10 we're going to open up the
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill 1447
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
prohibiting state agencies from using
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
face recognition technology
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative mcguire
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%

01:40:48.159 --> 01:40:49.590 align:start position:0%
house bill 1447
is

01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
about half of a bill that passed the
 
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
house i think three times already
 
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
house i think three times already
it

01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
it deals
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
bans the use of face recognition
 
01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.229 align:start position:0%
bans the use of face recognition
technology

01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:41:02.239 --> 01:41:03.669 align:start position:0%
technology
by

01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
state agencies it does not address the
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
what's allowable in courts or
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
for presenting evidence
 
01:41:14.239 --> 01:41:15.350 align:start position:0%
for presenting evidence
because

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
there were at least three groups of
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers who had different strongly
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
different positions on that and that has
 
01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.390 align:start position:0%
different positions on that and that has
killed

01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
killed
 
01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.350 align:start position:0%
killed
other

01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
face recognition bills that we've had in
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
this simply says that the driver's
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
license database which contains a
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
picture of
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
a good portion of the people of new
 
01:41:34.719 --> 01:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
a good portion of the people of new
hampshire

01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
shall not be used for face recognition
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
and it also means that the
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
other agencies shall not create or
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
maintain a searchable database of faces
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
they can still create and use
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
the facial databases that they have now
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
where they for example type in the name
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
and say yes this here's a picture of
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
warren davis i'm looking at this person
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
and he's the one that is authorized to
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
come pick up a child at this visitation
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
center or here's a picture of
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
john williams he's
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
he is in fact a state employee and he's
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
authorized to enter this building
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
something like that is not a problem
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh what we don't want is to have the
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
agencies receiving pictures of people
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
trying to compare them to their database
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's open to
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of false positives particularly
 
01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.310 align:start position:0%
a lot of false positives particularly
for

01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
the elderly
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
women and non-whites
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
so it's somewhat discriminatory
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it also is a
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
of one's privacy
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
you might be interested to know that the
 
01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
you might be interested to know that the
irs

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
irs
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
just this
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
just this morning i saw on the wall
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
street journal they are no longer going
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be using face of recognition
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
to establish one's identity because it's
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
too easy to game and it's
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
again difficult to
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
and it's discriminatory in which faces
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
it recognizes it's really good at you
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
know 30 year old technologists in
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
silicon valley but it's not so good in
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
facial recognition and this merely
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
protects the state
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
photo databases
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
from that use and i'll answer any
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
questions i can
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative if any
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
was it representative hill
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
oh representative thompson i'm sorry
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
i do have one um how about easy pass
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
where where are you with that
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question i don't
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
know don't know that they had one is
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
that's not a state agency so it
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be affected by the bill
 
01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be affected by the bill
so

01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
are you implying that easy pass
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
scans not only your your driver's
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that is the case and and i
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
because ezpass is multi-state
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that would be
 
01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that would be
shared

01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
within that
 
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.669 align:start position:0%
within that
that

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:35.679 --> 01:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
that
product

01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.430 align:start position:0%
product
that's

01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would not be affected by the bill
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
as i read it
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
also it encourages
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
i want to encourage everyone everyone to
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
wear dark glasses and a hat while you're
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
going through the tolls
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
that'll confuse a fake a
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't forget the groucho marx glasses
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
as i read the
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
lines 9 10 and 11
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
it says that uh
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
you may not use
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
viewing of a represent
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
representation of an individual on a
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
computer video recording
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
photograph or other media
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
if we're not supposed to use a
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
photograph to identify people sir that's
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
the exemption
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
that face recognition technology does
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
not include using a photograph to
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me my committee's meeting so i
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
i just looked at 263 40-b and it's
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward the department is
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited from using
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
any facial recognition technology in
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
connection with taking or retaining
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
any photograph or digital image for
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
stop full stop
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what what you're
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish it's already
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative for finding that out i
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
may not have done my my research as
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
thorough as i should have if that is in
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
fact the case then that covers my
 
01:46:48.159 --> 01:46:49.910 align:start position:0%
fact the case then that covers my
concerns

01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
i do want to i did want to ban other
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
agencies from using facial recognition
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
so if if it needs to be trimmed to just
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
the line the sentence starting on page
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
five about
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
the state agency other state agencies
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
shall not do so i would be perfectly
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%

around the table and i won't read it but
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'll just
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
make a couple of statements from it the
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
chiefs are concerned this would prohibit
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire from using
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
technology that would be helpful in
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
solving crimes crimes with victims and a
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
cost to society
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
in a state of limited resources which
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
includes law enforcement the ban on the
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
use of this technology further inhibits
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law enforcement from being
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
able to help solve serious crimes that
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
have real victims in an efficient
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
effective and most importantly a timely
 
01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.390 align:start position:0%
effective and most importantly a timely
manner

01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
it is important to recognize new
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire law enforcement expects to use
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
this technology only under close
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
judicial scrutiny and would not use
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
these tools as a sole and only mechanism
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
to charge subjects with a crime
 
01:48:56.159 --> 01:48:57.510 align:start position:0%
to charge subjects with a crime
um

01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'll wrap it up there and in
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion the chiefs respectfully ask
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
that you find this bill and expedient to
 
01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.910 align:start position:0%

some written testimony also emailed it
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
to the committee because there are some
 
01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
to the committee because there are some
links

01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
links
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
in some of the footnotes that might
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide some information that i thought
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
you could just click on
 
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:48.530 align:start position:0%
so i provided it electronically too
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:49.589 align:start position:0%
so i provided it electronically too
[Music]

01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
so we have concerns with
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
the bill it basically just bans
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
the outright use of
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
valuable uses
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the technology i mean with any
 
01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.070 align:start position:0%
of the technology i mean with any
technology

01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are uh valuable uses but if used
 
01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.470 align:start position:0%
there are uh valuable uses but if used
wrong

01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.070 align:start position:0%
wrong
um

01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know some bad it's bad but um
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
there are valuable uses of this
 
01:51:21.199 --> 01:51:22.470 align:start position:0%
there are valuable uses of this
technology

01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.669 align:start position:0%
technology
um

01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the industry actually has put
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
together a bunch of principles
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
that should guide the use of this
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
technology including transparency
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
it should be transparent
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh when this technology is used
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh data privacy
 
01:51:39.679 --> 01:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
uh data privacy
um

01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
human oversight
 
01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
human oversight
uh

01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
so in looking at the use of technology
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
we think that it's more advisable to
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
look at ways to maybe
 
01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:56.870 align:start position:0%
look at ways to maybe
put

01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
bounds around it rather than to ban it
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
all together
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
it is often used uh with human
 
01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
it is often used uh with human
trafficking

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.870 align:start position:0%
trafficking
um

01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
especially with children
 
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
especially with children
um

01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
it is uh used in a number of uh crime
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh investigations
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
and typically
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
the use of facial recognition technology
 
01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.990 align:start position:0%
the use of facial recognition technology
and

01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
the results of it are not
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
the sole thing
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
that is brought to a court
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
for a conviction
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
it typically is used as a lead
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
to say here's a match here
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
let's go get some more evidence and find
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
out if this is the individual that we're
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.669 align:start position:0%
looking for
um

01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
that has been done that that's been
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
that that process has been used by law
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement even before the technology
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
except it's been a hand process it's
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
been a much slower process and trying to
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
match photos
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
this basically just speeds it up
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
is what it does
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh but again it is
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
not used as the sole thing that can
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
convict someone it's it's used as a tool
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
oftentimes just hedging the right
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
direction there have been some other
 
01:53:09.679 --> 01:53:10.950 align:start position:0%
direction there have been some other
states

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
that have banned the use of it and have
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
reversed it because
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
they realized there were some
 
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:19.350 align:start position:0%
they realized there were some
applications

01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
where it was useful
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
and so we would just caution this
 
01:53:23.679 --> 01:53:24.870 align:start position:0%
and so we would just caution this
committee

01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.589 align:start position:0%
committee
to

01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
move slowly
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
in this direction
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh maybe sending the bill to interim
 
01:53:30.639 --> 01:53:32.629 align:start position:0%
uh maybe sending the bill to interim
study

01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the industry i'd be happy
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
at some point later this session or the
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
interim study period to get uh officials
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
and uh people in the organization and
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
with the companies to come come in and
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
explain a little more in its use
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
but we just feel throwing it out all
 
01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:52.310 align:start position:0%
but we just feel throwing it out all
together

01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh is not a wise thing to do because
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of benefits that this
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
stuff can bring
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
again put some boundaries around it
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably worthwhile set
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
some policy
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
principles in the statute maybe that
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
could provide guidance on its use uh but
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
all together banning uh just doesn't
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
seem the right thing to do and i'd be
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'hara
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you have those
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
policies written down somewhere by any
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
chance i do and actually it's one of the
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks in the uh
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
letter that i emailed you uh it's one of
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
the it's the first footnote and those
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative hill thank you mr
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.790 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
as i understand it this isn't an
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
outright ban this is only suggesting
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
that um the technology be used within
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
a single department not shared amongst
 
01:54:55.679 --> 01:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
a single department not shared amongst
departments

01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
departments
um

01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
is that not your understanding as well
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
and and would that be an issue for your
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
association what makes it problematic if
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the first sentence of the
 
01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.589 align:start position:0%
you look at the first sentence of the
bill

01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
it says the department shall not allow
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
access to any of its digital
 
01:55:15.199 --> 01:55:16.790 align:start position:0%
access to any of its digital
representations

01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
representations
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
of faces by any face recognition
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
technology nor shall the department use
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
face recognition technology so for
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement outside of the state
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
that wants outside of
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
the local law enforcement wanting to
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
match up a face with um
 
01:55:37.119 --> 01:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
match up a face with um
a

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:38.870 align:start position:0%
a
a

01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
digital representation of a face
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
that the state has
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited by this and that's
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's the large database that law
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement use
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh to try to match up a face that
 
01:55:53.669 --> 01:55:53.679 align:start position:0%
actually has the information about a
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
person that could provide a lead so
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's where it becomes problematic it
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
sort of indirectly
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
shuts it all down
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%

manjuputi
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:56:11.199 --> 01:56:12.629 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
the surveillance uh cameras
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
in private sector or in say the corner
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
grocery store and stuff
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
that data is used as an initial
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
screening correct with the local lion
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement if there's a break break in
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
or something so that's more of
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
facial recognition in the video would
 
01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.629 align:start position:0%
facial recognition in the video would
that

01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:39.350 align:start position:0%
that
be

01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
banned if this goes through
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
so the video that you would
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
have running in a grocery store
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
department store whatever
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
is a little different than the term
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology that is
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually matching up uh people maybe an
 
01:56:56.159 --> 01:56:57.669 align:start position:0%
actually matching up uh people maybe an
image

01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
image
 
01:56:57.679 --> 01:56:58.550 align:start position:0%
image
from

01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
that video would be used with the
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
technology to try to match up a person
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the difference between
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
what you're describing
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the technology that again i mean
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
before the technology you would have
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
someone in law enforcement look at that
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
video and then try to somehow match it
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
up with which
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
would take a long time so again this
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
kind of speeds up the process
 
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.270 align:start position:0%
kind of speeds up the process
um

01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
yup follow-up yeah thank you so in the
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
past when this technology was not
 
01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
past when this technology was not
available

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that they would
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
have a sketch somebody artists catch the
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
image and then witness would match up
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the sketch of if there was a
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
witness am i correct so there i think
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
are some law enforcement people here
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
from the state that can probably
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
get into that a little uh better than i
 
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.709 align:start position:0%
get into that a little uh better than i
can

01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not as familiar with their
 
01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
i'm not as familiar with their
techniques

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
techniques
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.629 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
so i think part of the motive behind
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
this is to
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
reduce mistaken identity
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh that it was suggested that
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
the software might
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
misidentify somebody and cause them you
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
know the person to be accosted for no
 
01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.709 align:start position:0%
know the person to be accosted for no
reason

01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
is it better to have a person personally
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
looking at it and and trying to identify
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
it would would that reduce
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
is is a person's eye more accurate than
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
the technology would that reduce
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
mistaken identities and
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
the problem of arresting somebody who
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
may not be the right person
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
and representative let me just say in
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
the 35 years that i've been lobbying up
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
here you're the first representative of
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
you that i've actually run into
 
01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
you that i've actually run into
so

01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
very nice to meet you hello i think the
 
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
first i was going to ask you how do you
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a yeah that's a fair question
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
exactly i mean um
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's going to be uh is any uh a
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
process perfect no
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
i do know that the technology
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
has gotten a lot better than it used to
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
be when it first came out
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
there was maybe a 89
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
success rate
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
but it's improved dramatically
 
01:59:16.639 --> 01:59:17.669 align:start position:0%
but it's improved dramatically
and

01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's getting better
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
as i understand this bill this would
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
prevent motor vehicle
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
who has the largest database of
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
faces in the state
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't prevent local law
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement from creating a network
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure your company or one of
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
them could produce that would take all
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
of the images
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
that the local police have
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
captured in their systems
 
01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:54.310 align:start position:0%
captured in their systems
in

01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
with people that are suspected of crimes
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
or actual criminals and sharing that
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
information amongst themselves
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
just without the use of the database
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding as well yes
 
02:00:07.119 --> 02:00:08.629 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding as well yes
exactly

02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:16.470 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
next up
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
frank nack from the aclu of new
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is frank knack i'm
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
the policy director with the aclu of new
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we are here in strong
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
support of hb 1447.
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
um i think this is one of those unusual
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
bills where it
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
like we can look at it from two
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
perspectives if the technology works is
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
one perspective to look at it but then
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
also looking at it from the reality that
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
this technology has a severe error rate
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so study after study have revealed
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
that their serious flaws with racial uh
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
mit back in 2018 did a study that found
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
that one in three times it misclassified
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
black women so over 33 percent
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the time it misclassified black women
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
more recently the national institute of
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
standards and technology did a massive
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
review and found that the algorith
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
algorithms false matched black women
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
between 10 and 100 times more often than
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
white men
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
and between 2 and 10 times more often
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
between white women and white men so
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
this technology works fairly well if
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
you're a middle-aged white person
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
outside of that category it does not
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
work has a fairly severe error rates
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
in addition the aclu
 
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
looked at we took all the members of
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
congress of federal congress
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
and ran them to the technology system it
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
false matched 28 members of congress as
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
someone who had committed a crime and
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
then again the error rate was there was
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
a staggering disparity between white
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
members of congress and black members of
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
congress at the time black members of
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
congress comprised about 20 percent of
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
the house and 39 of those where there
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
was an error rate
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
so that's and then also this technology
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
these tests were done with good mugshot
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
photos in reality we all know that the
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
way these photos are going to be
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
compiled are not going to be good you
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
know passport style photos are going to
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
be grainy photos from surveillance
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
cameras etc so again these horrible
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
error rates are then going to be
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
magnified when this technology is used
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the real world
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk a little bit about the
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
real world harms of this technology you
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
know this is not an abstract
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
conversation about how this analogy may
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
or may not work in theory in practice
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
at least three times black men have been
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
falsely arrested and we don't know more
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
than that because there's no
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
transparency around this so we don't
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
know how many times other people have
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
been falsely arrested
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
so we do know three times just from some
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
good reporting
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
one of those men was robert williams in
 
02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.589 align:start position:0%
one of those men was robert williams in
detroit

02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
detroit
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
he was arrested based on a false match
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
in his lawn in front of his wife and two
 
02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:13.350 align:start position:0%
in his lawn in front of his wife and two
children

02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
and he said i want to quote this how
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
does one explain to two young girls that
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
a computer got it wrong but the police
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
listened anyway
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
so this is the technology that we're
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
talking about bringing into new
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire it should be concerning to all
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
of us
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then let's look at it even if all
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
those factors those errors that i just
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned weren't true that this
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
technology actually worked this
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
technology is again something we should
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
not even consider bringing into new
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire this is the dystopian
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
nightmare this is the thing where
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
basically it's equivalent of having your
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license blown up put on your
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
person with a geo-locator and then
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
sending you out into the communities
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's how severe this technology is
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
this technology is certainly it's
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
currently being used in china for
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
example to completely map
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
certain populations how many times they
 
02:04:00.159 --> 02:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
certain populations how many times they
pray

02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
pray
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
where they enter their homes who their
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
social contacts are that should be
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
something that is extremely concerning
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
to us in a country where we value civil
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
liberties and civil rights where we
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
should be able to go to protest go to
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh health care providers
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment programs without
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
fear that all that information is in
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
going into a database that can then be
 
02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.550 align:start position:0%
going into a database that can then be
searched

02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
searched
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
and again six states including new
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire have already put limits in
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
certain cases on use of technology so in
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
our body cam law that we passed a few
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
years back there's a provision that
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
limits the use of facial
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
racial technician technology and use of
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
body cam footage and then 21 at least 21
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
local governments have also
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
banned the use of facial recognition
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
technology across the country including
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
a number of our neighboring localities
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts and maine and then
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
vermont has done a ban so we think this
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
is the right move for new hampshire we
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
think this technology is problematic in
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
its application and then even if it
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
worked it's not something we should
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
consider bringing into our state so
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is this something
 
02:05:12.079 --> 02:05:13.030 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is this something
that

02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:13.910 align:start position:0%
that
maybe

02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh could be used in a limited basis like
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
a fingerprint file where the computer
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
identifies a few possibilities and then
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
a human comes in after and
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
and verifies the information
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
could be considered i think from our
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
perspective we'd have even concerns with
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
that one because of the way it's
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually working in practice right now
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
with its severe error rate
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
particularly for non-middle-aged white
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
people and then two the impact that this
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
could have on the basic freedoms that we
 
02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:44.709 align:start position:0%
could have on the basic freedoms that we
enjoy

02:05:44.709 --> 02:05:44.719 align:start position:0%
enjoy
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's just this is a total surveillance
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
tool something that we have never seen
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
before you know think of automatic
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
license plate readers which have you
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
know severe concerns it enables you to
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
get around constitutional
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
rights protections in terms of the way
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
they're geofenced but it's not the total
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
invasive tool that this technology would
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
bring and even with alpr's we put limits
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
on those it's really restricted the use
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
of that so this is alpr's much much
 
02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:13.750 align:start position:0%
of that so this is alpr's much much
worse

02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
um i saw representative o'hara first
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i do agree with
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
you on the privacy aspect of the bill
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
um i just had a question if you because
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
i almost set the standard that about the
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
statistics part
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
sorry any
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
studies done
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
to show the accuracy difference between
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
the facial recognition and someone's
 
02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:45.030 align:start position:0%
the facial recognition and someone's
eyes

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
eyes
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
i've actually i don't know the answer to
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
that i can definitely look into that and
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
get back to you though
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
represented major potential
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
curious to find out
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
how does this compare with
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
inherent bias racial bias of human
 
02:07:05.679 --> 02:07:06.709 align:start position:0%
inherent bias racial bias of human
beings

02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
beings
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
you know it does identify and this is
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
digital you know to recognize
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's a tool
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
a tool is as good as uh the person who
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
creates the tool right so
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
any uh thought put into
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
finding which the racial bias inherent
 
02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:31.669 align:start position:0%
finding which the racial bias inherent
bias

02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
bias
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
versus digital bias because it was
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
developed that way yeah so in terms of
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
the like how the algorithm was created
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
itself um i'm not a technologist so i
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't get into the weeds of how the
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
algorithms were created um i do know
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that is a flag that has been raised
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
by others in this context and i think
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's also important to realize too that
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
you know the way this technology will
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
then be deployed on communities that
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
have been historically over policed and
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
under-resourced and so even in a state
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire you know marijuana is
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
a great example white people and black
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
people use marijuana at roughly the same
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
rate national studies have long shown
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire black people are
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
almost five times more likely to be
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
arrested for marijuana possession and so
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
we already know that policing is done in
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
a way that disproportionately harms
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
certain communities and so then when you
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
add in new technologies like this that
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
have inherent flaws in them that are
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
also going to disproportionately harm
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
black and brown community members you
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%

02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
i guess it's representative crawford
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned vermont and i was just
 
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:49.410 align:start position:0%
reading uh the previous gentleman's
 
02:08:49.410 --> 02:08:50.950 align:start position:0%
reading uh the previous gentleman's
[Music]

02:08:50.950 --> 02:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
statement that in vermont after a
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
sweeping ban on law enforcement's use
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
for past was passed in 2020 policymakers
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
discovered that the ban
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
exten extended even to software for
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
analyzing seized digital
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
evidence and child
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
sexual exploitation cases then they
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
they the legislature returned in 2021 to
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
pass a bill exempting such software
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
um i would have to look into that
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
specific angle and i also know in
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
vermont there's exceptions for search
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
and rescue as well so
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
these are not the state bands are not
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
total bands they are
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
kind of limited to certain scopes
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
so we think new hampshire could be
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
leading away in this respect
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
virginia for example just passed the
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
total moratorium on use thank you
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
telersky you still have one
 
02:09:46.159 --> 02:09:47.270 align:start position:0%
telersky you still have one
okay

02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
sorry um can i just have your um
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts we we pointed out to the
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor that the existing statute of
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
rsa 263
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
colon 40b
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
already prohibits
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
the use of facial recognition technology
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
yes i noted that when um the
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative noted that earlier and
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to research that as soon as i
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
get back i had not seen that before so
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
then i will hold up thank you i had only
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
seen in the context of bodywork cameras
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
where there's
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
a carve out
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just one question for me
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
does the federal government or any of
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
the federal law uh enforcement agencies
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
use this technology
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
um i believe the answer is yes and
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an effort underway to
 
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
have a federal moratorium but i don't
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
have all the specifics on the federal
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
level so thank you
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes captain joseph
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
ebert new hampshire state police in
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
hi good morning everyone my name is joe
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
ebert it's e-b-e-r-t i'm a captain with
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
the state police i oversee our
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
investigative services bureau which is
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
our detective bureau
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
so i want to start by saying i've
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
testified on facial recognition on uh
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
several years
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the past and this has been a
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
tremendous conversation i think a lot of
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
the points that typically have
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
cumulatively come up over the past uh
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
have been discussed this morning
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
so i was hoping to address uh we are in
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
opposition to the to the bill one of the
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh if i could direct your attention to
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
line four and five
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
in particular where it says nor shall
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
the department use face recognition
 
02:11:44.239 --> 02:11:45.589 align:start position:0%
the department use face recognition
technology

02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
this may be an unintended consequence of
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
the way that the bill was written but
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
the way that we read that is that we
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
would be as a state entity be prohibited
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
from using facial recognition technology
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise legal in another
 
02:11:58.639 --> 02:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise legal in another
jurisdiction

02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
there were some questions earlier about
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh what jurisdictions i uh mr chairman i
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
think you would ask does the federal
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
government the federal government does
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
allow for facial recognition technology
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
we often work joint cases with the
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
department of state
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
and they have a facial recognition
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
technology system
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
we also work with other out-of-state
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
agencies state police agencies mostly
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that have utilization of facial
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
recognition recognition systems
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
so i want to
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
i think an
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of this uh bill
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
creating a vulnerability uh or
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
furthering a vulnerability for new
 
02:12:41.599 --> 02:12:43.669 align:start position:0%
furthering a vulnerability for new
hampshire

02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
we as i mentioned have in the past had
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
especially with our troopers out of
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
troop g which is our dmv uh bureau
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
will do an investigation and they may be
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
doing an investigation on an imposter
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
they believe has fraudulently obtained a
 
02:12:58.079 --> 02:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
they believe has fraudulently obtained a
license

02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
they may work with an out-of-state
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction which they have done in the
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
past and identify that this individual
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
is in fact not who they claim to be
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
now there was some discussion
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
from one of the representatives about
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
the current prohibition that is on the
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
books as we understand the current
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
prohibition the the prohibition is of
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
using the facial
 
02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:21.990 align:start position:0%
using the facial
using

02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
the images that are captured by dmv for
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
facial recognition so what we do is we
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
find an individual that
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
may present to us for any number of
 
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
may present to us for any number of
reasons

02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
but somebody who's brought to our
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
attention as an individual who may in
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
fact be creating uh or committing a
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
crime we then find an alternative image
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
for that individual not using the
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles uh image
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
one of the prior
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
speakers had said to you that uh one of
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
the concerns they had was the uh
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
the poor format or the uh the uh the the
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
poor taking of this uh this image i i
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
would i would argue to you that that's
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
a good argument as to why you would use
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
the department of motor vehicles because
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is the very best image that you in
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
most instances that you can capture but
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
we we will find another image that has
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
been captured of this individual and
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
utilize that out of state technology or
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
that federal technology
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to bring your attention to a
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
2009 case which happened to be a case
 
02:14:24.079 --> 02:14:25.270 align:start position:0%
2009 case which happened to be a case
that

02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
i was the lead investigator on
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
which is why i know it well
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
it dealt with
 
02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
it dealt with
fraudulent

02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
licenses that were being issued through
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
the department of vehicles here in new
 
02:14:37.599 --> 02:14:38.790 align:start position:0%
the department of vehicles here in new
hampshire

02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
we worked with our out-of-state partners
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
on this particular case
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
and what we were able to find is that
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
there were numerous individuals who had
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
come to the state of new hampshire who
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
also had a license in neighboring states
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
what we also found in debriefing one of
 
02:14:54.639 --> 02:14:55.510 align:start position:0%
what we also found in debriefing one of
the

02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
primary individuals involved in this it
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
was a drug trafficking organization that
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
was facilitating the drug trafficking
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
via these fraudulent licenses
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
what we were also able to find as we
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
debriefed her she told us we
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted the state of new
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire because we knew you did not
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
have facial recognition technology so
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
she was telling us she was telegraphing
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
to us this is why we came to new
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire she also told us that when
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
those individuals
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
would come to they were often jump
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
points the jump points were
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
typically new york city or other large
 
02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:28.470 align:start position:0%
typically new york city or other large
cities

02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
cities
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
south of our border they would come to
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire they would obtain a
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
license they would obtain
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
other housing assistants other food
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
assistants and other assistants that is
 
02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.750 align:start position:0%
assistants and other assistants that is
available

02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
with good cause to those people within
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state who need it but they would do
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
that fraudulently and then they would
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
return to out of state
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
so uh what it pointed out to me or what
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
it highlighted to me is that uh we were
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in that regard
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
i think there was uh some good good
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
discussion both by the uh uh by the aclu
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh by the bill's sponsor about false
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
positives there was also some good
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
discussion uh somebody brought up a
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
fingerprint a partial fingerprint well
 
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
what happens with that partial
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
fingerprint is this partial fingerprint
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
what we take to a grand jury to indict
 
02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
what we take to a grand jury to indict
somebody

02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i i think it's really important to
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
know that facial recognition technology
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
is as one of the representatives uh
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
referred to it as as a tool it is one
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
part of an investigation
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh in the past i've been asked well
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
do you arrest people based on
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
the facial
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
the facial recognition technology hit
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
itself and the answer to that is no uh
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
the aclu had referenced prior to uh me
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
speaking uh
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
some cases where people were arrested i
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not familiar with them i will uh
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
take the time to to talk to the lobbyist
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
afterward because i am interested to see
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
were those cases where there was no
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
other investigation that was done that
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
they relied only on the
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
facial recognition hit
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's important if the state of
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is looking to put
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines around or guard rails to
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
around the use of facial recognition
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
technology then it should be discussed
 
02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
that uh there are certain steps that
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
have to be taken that it cannot be only
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
lice are the photo hit that is caused
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
for an arrest it shouldn't be there
 
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
should be other items
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
in the course of an investigation it
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
i also want to talk about uh eyewitness
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh eyewitness identification
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
so i found myself uh for a number of
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
different reasons to be before
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
committees to talk about uh
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
lineups and the fallibility of
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification and we know
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
from research that eyewitness
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
identification can be fallible
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
we also know that
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
there are false positives and that
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology can be
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
fallible but in the same way that we
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
address that with eyewitness
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
identification we use it as one piece to
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
a puzzle
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i've
 
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's my belief on behalf of the division
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
of state police if you start to take
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
away those pieces of the puzzle you can
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
never complete it
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
so if you say well eyewitness
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
identification is fallible and therefore
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't use it digital
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
identification is fallible and therefore
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't use it you start to take
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
away the tools that are available to law
 
02:18:22.309 --> 02:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to solve
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
these crimes that are impacting the
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
so with that um i i closed my testimony
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i am certainly willing to take any
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
the technology we have now on
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting um years ago used to hold
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
the two cards up and
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
try to figure out if you had the right
 
02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
try to figure out if you had the right
guy

02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
guy
 
02:18:49.679 --> 02:18:50.469 align:start position:0%
guy
but

02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
they take points in the fingerprint
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
almost exactly the same the way facial
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
recognition is done it picks
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
points in that face
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
um and compares it to another face
 
02:19:05.519 --> 02:19:06.709 align:start position:0%
um and compares it to another face
or

02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
another image that you have just like
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
fingerprint technology does
 
02:19:11.359 --> 02:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
fingerprint technology does
so

02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
am i wrong at that is that
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh so representative thompson thank you
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
for the question i i think it's
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
important to say that um
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
i believe that is my understanding of uh
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
what takes place with the back end of uh
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
facial recognition technology i think it
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
should also be pointed out that it's my
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh understanding and i can't say this uh
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
definitively so i just put that out as a
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
qualifier but it's my understanding that
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
fingerprint technology is is more
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
accurate than facial recognition
 
02:19:41.679 --> 02:19:42.950 align:start position:0%
accurate than facial recognition
technology

02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
but the concept
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
of what you're talking about is still
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
the same it's a part it's a piece it's
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
one thing that is analyzed it is given
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
back to you as one part of an
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
investigation that you will then use to
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
branch out into another part of an
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
investigation to try and corroborate
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
that evidence
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:04.309 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
o'hara

02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
o'hara
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
can i safely assume you've never gone to
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
a judge for an arrest warrant with just
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
a facial recognition you can okay follow
 
02:20:14.399 --> 02:20:15.990 align:start position:0%
a facial recognition you can okay follow
up

02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:18.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
in your in your opinion what would the
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
so it that uh representative o'hara
 
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for that question it's
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's certainly very uh it calls on a
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
lot of speculation on my part but in my
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
opinion a judge if you went to the judge
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
was simply just the uh the hit within a
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
facial recognition system i think it's
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
very likely the judge would not sign
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
that warrant but again i can't state
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
that as fact i can only surmise that
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
that would be the outcome of it but
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's my assumption when we write an
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit especially an affidavit for a
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
serious crime those are pages and pages
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
and pages for a homicide i
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
having worked in our major crime unit
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
for years uh a homicide affidavit is 60
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
70 80 pages long if not longer
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
though it's a listing of all the facts
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
in that case so i i feel very strongly
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
that if i went to a judge with an
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
affidavit that was one sentence long
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
that said this the system had turned out
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
a hit um that that that would likely not
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
be signed
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sayer for indulging me uh
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question a few
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
years ago this is my fifth term my
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
first and second term i've served on
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and public safety
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
during those times would you believe
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
that body cameras were just being
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
introduced and it was
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
new technology and it was not safe but
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
that has become a critical tool right
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
now so i understand this is maturing but
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
like you said hindrance if you don't
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
have another tool in your toolbox
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is our stance our stance is that um
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
there are very few things that should be
 
02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:11.349 align:start position:0%
there are very few things that should be
taken

02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
taken
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
as solely the answer to any question
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
but taking away the tools that we have
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
to find that answer
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
makes our job
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult and and i really
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize oftentimes when i sit
 
02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
before a committee i i think um as a
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
member of law enforcement may come
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
across that well your your job is to
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
find somebody and and put arrest that
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
person hold them responsible
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
but i can't state strongly enough that's
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
the position of the division of state
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
police that that is our job but our job
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
is also to find the right person
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we have absolutely no desire to
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerate somebody nor take somebody's
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
freedoms away who has
 
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
not committed a crime so when i hear the
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
description of somebody who was arrested
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
solely based on this
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
um and it was it turned out to be
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect that that's horrible that's a
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
horrible situation that i would never
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
want to encounter which is again why i
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
say if the state is looking to
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
put guardrails in uh around the use of
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
facial recognition recognition
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
technology we're more than willing to
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
one more
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you so i asked this question
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the previous
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
presenter too um
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
the human bias racial bias inherent bias
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
versus the technology bias how would you
 
02:23:32.350 --> 02:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
rate that how would you
 
02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
rate that how would you
[Music]

02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.190 align:start position:0%
[Music]
fix

02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
fix
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
sure uh so thank you uh for the the
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
question but
 
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:39.750 align:start position:0%
question but
uh

02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
i listened to that as i was uh sitting
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the back and i thought well that's a
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
really interesting point that i hadn't
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
um that i hadn't encountered before in
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that but i
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be
 
02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's certainly worth exploring uh if the
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee was so inclined to send this
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
to uh study it's it's certainly worth
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
a discussion as to
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
what is more uh fallible the bias in a
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
person or the software that facial
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
recognition uses and i don't know the
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
answer to that but i think it's an
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up yes
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
my question do you believe it's these
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill pass would uh
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
put victims of human trafficking in in
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
in like will hurt the investigation for
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
human trafficking is better than helping
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative perez thank you for the
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
i i think uh
 
02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
i i think uh
to

02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
hone it down to just one criminal
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
offense would be difficult what i think
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
i would feel comfortable saying is that
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
it would hinder the apprehension of
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
individuals who have committed multiple
 
02:24:53.439 --> 02:24:54.790 align:start position:0%
individuals who have committed multiple
crimes

02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of new hampshire
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
meaning uh they may in fact we may be in
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
fact be working with a federal partner
 
02:25:00.319 --> 02:25:01.670 align:start position:0%
fact be working with a federal partner
um

02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:05.429 --> 02:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
homeland security investigations on a
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
on on a case as you had mentioned so it
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
may hinder
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
human trafficking in that regard if
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
we're working that type of case it may
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
also hinder a drug investigation if
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're working with dea it may also
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
hinder an investigation into an impostor
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
obtaining a license so to answer your
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
question it could
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
impact human trafficking uh although i
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't know that direct coalition
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
correlation what i would say is
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
in our opinion it's our feeling that it
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
could hinder all criminal investigations
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative gorski
 
02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
this has been a tool that's been used
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
for a number of years here in law
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement how many years has the new
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire law enforcement been used in
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
facial recognition software
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
that is a very good question sir and one
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
i can get you the answer i
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know the specific answer to that
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
what i can tell you is the case that i
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
referenced was in 2008 okay so i know
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
that at least as far back as 2008 uh we
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
were using outside entities uh uh in in
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i also want to make this very clear
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
what we're not doing is we're not trying
 
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
to usurp any law that is passed here in
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire by saying
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay well we know that
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
pick a state another state is uh has
 
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
lawful facial recognition technology
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
therefore we'll just take our case
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
investigation over there and ask them
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
for a favor that's not the case uh what
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
has happened though in the past is when
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
we are working jointly with an
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
out-of-state jurisdiction and there is
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
reason to go to that outer state
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction we have utilized their
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
technology but in terms of how long sir
 
02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that however
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm more than happy to research it right
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:55.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
i just ask everybody to look at the
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
clock not that these questions aren't
 
02:26:58.560 --> 02:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
clock not that these questions aren't
important

02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up representative
 
02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.990 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up representative
uh

02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on i think one of
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
the fears is that
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know a crowd would be randomly
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
scanned at a protest or even a county
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
fair or something and every the list of
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
people who are in attendance is made
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
from their facial recognition hits is
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
that what do you
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
so i would not uh
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
i want to caution what i say is
 
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
with my own personal beliefs uh as
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to what the division of state
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
i i guess the uh the best way to phrase
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't see that as being an invalid
 
02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:45.190 align:start position:0%
i i don't see that as being an invalid
concern

02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
and if that was something a guardrail
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire wanted
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
to put in place
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something that the
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
division of state police would be
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
willing to discuss
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
it would not be our intent uh to be
 
02:27:58.479 --> 02:27:59.429 align:start position:0%
it would not be our intent uh to be
scanning

02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
scanning
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
large crowds of people
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh who were peacefully protesting uh not
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
committing any crime and then trying to
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
identify those individuals i can't
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
envision a time
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh devoid of a criminal undercurrent uh
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we would engage in that or that we
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be supportive of engaging in that
 
02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
would be supportive of engaging in that
representative

02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um i'm curious if you
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
believe um if you could clarify
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
that prohibits law enforcement from
 
02:28:32.399 --> 02:28:33.590 align:start position:0%
that prohibits law enforcement from
currently

02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
using dmv photographs is that correct
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
that is our understanding of that
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
statute okay quick follow-up
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that putting this
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
widespread prohibition of the technology
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
tacked onto a piece of motor vehicle law
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
is the proper and appropriate place to
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
put this prohibition or do you think
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps it needs to go somewhere else
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much representative
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the question i i won't pretend to
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
know the inner workings of how bills are
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
given uh amendments and whatnot i think
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
that's uh what what i can say is uh i'd
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
be uh i typically testify on this on the
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
other side of the hallway i'm not sure
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
how it ended up here but i'm happy to
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
testify in whatever committee the bill
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
appears before
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:28.309 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
much

02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh final speaker on this um
 
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
ross connolly from afp new hampshire uh
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
i will try and not stand between you and
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
lunch uh my name is ross connolly i'm
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
the deputy state director for americans
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
for prosperity in new hampshire uh here
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
to voice our support for hb 14 47. uh as
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
has been discussed this is an emerging
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
technology that that uh
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
in the wrong hands could be used very uh
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
nefariously and dangerously and we
 
02:30:08.309 --> 02:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
believe providing some some
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh guard rails within especially
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
government state government to ensure
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
that the the the technology is not being
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
abused and in the granite stater's
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to privacy is being
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
respected uh we do have a a
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to privacy here
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
article 2b
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
and uh we believe that this bill would
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
would be a good step to
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
backing that
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment up
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
with some actual law and making sure
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
that that those bounds are not being
 
02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
that that those bounds are not being
overstepped

02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
overstepped
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
our biggest concern
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
is really
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
government's using this technology in a
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
way that there there's no guard rails
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
and creating a panopticon of of constant
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance of individuals
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh that that could be used as as the the
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative from the aclu mentioned
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
in in very uh dystopian ways that that
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
has been implemented in other countries
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
other states do
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh use this technology in ways that we
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
do not but this legislation is proactive
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
instead of being reactive in its
 
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
approach to facial recognition
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
technology getting ahead of the problem
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
and making sure that
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
our government is not violat violating
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
these rights of granite staters
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh we think this would be an important
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
first step obviously there's a lot of
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions around how
 
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
the wording
 
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
i can't comment specifically on those
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
but i can say the way that we regard it
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
as is the only thing that's being
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
limited is the use of this statewide
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
database as has been pointed out a local
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
agency could still use this technology a
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
joint task force could still use this
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
technology with other jurisdictions uh
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
and we think that's appropriate that at
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
the state level we have a constitutional
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
that this database should not be
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
shared across government and using these
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
these neural net
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
platforms uh
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
with that uh just out of respect for the
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee's time i'll i'd be happy to
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if there are any
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir many questions from the
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative o'hara
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
i have to account uh just say i feel
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
like this should be like the last step
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to facial recognition this
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
is a complete ban um would you be
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
willing to help work with the committee
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
aclu and state police on
 
02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
aclu and state police on
getting

02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
getting
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
guardrails in place because i do think i
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
understand the liberty and safety and
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
privacy i do think we need to get
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
guardrails in place there
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
but i just think we need this is like a
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
last option
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:32:48.319 --> 02:32:49.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes and just just to provide some some
 
02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
background we would be happy to help uh
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
in a process if you were looking to
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
amend the bill uh last year this a
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
similar bill went through the criminal
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
justice committee uh it was a little
 
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
more complicated in restricting the use
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
requiring warrants and and i believe the
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor wanted to avoid some of those
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
those complications that arose of when
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
you can get a warrant when you can't uh
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
and and uh some of the the more
 
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty parts of how this is
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
implemented uh
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
we believe she she made it simpler to to
 
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
try and uh have people understand it's a
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
confusing topic
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
facial recognition and
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
so we'd be happy to work with with the
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee i i will point out we we do
 
02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a technology that
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
can be valuable and identifying suspects
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh someone mentioned human trafficking
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
earlier it is used uh for for to track
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
down human traffickers victims of human
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh so it is a a useful
 
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
technology it just there needs to be
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of guardrail so that uh rights
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
aren't being violated
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
you for your time uh that was the last
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
person i had signed up to speak is there
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else that wishes to
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll close the public
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.560 --> 03:34:34.229 align:start position:0%
 
yep

03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:37.590 --> 03:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back everybody i mean 104.
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the public hearing
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1474.
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
relative to annual vehicle inspections
 
03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing me i am as always
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative steven smith sullivan
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
county district 11. thanks for doing
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
these all in one day i appreciate it
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
so uh this bill
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
is to separate the two financial events
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
in somebody's life where they have to
 
03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
pay a hundred couple hundred bucks to
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
get their car registered
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
and then almost immediately find out it
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
needs another few hundred bucks worth of
 
03:35:39.190 --> 03:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
work to get past an inspection
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of inspection bills
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the safety argument is always the
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle should be seen once a year and i
 
03:35:48.150 --> 03:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
agree with that we have seen enough
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
busted parts come in from inspections
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
that in the last few months i haven't
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
pulled my wheels and checked my brakes i
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't check my wheel bearings i don't
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
know if there's any
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
up and down play in my ball joints that
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
happens when it gets inspected that's
 
03:36:04.710 --> 03:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
just what happens i was a mechanic for
 
03:36:07.269 --> 03:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
20 years i don't do it and i'd be
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
willing to bet that very few people in
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
this room have done that recently
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
so yes one year is the number
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
this bill accomplishes that right now if
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
you buy a car that has this is february
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it has a good november sticker on it
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
well it's not a year because you're
 
03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
going to register it and then you're
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to get it inspected again
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
why if the argument is see the car every
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
year see the car every year
 
03:36:34.630 --> 03:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
so what the bill accomplishes is that if
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
you buy one that has that good november
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
sticker you don't have to get it
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
inspected again until next november a
 
03:36:40.880 --> 03:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
inspected again until next november a
year

03:36:42.150 --> 03:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:36:44.070 --> 03:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you would like to get it inspected
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
sooner you can the person has control
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
if the person wants to always get the
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
car inspected in their birth month so
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
that they do the registration and
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
inspection at the same time they have
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
the freedom to do that
 
03:36:59.990 --> 03:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
for me who drives
 
03:37:02.309 --> 03:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
so much that i don't have a new vehicle
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
with a warranty because i'd chew it up
 
03:37:05.190 --> 03:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
in two years
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh my car is a 99 volvo at the moment
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to separate the events i
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't know my birthday's in june i'd
 
03:37:15.910 --> 03:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
like to get it done in april so that i
 
03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
can make a decision about whether or not
 
03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
to keep the car
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
mechanically it will probably be fine
 
03:37:23.190 --> 03:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
because i do my own work but then
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's those pesky codes on newer
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles and if i get one of those well
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
i could get the 60-day sticker and still
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
drive the car while i'm making a
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
decision about buying another one or
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
chasing codes and sensors to get it
 
03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:35.830 align:start position:0%
chasing codes and sensors to get it
fixed

03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
any event the car still gets seen at
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
least once a year
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
but i now have control over the
 
03:37:47.190 --> 03:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much what the first
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
section occurs
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh it accomplishes
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
it also gets rid of the
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the weird problem that we have in the
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
law now where you can get a 16-month
 
03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:02.790 align:start position:0%
law now where you can get a 16-month
inspection

03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
you can also get a 16-month registration
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
but the way the statute's written you
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
can fall in the middle where you're
 
03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
still going to be a year off on those
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
two what happened to my wife
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
we bought a car that had roughly 15 and
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
a half months to go
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we had to get an inspection for four
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
months later but we got a registration
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
for the next year
 
03:38:25.990 --> 03:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
talk about confusing and annoying
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
this does not affect vehicles owned by
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
companies or corporations that's the
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
last paragraph
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
if a vehicle is the the owner is a
 
03:38:37.590 --> 03:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
company or corporation other than a
 
03:38:39.670 --> 03:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
natural person hate that term but there
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is the annual inspection shall be
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
made during the month designated by the
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
director as the registration month for
 
03:38:48.790 --> 03:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
such a legal entity
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the only other change is language to
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
have the new methods still apply to
 
03:38:57.990 --> 03:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
antique vehicles
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
motorcycles recreational vehicles so
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
that they still get done in april in the
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
case of antique vehicles or july
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
motorcycles and rvs
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a lot of money and
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
you're driving that 10 or 20 year old
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
car you're probably not doing it because
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
you like it you're doing it because
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's your economic reality
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
to spend a couple hundred bucks to
 
03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
register it and find out within the next
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
10 days i just made a horrible mistake
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
because now this thing needs five or six
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars worth of work
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
800 000
 
03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden on a low-income family
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
that means they don't have a car that's
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
what that means or they're going to try
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
driving it without the inspection that's
 
03:39:44.479 --> 03:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
driving it without the inspection that's
worse

03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
worse
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
so let's give those people some control
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
over these events let them get their car
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
inspected whenever they want as long as
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't longer than a year from now and
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
manage their own affairs
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard that this will be confusing
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
it'll cause chaos if the numbers don't
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
match people won't know
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
when to get their cars inspected stop it
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
people are smarter than that but how do
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know when to get your car inspected
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
easy if you've chosen to separate it
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
from your birth month which is the only
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
way it will be different because right
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
now it matches the person will have to
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
make a conscious
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
effort to change that date
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
when you walk up to your car from the
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
nose there's this really colorful
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
sticker about this big with a number on
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
it that's when you get inspected and
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
besides that we know that chaos won't
 
03:40:35.110 --> 03:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
ensue because when i first started
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
coming up here in the 80s it didn't
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
match your birth month
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
every year
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
every vehicle
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
didn't match for half of the year
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
because inspections are six months so
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
and everything was okay then
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking the committee to do this
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
to let people take control of their
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
lives maybe make smarter decisions about
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
whether to fix or keep a vehicle
 
03:40:59.349 --> 03:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
and give them back that power thank you
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
03:41:02.950 --> 03:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:41:02.960 --> 03:41:06.790 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

03:41:06.790 --> 03:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:06.800 --> 03:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
it says
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
if your
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
sticker expires within the next four
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
months you need to have a letter saying
 
03:41:17.189 --> 03:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
you'll be out of town during your
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
inspection month can i choose to have my
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
car inspected any time as long as it's
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
before that one year or does it have to
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
be just within that four months if i'm
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
so okay the four-month thing for when
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
you're out of town that's actually the
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh the only change to it is to make the
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
reference to owner's birth month occurs
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
but no like if you're always gone every
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
summer or whatever at a certain time and
 
03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
you choose not to deal with that then
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
yeah just get your car inspected and
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
whatever month works for you
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative crawford
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
03:42:00.309 --> 03:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
do the inspection stickers and your
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
registration tags match
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
like if if i'm in to be inspected in
 
03:42:10.389 --> 03:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
january and i um registered my car
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
obviously in january because that's what
 
03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
it needed will that be confusing at all
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
for police or whoever looking at both
 
03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:19.030 align:start position:0%
for police or whoever looking at both
stickers

03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
stickers
 
03:42:20.630 --> 03:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:42:21.910 --> 03:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know those
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
stickers on the plates are pretty small
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
and considering where i live this time
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
of year you can't read my front plate
 
03:42:32.469 --> 03:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
um i i think the big inspection sticker
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the windshield that they can see is
 
03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
what they would taking on if you you're
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative hill
 
03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:42:48.389 --> 03:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
um did i understand that it's not going
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
to affect or would it affect
 
03:42:54.389 --> 03:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
um corporations all all are at one time
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the year and i think all
 
03:43:00.389 --> 03:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
leases are at one time of the year i may
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
be wrong about that
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's not affected by this legislation
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct the only
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
change to that paragraph
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh which is the last one section three
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:14.389 align:start position:0%
in the bill
um

03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
the previous language was without regard
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the owner's birth date
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
or registration month
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
referencing when the director says those
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
entities should register
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
it just changes the language to uh
 
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
strike that since it would no longer
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
apply but there's still whatever the
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
director says that's when you do it
 
03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:37.830 --> 03:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
wow seeing none thank you very much
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes car carl huddleston
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire state police
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
department of safety and opposition to
 
03:44:07.510 --> 03:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:08.950 --> 03:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for hearing
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
03:44:11.439 --> 03:44:12.469 align:start position:0%
my testimony
um

03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:14.550 --> 03:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
the department of safety stands in
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to this and
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
people now have been
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
ingrained in
 
03:44:25.590 --> 03:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
when i register my car
 
03:44:27.269 --> 03:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
i have to get it inspected a lot of
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
times when you re-register your car
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
whether it be at a dmv substation or at
 
03:44:34.710 --> 03:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
one of the town clerks that can do the
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
whole thing for you they often remind
 
03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
people that you need to get the vehicle
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
when we talk about enforcement roadside
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
or traveling down the road it will be
 
03:44:51.269 --> 03:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
more confusing for any police officer to
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the sticker that's
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
on the plate and the sticker that's on
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
the windshield
 
03:44:59.189 --> 03:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
yes i know those um little month
 
03:44:59.199 --> 03:45:00.229 align:start position:0%
yes i know those um little month
stickers

03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
stickers
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
for some people are hard to read but um
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
that that's ingrained in our minds when
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
we first start in law enforcement that
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
the little
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
month sticker is supposed to match the
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker on the windshield
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
we have had
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
the state owned vehicles run differently
 
03:45:23.110 --> 03:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
the registration month is march
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
and the inspection is in september new
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire d.o.t went to that
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
it took law enforcement quite a while
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
just to recognize that it was different
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason why
 
03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:35.750 align:start position:0%
and the reason why
so

03:45:35.750 --> 03:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
it would
 
03:45:41.110 --> 03:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass it would lend a lot
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
of confusion
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
not only to
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
and it coinciding with the registration
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
i think is probably the the biggest
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
benefit to the way the system is now
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
and as
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
it was just previously said you can get
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
an early inspection as well
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
under the current system that we have
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative talersky
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify what exactly what
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
you just said in terms of an earlier
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
inspection how many months in advance of
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
your posted
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
month can you go to get your inspection
 
03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:29.830 align:start position:0%
month can you go to get your inspection
four

03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
four months so you can do a 16-month
 
03:46:32.080 --> 03:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
four months so you can do a 16-month
sticker

03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
sticker
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay let's
 
03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:36.389 align:start position:0%
okay let's
out

03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
so potentially if someone was concerned
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
about if they were going to register the
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
car or not
 
03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
they could get it inspected a month or
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
two earlier yes absolutely thanks
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
for further questions representative
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
manchu putin thank you mr chair thank
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
isn't there a pro rating for
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
registration at this time so for example
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
if i sold my car before the registration
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
that whatever the prorated that would be
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes you would get some credit uh
 
03:47:09.510 --> 03:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
towards registering another vehicle if
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
you were to register another one
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
to replace a vehicle yes you would okay
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:20.229 --> 03:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
i i grew up in maine and i had my first
 
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
few cars there and
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
um the registration and the inspection
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
took place at the time you bought your
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
car would you support
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
that kind of a system where both are
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
valid you know required immediately and
 
03:47:37.189 --> 03:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
then annually after that
 
03:47:38.790 --> 03:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't necessarily coincide with
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
the owner's birth date um i
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think having them both i i understand
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
um the previous testimony about hardship
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
but financial hardship but i i think the
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
register and inspect in the same month
 
03:47:54.239 --> 03:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
register and inspect in the same month
um

03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
my concern would be is that hey i got it
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
registered i got four months or five
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
months before i have to get it inspected
 
03:48:01.760 --> 03:48:03.590 align:start position:0%
months before i have to get it inspected
and

03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
somebody actually forgetting about it
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
and overlooking it that's why i said a
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
lot of times when you register something
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
or register a new car
 
03:48:13.510 --> 03:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk reminds you that it needs to
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
be inspected within a certain period of
 
03:48:15.439 --> 03:48:17.590 align:start position:0%
be inspected within a certain period of
time

03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's a great benefit to
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
i have one and don't take the strong way
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not being sarcastic but how did
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
the department get over the confusion
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
when it was every six months and
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
currently how did you get over the
 
03:48:39.189 --> 03:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
confusion of even antiques over 40 years
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
that are every two years and the color
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
never changes how how do what there's
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
going to be a way to get around the
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
confusion well it's just education uh
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
really and
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of doing now granted the
 
03:48:52.630 --> 03:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
amount of antique cars on the road are
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
far less than
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
anything that's within 20 years
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't see it that often and
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
anybody in law enforcement
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
initially get trained
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's some of what
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
is presented in the motor vehicle
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
modules is that hey antiques are every
 
03:49:14.550 --> 03:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
two years motorcycles are
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
during the summer months
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
rv is
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
a different time of year than the
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
owners registration month as well
 
03:49:24.389 --> 03:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a matter of training
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
more than anything
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
so so i guess training would probably
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
take care of this one too so it might
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you um any other
 
03:49:34.229 --> 03:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
when

03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
when those foreigners are in from other
 
03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
states here do you um
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
view the inspections from other
 
03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh jurisdictions as well and and check
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
with license plate stickers and all that
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:50:00.319 --> 03:50:01.510 align:start position:0%
is that
so

03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:03.349 align:start position:0%
so
uh

03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:04.710 --> 03:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
yes or no
 
03:50:07.229 --> 03:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
so for a regular passenger
 
03:50:09.750 --> 03:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicle an out-of-state
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
plate we would not look at their
 
03:50:11.680 --> 03:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
plate we would not look at their
inspection

03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:14.309 align:start position:0%
inspection
um

03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
their inspection
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
from our neighbors to the south the
 
03:50:17.680 --> 03:50:18.790 align:start position:0%
from our neighbors to the south the
commonwealth

03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
commonwealth
 
03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:19.830 align:start position:0%
commonwealth
um

03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
their inspection
 
03:50:21.279 --> 03:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
their inspection
runs

03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
runs
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
with their registration
 
03:50:26.160 --> 03:50:30.070 align:start position:0%
with their registration
it's

03:50:30.070 --> 03:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
we would not cite somebody from
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in a passenger vehicle
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
that was not
 
03:50:36.479 --> 03:50:38.150 align:start position:0%
that was not
inspected

03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that's their state's requirement
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's for massachusetts to enforce
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts on the commercial side yes
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
we would there's a federal
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
regulation that says the vehicle has to
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
be inspected
 
03:50:51.920 --> 03:50:53.189 align:start position:0%
be inspected
annually

03:50:53.189 --> 03:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
annually
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
so a commercial vehicle yes we would a
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
passenger or a non-commercial vehicle
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh last to speak
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
i apologize if i mispronounced steve
 
03:51:13.120 --> 03:51:14.309 align:start position:0%
i apologize if i mispronounced steve
zemenek

03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
zemenek
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
representing himself in support of the
 
03:51:16.080 --> 03:51:18.389 align:start position:0%
representing himself in support of the
bill

03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
how'd i do
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
all right i'm steve samanic uh i'm from
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
manchester i'm here on my own dime in my
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
own time
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh and i support this bill um
 
03:51:36.150 --> 03:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
because of uh
 
03:51:37.990 --> 03:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are people may have multiple
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles you know maybe they have a
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
sports car that they only drive in the
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the summer
 
03:51:43.750 --> 03:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
in their birthdays in the
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the um in the winter but also you
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
know or maybe someone's away out of out
 
03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
of state for college or what whatever
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it seems very arbitrary but one
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
thing i've noticed
 
03:52:01.269 --> 03:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
is that there are a lot of people who
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
put off their
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle repairs until it's time to do
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
their inspection and the reason they do
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is because they feel like they're
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
getting screwed every time they go to
 
03:52:11.670 --> 03:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
get an inspection sticker so they say
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to give them something to
 
03:52:13.040 --> 03:52:13.990 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to give them something to
find

03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to wait until my birthday
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
to get my tires or breaks or whatever
 
03:52:20.640 --> 03:52:22.950 align:start position:0%
to get my tires or breaks or whatever
and

03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
that way they're going to get the whole
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
year out of it and they're gonna
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're not gonna they don't
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
they're not gonna get the brakes done
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
three months later they're gonna say oh
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
well now you need all new tires or uh
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
suspension rebuild or whatever
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
so i think that by letting people you
 
03:52:42.790 --> 03:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
know get an inspection sticker every
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
time they get an oil change
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
might actually improve road safety uh
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
and the safety of the vehicles that are
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you they take any
 
03:52:54.960 --> 03:52:56.550 align:start position:0%
all right thank you they take any
questions

03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%

in house bill 1426 fn
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
eliminating the vehicle inspection
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%

thank you to the chairman uh and to the

04:01:23.120 --> 04:01:25.349 align:start position:0%
representing stratford county district
13

04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
13
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
and back with a bill that some members
 
04:01:31.349 --> 04:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
might remember this is nearly identical
 
04:01:34.870 --> 04:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
to a bill filed two years ago that
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
did not get a vote on the house floor it
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
emerged during the night
 
04:01:40.870 --> 04:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
before kovit when we had a marathon
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
session it was
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
summarily tabled
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
um but this is uh virtually identical so
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
what this would do is um it would
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
eliminate the safety inspection
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
requirement for non-commercial vehicles
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles would still be
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
required to
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh and that only back up uh
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicles would still need
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
to do the the annual emissions check if
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
this were to pass
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles would still need to
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
do a safety inspection and the emissions
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
check just like
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh just like they do now
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
and you would discern a commercial
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle from a non-commercial vehicle by
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
one that is
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:20.000 --> 04:02:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
a

04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
something other than a natural person so
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's how you would clear that up
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
the underlying premise here is that
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
safety inspections while a good idea
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
are not something that should be
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
mandatory and while that might seem
 
04:02:33.359 --> 04:02:36.790 align:start position:0%
mandatory and while that might seem
counterintuitive

04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
i mean because right an inspection would
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
have to make the road safer right well
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
the data does not show that there's
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely no data linking inspections
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
with better outcomes and better safety
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
on a roadway
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the congressional budget office is
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
just the latest
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
organization to look for a link and not
 
04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
find one
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
so first of all there are 36 states that
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
do not require an annual safety
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
inspection that number is trending
 
04:03:02.950 --> 04:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
upward not downward
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
connecticut and new jersey are among the
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
most recent states to eliminate their
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
inspection programs
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
states with inspections
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
can have similar climates to new
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire one of the things we tend to
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
hear is that new hampshire is this
 
04:03:16.479 --> 04:03:18.229 align:start position:0%
hear is that new hampshire is this
um

04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know holy uh or it's this
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
basically what we hear is that we beat
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
cars up more than any other state due to
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
climate and salt and bad roads and this
 
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh this all comes together to
 
04:03:30.800 --> 04:03:31.990 align:start position:0%
uh this all comes together to
um

04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:33.429 --> 04:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
beat up our cars well there are other
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
states that have similar conditions that
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
that don't have inspection that have
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
better safety
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
data than new hampshire that includes
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
minnesota michigan wisconsin
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
colorado montana and alaska they have
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
similar climates they don't have
 
04:03:47.199 --> 04:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
similar climates they don't have
inspections

04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
in minnesota and ohio and washington
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
states without inspections
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
are among the safest states in the u.s
 
04:03:57.910 --> 04:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
for motorists
 
04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
but texas louisiana and virginia
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
inspection and there they have
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
inspections and they're among the least
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
safe state for motorists
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
the national highway traffic safety
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
administration studied component
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
failures or the effect of component
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
failures in more than 2.1 million
 
04:04:12.720 --> 04:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
failures in more than 2.1 million
crashes

04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
crashes
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
they found that these component failures
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
things you'd find in inspection were
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
present in two percent of crashes
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh more than a third of those two
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
percent were tire failures and that
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
could come with a new tire or a bald
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
tire there's no way to know
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
um driver behavior accounted for 94
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
percent of crashes driver behavior
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
the federal congression oh we already
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
talked about that um so inspections for
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
all the comfort they offer it's a
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
snapshot in time it says a vehicle on a
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
certain day
 
04:04:46.309 --> 04:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
meets the inspection criteria according
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
to one shop inspections last for up to
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
16 months as we just heard
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
during which time a motorist could drive
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know 1500 miles or 50 000 miles
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
despite the scarcity of data linking
 
04:05:02.469 --> 04:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
inspections to highway safety we know
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
that one in five vehicles in our state
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
already fail an annual inspection
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
so that means for weeks or months
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
or potentially more than a year they're
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
driving around our state and it's in a
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
condition that would not pass an
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
inspection and yet new hampshire still
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
ranks in the top 10 or 12
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
each year for road safety
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
another metric to consider is that new
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not limit vehicles
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
into our state that are not inspected so
 
04:05:31.830 --> 04:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
look around in the summer time
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
states from vehicles from connecticut
 
04:05:35.590 --> 04:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
new jersey and much further afield
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
without inspection are traveling our
 
04:05:39.269 --> 04:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
roads and as we heard during testimony
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
for this bill two years ago the state
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
police has found no link from
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
uninspected vehicles in our state and
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
and causing crashes or any other
 
04:05:47.520 --> 04:05:48.630 align:start position:0%
and causing crashes or any other
problems

04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:05:48.640 --> 04:05:49.910 align:start position:0%
problems
so

04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
one thing we just heard of is that from
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
another bill is that
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
some people are able to look at their
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles and and know what's going on
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
with them i'm not one of those people i
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
have no idea what's going on with my
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle at any time
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
but most people are are like me
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
and people in the 36 states without
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
inspections they're not all mechanics
 
04:06:10.080 --> 04:06:11.269 align:start position:0%
inspections they're not all mechanics
either

04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and yet as we know states without
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
inspections are just as safe or safer
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh roadways so the key point here is not
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
that inspections don't have value
 
04:06:20.479 --> 04:06:21.269 align:start position:0%
that inspections don't have value
it's

04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're a fine idea it's that
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be mandatory
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
we don't mandate health checkups also a
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
good idea but we don't require people to
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
we know inspections hit lower income
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
residents the hardest
 
04:06:36.870 --> 04:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
and operating with an expired sticker is
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of the most common infractions for
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
our state
 
04:06:39.520 --> 04:06:40.710 align:start position:0%
our state
police

04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
police
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
and while most inspection shops in the
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
state are honest trustworthy some are
 
04:06:44.479 --> 04:06:45.429 align:start position:0%
state are honest trustworthy some are
not

04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
consumers have no ability to gauge for
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
themselves whether a repair is needed to
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
get or whether it's truly necessary to
 
04:06:53.590 --> 04:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
get the sticker that's not impugning
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyone that's just a fact that's a power
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
dynamic that puts people at risk of
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
being abused so finally i'll end this
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh by saying you know i hope you'll
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
consider this and give it careful
 
04:07:04.479 --> 04:07:05.590 align:start position:0%
consider this and give it careful
thought

04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
inspections are not a bad idea and and i
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
would expect that
 
04:07:12.150 --> 04:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
if and when this the state ever does
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
away with them you know auto repair
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
shops would continue to offer a product
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
to people that would be voluntary and um
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
and if it's worth it people would do it
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
if it's not they wouldn't so i'd ask you
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
to please consider passing this and i'm
 
04:07:28.150 --> 04:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:07:33.750 --> 04:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'm saying when
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking i'm sitting here thinking
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
can you think of another service or good
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is provided by the private sector
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you for the
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
question i you know off the top of my
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
head sitting here a little nervous
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
presenting a bill i can't but um you
 
04:07:52.630 --> 04:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
know as it pertains to this this
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
the short answer is i can't answer the
 
04:07:53.920 --> 04:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
the short answer is i can't answer the
question

04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative fenton
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for joining us
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
today and thanks for taking my question
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
um that is a hefty fiscal note
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's maybe one of the largest
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen in this committee uh how
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
would we go about making up that money
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you you're
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
discussing the 720 000 number
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh in a in a budget of 11 or 12 billion
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think we could find it uh their state
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
revenue from a sticker is only a few
 
04:08:27.199 --> 04:08:29.590 align:start position:0%
revenue from a sticker is only a few
dollars

04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason to believe that
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
the short answer is we could find that
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.189 --> 04:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.199 --> 04:08:46.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:08:46.469 --> 04:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative um the one part that's
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
sticking out to me in the fiscal note
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
which i think you addressed but i just
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that's what you meant
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
is um it is assumed that inspection
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
stations will rely on the vehicle owner
 
04:09:01.110 --> 04:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
to designate if the passenger vehicle is
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
used in the regular course of business
 
04:09:03.359 --> 04:09:04.309 align:start position:0%
used in the regular course of business
um

04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
is that where you're talking about that
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
if a
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
vehicle is used for business it must be
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
registered in such a way
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard you say it but i'm
 
04:09:13.199 --> 04:09:14.550 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard you say it but i'm
wanted

04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so so much of
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
the inspection program is done via
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking i believe that could be
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
addressed via rules but there is a
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
provision in the current law stipulating
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
or certain things if a vehicle is owned
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
by a non-person a corporation so we know
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's not a uh
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
we could make a logical guess that that
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
would be a commercial vehicle
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
it could it could be addressed via rules
 
04:09:41.110 --> 04:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know do you use this as a business
 
04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle and if they don't there could be
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
infractions for for not telling the
 
04:09:43.840 --> 04:09:45.189 align:start position:0%
infractions for for not telling the
truth

04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
truth
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know it could be addressed with
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
relative simplicity i think thanks
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman walsh thank you
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative connolly for taking my
 
04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
i hear your
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
point about there being being no colla
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative information between or
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's the right word that
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
i want but there's no connection between
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
inspections and safety
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
equally is it not true though that
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
there's no data to tell us
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
how many
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
because it can't prove an
 
04:10:19.840 --> 04:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
because it can't prove an
unknown

04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
but there could be and have been i
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
assume crashes
 
04:10:25.600 --> 04:10:26.469 align:start position:0%
assume crashes
that

04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
didn't happen because cars were
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
inspected on an annual basis and there's
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
no data to
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
know that one way or the other
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
question it's unknowable
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
but i would look at other states without
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
inspections and look at the fact that
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know better or higher performing or
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you want whatever word you want
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
to use
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
just their roads are deemed safer
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
without inspection so um
 
04:10:53.670 --> 04:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
you you can't predict a crash or you
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
can't discuss a crash that didn't happen
 
04:10:56.710 --> 04:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
but you would look at what other states
 
04:11:01.110 --> 04:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thanks for taking the
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
question so there's other states that
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
are examples uh connecticut new jersey
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
do you also know whether or not since
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
the owner of the car is responsible
 
04:11:18.149 --> 04:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
they've elevated any equipment
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
violations to
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
crimes like bad breaks being a
 
04:11:21.520 --> 04:11:23.189 align:start position:0%
crimes like bad breaks being a
misdemeanor

04:11:23.189 --> 04:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i don't know
 
04:11:26.710 --> 04:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
that answer but i do know that were
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
someone to violate
 
04:11:28.560 --> 04:11:29.429 align:start position:0%
someone to violate
um

04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:31.269 --> 04:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
or to be driving an unsafe vehicle they
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
could be cited by our state police as
 
04:11:35.030 --> 04:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
they could currently so if this were to
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
take effect and you're driving an unsafe
 
04:11:38.710 --> 04:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle there is that mechanism to
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and in new hampshire do you
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
get a criminal record out of that or is
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
it a violation that was the point i was
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
trying to make
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative i don't have an answer to
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
that question
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee um
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative fenton
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just to
 
04:12:02.469 --> 04:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
follow up on that um
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
unsaved vehicle aspect i had a friend
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
recently in florida and he sent me a
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
picture of a dodge caravan with the with
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
the bumper uh
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
zip tied on
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
so that bumper fell off in that state
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
and caused an accident they wouldn't
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
attribute it to a state inspection
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
violation because as you said they're
 
04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
not accounting or that's how they
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
account for it but that's
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how that data would
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
be accurate if there's no state
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
inspections a car like that would fail
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i think i
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand what you're getting at is how
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
would you characterize the cause of that
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
accident if the bumper were to cause
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
another vehicle to cause an accident i
 
04:12:44.800 --> 04:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
another vehicle to cause an accident i
didn't

04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
i didn't look at the methodology of the
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
data to know how it they would
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
characterize it
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
but i think if if a component was in the
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
roadway that would probably be cited but
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
again i can't answer that with any
 
04:12:56.080 --> 04:12:58.710 align:start position:0%
again i can't answer that with any
certainty

04:12:58.710 --> 04:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
certainty
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%

thank you

representative
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
for your presentation today the
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
beginning of your
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
testimony you said that
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
you were not a mechanic you really
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have an idea of
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
of what it was all about and i would and
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
i i believe you also said most people
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
you thought probably don't
 
04:13:21.279 --> 04:13:22.309 align:start position:0%
you thought probably don't
um

04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:22.319 --> 04:13:23.830 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
the state police or local police are
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
able to cite someone
 
04:13:32.469 --> 04:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
for a violation of for having unsa an
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
unsafe vehicle how are these people
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to know they have an unsafe
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle if they don't have a state
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
inspection or have some sort of an
 
04:13:40.159 --> 04:13:41.429 align:start position:0%
inspection or have some sort of an
inspection

04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:13:41.439 --> 04:13:42.710 align:start position:0%
inspection
um

04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question there's
 
04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
uninspected vehicles there's vehicles
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
that fail inspection and then there are
 
04:13:54.479 --> 04:13:56.149 align:start position:0%
that fail inspection and then there are
um

04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are clearly unsafe you
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
could be inspected and you could be
 
04:13:59.199 --> 04:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
could be inspected and you could be
driving

04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
driving
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
an unsafe vehicle according to the
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
standards set forth by the state which i
 
04:14:05.910 --> 04:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
i did i reviewed them two years ago i
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
didn't review them before this bill so
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
might be good reading but you could be
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
inspected in driving a vehicle deemed
 
04:14:11.840 --> 04:14:14.710 align:start position:0%
inspected in driving a vehicle deemed
unsafe

04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:14:16.080 --> 04:14:17.030 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
no

04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:14:19.110 --> 04:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much just one for clarity
 
04:14:20.149 --> 04:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass any vehicle that
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
needs a missions test will still be
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
required to go once a year to get that
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
test completed
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%

business in new hampshire
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
and i've seen a lot of really bad
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
inspections over the years where cars
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
were extremely dangerous to be on the
 
04:15:19.840 --> 04:15:20.710 align:start position:0%
were extremely dangerous to be on the
road

04:15:20.710 --> 04:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
and my concern here
 
04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
my family who
 
04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
you would think would be tuned into
 
04:15:30.399 --> 04:15:32.710 align:start position:0%
you would think would be tuned into
automobiles

04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
automobiles
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
when they have their cars inspected are
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
often surprised that they have issues
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
with their car that they didn't know
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:15:43.110 --> 04:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
and these are people that are tuned in
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
to cars and they've been we've been
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing this since we've had kids we have
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
four kids six grandchildren
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
and my concern is these people that
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
don't feel they need to have an
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
inspection coming in the opposite
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
direction with an unsafe car that
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
concerns me i've been doing
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
i want to point out that i'm a certified
 
04:16:06.080 --> 04:16:07.030 align:start position:0%
i want to point out that i'm a certified
master

04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
master
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
automotive technician and a certified
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
bosch technician as well
 
04:16:12.239 --> 04:16:13.269 align:start position:0%
bosch technician as well
and

04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of cars on the road
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
today that people don't even know that
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're dangerous it's something as
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
simple as a
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
ripped wiper blades
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
extremely pitted windshield
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
when you're driving into the sun at the
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
very dangerous and these are things that
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
can be pointed out
 
04:16:39.189 --> 04:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
during a state inspection and
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
i i would bet that most of the people in
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
this room do not
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
walk around and look physically at the
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
wear on their tires
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
once a week
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
right i'm i'm sure of that
 
04:16:51.359 --> 04:16:52.630 align:start position:0%
right i'm i'm sure of that
so

04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:55.670 --> 04:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what i have to say
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
04:16:57.120 --> 04:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
next up uh alicia brinson from new car
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
hello everyone i'm alicia i'm from new
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
car automall tilton new hampshire i
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
started off in the industry as an
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
automotive technician
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
my license has since expired but i was
 
04:17:41.110 --> 04:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
formally a licensed inspector
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
i started with toyota i worked for
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
toyota for a couple of years i'm pretty
 
04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
sure a lot of you here have probably
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
heard of the class action lawsuit in
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
regards to frames
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
the amount of rust and corrosion i saw
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
on many vehicles that we were replacing
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
frames on was absolutely absurd
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
i even remember a situation i had one of
 
04:18:01.110 --> 04:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
my friends he bought a vehicle from
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
basically private sale i can't remember
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
exactly where and he had asked if i
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
could do a state inspection for him so
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
he came in i put his truck up on the
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
lift and looked underneath the vehicle
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
there was black spray paint everywhere
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
there was actually a spot on his frame
 
04:18:19.110 --> 04:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
where they had put tin foil and then
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
spray spray painted black paint over it
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
when i took off the tin foil i noticed a
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
hole in his frame probably the length of
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
my arm
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the vehicle was severely
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
unsafe to drive
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
he was pretty distraught he was upset
 
04:18:34.149 --> 04:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
just because they gave him the
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
impression that the vehicle was safe to
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
drive it was
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
deemed well for the road
 
04:18:41.189 --> 04:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
basically everything had looked into it
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
checked out everything was kosher and
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
after i had called that to his attention
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
he was very upset if you can imagine
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing a vehicle that you're
 
04:18:49.830 --> 04:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
thinking safe to drive putting your car
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
seats in the back putting your kids in
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
the vehicle and then gaining the
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
understanding that your vehicle is not
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
safe for the road if he were to hit a
 
04:18:58.710 --> 04:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
pothole at any point in time from the
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
point that he had picked up his car to
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
bring it to me to get it inspected that
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
could have been a very sticky situation
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
i even recall another situation i had a
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman with a tundra he brought his
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle in for a state inspection i put
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
it up on the lift i noticed that his
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
the strap for his gas tank was severely
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
corroded it hadn't given away just yet
 
04:19:20.309 --> 04:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
but it actually gave enough space for
 
04:19:23.189 --> 04:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
the fuel tank to sag and shift
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
i noticed witness marks on the fuel tank
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
and when i called him out there to show
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
him the damage and the witness marks he
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
had actually informed me that while he
 
04:19:33.269 --> 04:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
was towing his camper he was hearing an
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
abnormal noise that he hadn't heard
 
04:19:34.800 --> 04:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
abnormal noise that he hadn't heard
before

04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the vehicle even further i
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
noticed further
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
witness marks on the drive shaft so
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
when he was towing his camper with the
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
weight of the camper
 
04:19:47.110 --> 04:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
it actually was causing the fuel tank to
 
04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
rub against his drive drive shaft
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you can only imagine all the friction
 
04:19:53.349 --> 04:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
that creates there and the amount of
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
heat that could have potentially caused
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
a fire
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know the occupants in his
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle at that time but obviously that
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
could have raised a potential to be
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
severely unsafe for himself and other
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
people on the road
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
even just the amount of damage that
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
would have caused for him and his
 
04:20:08.720 --> 04:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
would have caused for him and his
livelihood

04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
another situation i recall i was working
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
on a corolla i had pulled off the wheels
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
to conduct an inspection so in the state
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire you have to pull off
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
one wheel per axle
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
i remember removing the right front
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
wheel there was absolutely no brake pad
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
left the shim that's behind the brake
 
04:20:27.189 --> 04:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
pad wasn't even existing
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
when we had informed the customer of the
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
news she was honestly so distraught even
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
i was young at the time i have a
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
daughter now but at that time i didn't
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
have children but i did see a car seat
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the back and obviously snacks that
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
her daughter um i'm assuming daughter
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
because the car seat was pink um had
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
eaten like just on journeys on the road
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
with her mother and realistically having
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
no brakes in the right front like the
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
front of the car and these were disc
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
brakes so obviously do they do the most
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
braking in the front
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
she was pretty distraught when we gave
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
her the news she didn't end up doing the
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
repairs there but she did come back for
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
reinspection i did notice that there
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
were aftermarket parts on the vehicle
 
04:21:05.910 --> 04:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
but even so at least the vehicle was
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
safe to drive after she gained awareness
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
that her brakes were deemed unsafe
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
a prior analogy was made before so it
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
looks like we're comparing like our
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
livelihoods so how we go every year to
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
well some of us i know i don't
 
04:21:20.319 --> 04:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
well some of us i know i don't
personally

04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
personally
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
but we
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
we go get our physicals done annually
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
our general health doesn't affect
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
your vehicle being unsafe to drive you
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
getting on the road if you have no
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
brakes where are you going to stop the
 
04:21:37.269 --> 04:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
car in front of you more than likely
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
so my general health obviously me taking
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
vitamins and making sure i stay healthy
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect anybody else if i were to
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
die early or if i were to die due to a
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
mishap due to not having that
 
04:21:48.960 --> 04:21:50.469 align:start position:0%
mishap due to not having that
yearly

04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
yearly
 
04:21:50.479 --> 04:21:51.269 align:start position:0%
yearly
um

04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
i want to call it inspection but you're
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
like if i didn't go to the doctor
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
annually that doesn't affect anybody but
 
04:21:55.840 --> 04:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
annually that doesn't affect anybody but
me

04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
my family would miss me but it doesn't
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
affect them directly if i have poor
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
brakes or my vehicle's unsafe to drive i
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
hit a pothole or i can't stop
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
realistically i'm putting somebody
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
else's livelihood in danger
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.479 --> 04:22:22.229 align:start position:0%
 
almost

04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
almost
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming today and thanks for
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question i'm glad you brought
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
up frame damage so particularly where
 
04:22:30.149 --> 04:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
trailing arms connect or maybe spring
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
shackles or other suspension components
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
can it be the case that
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
feels just fine until you finally hit
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
that top hole that's a pothole that
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely sometimes it doesn't even
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
take a pothole depending on how much
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
rust is there at any moment if those
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
components were to give away you could
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
lose steering of the vehicle
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially if you're not a
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
confident driver even for unseen
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances i know her initial
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
reaction to something is to panic and to
 
04:22:59.760 --> 04:23:00.389 align:start position:0%
reaction to something is to panic and to
not

04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
observe our surroundings to figure out a
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
safe remedy for a problem so
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
realistically when you're thinking of
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
crashing it could be into another car or
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
something else within the road
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.110 --> 04:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
next up bill gurney gurney's auto
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
hearing me
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
my name is bill gurney i own gurney's
 
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
automotive in nashua new hampshire and
 
04:23:43.040 --> 04:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
automotive in nashua new hampshire and
milford

04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
milford
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
i've been in the automotive industry
 
04:23:47.910 --> 04:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
since i was 16 years old which
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
makes that 46 years
 
04:23:53.429 --> 04:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
we've been in business since 1985.
 
04:23:56.710 --> 04:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
i am a aaz master technician as well and
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.389 --> 04:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
state inspections is compared to other
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
states everybody has different rules so
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
i think that the data are using one
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
state against the other elves
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't always hold water because
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
someone's inspection in massachusetts is
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
different from ours so i think we need
 
04:24:19.030 --> 04:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
to take that into consideration
 
04:24:21.030 --> 04:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about the statistics of
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
states that have inspections and that do
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
not have inspections
 
04:24:26.159 --> 04:24:27.830 align:start position:0%
not have inspections
um

04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
i would submit to you that
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
if we ask
 
04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
does this law
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
do inspections make the roads safer
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think you could argue that they
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
make the roads less safe to some point
 
04:24:49.110 --> 04:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
is that less safe less safe to the point
 
04:24:50.950 --> 04:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
of one fatality
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
one person paralyzed
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
property damage a year i don't know
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
but i will tell you i see cars that come
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
in and have come in
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
with people that take care of their cars
 
04:25:07.110 --> 04:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
that don't know something is about to go
 
04:25:07.120 --> 04:25:07.990 align:start position:0%
that don't know something is about to go
wrong

04:25:07.990 --> 04:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
coil spring
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
in a car can break someone hears a noise
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
they don't take care of it because it
 
04:25:13.920 --> 04:25:14.950 align:start position:0%
they don't take care of it because it
still

04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
still
 
04:25:17.110 --> 04:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
rides fairly well
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
that car does not handle and will not
 
04:25:19.920 --> 04:25:21.269 align:start position:0%
that car does not handle and will not
perform

04:25:21.269 --> 04:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
perform
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
especially in a
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
maneuver it needs to make
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
and be safe it won't
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
and they could ride like that for
 
04:25:30.479 --> 04:25:31.590 align:start position:0%
and they could ride like that for
months

04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:25:33.990 --> 04:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
without knowing that
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i think statistics are great
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
but i think we all know that we can all
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
make statistics say whatever we'd like
 
04:25:42.070 --> 04:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i think i would like you to consider
 
04:25:42.080 --> 04:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
so i think i would like you to consider
that

04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
as a professional
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
to eliminate state inspections
 
04:25:53.590 --> 04:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.600 --> 04:25:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:54.720 --> 04:25:56.070 align:start position:0%
uh
problematic

04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
for the consumers in this state and for
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
people's safety
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
in vermont a couple years ago
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
there was a gentleman that inspected a
 
04:26:05.520 --> 04:26:06.630 align:start position:0%
there was a gentleman that inspected a
car

04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
car
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
in vermont
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:26:09.120 --> 04:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
and um
didn't

04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
perform it properly and there was some
 
04:26:12.640 --> 04:26:13.750 align:start position:0%
perform it properly and there was some
rust

04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
rust
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
and there was a fatality
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to know if i take
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
inspections seriously in our business
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
the gentleman inspected that car went to
 
04:26:23.600 --> 04:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
the gentleman inspected that car went to
jail

04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
jail
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
for negligent homicide
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
we take it very seriously that we're
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with people's
 
04:26:32.319 --> 04:26:37.269 align:start position:0%
dealing with people's
livelihoods

04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.790 --> 04:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
their families
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
their children
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's what's important fixing cars is
 
04:26:51.429 --> 04:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
what i do
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
but taking care of people and their
 
04:26:53.359 --> 04:26:54.389 align:start position:0%
but taking care of people and their
families

04:26:54.389 --> 04:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:26:57.429 --> 04:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
is really what we do
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions i'd be more
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer them
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the kid
 
04:27:03.199 --> 04:27:04.149 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the kid
committee

04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative manager putin
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
my question is in regards to the
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
different state inspections
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
um are they very very different from
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
state to state some aspects of the
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
safety inspection that new hampshire has
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
is that incorporated into the general
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
inspection in other states which does
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
not have the two-part
 
04:27:30.399 --> 04:27:31.670 align:start position:0%
not have the two-part
inspection

04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
yes the state of massachusetts for
 
04:27:35.429 --> 04:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
example when you bring it in there they
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily take wheels off they
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily put the cars up in the
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
air so each state has their own set of
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
rules i will tell you i think new
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire has done a
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job at policing their own
 
04:27:50.469 --> 04:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
self and rewriting rules when they need
 
04:27:52.950 --> 04:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
to be written but when we
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
finished with the car and we signed that
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
statement at the end
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's our liability and that's that
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
person that works for me liability
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's his name that's his integrity on
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
that and when he signs that that car is
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
leaving safe it was a little bit a
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
statement a little while ago that a car
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
could be inspected and leave unsafe
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
if that inspection is done properly that
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
car is leaving
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
as safe
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
as it possibly could be
 
04:28:20.469 --> 04:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
under the rules of the state of new
 
04:28:21.990 --> 04:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so to answer your question yes
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
the rules between estates are totally
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
different um from state to state
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the inspection part of it
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
all right i might leave it with two it's
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh i always say it's the best deal on
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
main street
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
because uh you have a professional
 
04:28:40.159 --> 04:28:41.429 align:start position:0%
because uh you have a professional
technician

04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
technician
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
check your car over for a fee that is
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable to make sure that your family
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
is safe mr chairman members of the
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the time thank
 
04:28:50.399 --> 04:28:53.189 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the time thank
you

04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
next up
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
steve zemenek
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
hi my name's steve zamanick
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
i live in manchester and i'm here on my
 
04:29:17.110 --> 04:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.110 --> 04:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm an avid do-it-yourselfer i'm not a
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
professional mechanic
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
um but i i try to keep my vehicles in
 
04:29:26.469 --> 04:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
really good shape and on the road as
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
long as i can
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
it seems like every year uh
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
inspection time becomes like this
 
04:29:36.399 --> 04:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
inspection time becomes like this
anxiety

04:29:37.750 --> 04:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
anxiety
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh producing thing where uh
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know what i'm gonna get jerked
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
around on this year
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
i've gone in for you know and it was my
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to new hampshire when i moved
 
04:29:51.120 --> 04:29:52.469 align:start position:0%
welcome to new hampshire when i moved
from

04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where it just passed
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts inspection moved to new
 
04:29:56.239 --> 04:29:57.349 align:start position:0%
massachusetts inspection moved to new
hampshire

04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
and had a technician
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
if you can call him that
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
hammering on my rocker panels until he
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
finally made a hole and then said
 
04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
well you you have a rust hole and it's
 
04:30:09.910 --> 04:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to snap in half even though it was
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
a body-on-frame vehicle
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um it was very very thin sheet metal
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
that really wasn't structural
 
04:30:23.110 --> 04:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
and uh i found it uh very
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
04:30:25.760 --> 04:30:26.469 align:start position:0%
you know and
it

04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:30:28.950 --> 04:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
seemed really unnecessary
 
04:30:28.960 --> 04:30:33.349 align:start position:0%
seemed really unnecessary
um

04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
and it seems like every year
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's something that
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
uh i hear people get jerked around over
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with safety if
 
04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
you go through some of the regulations
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
there are things that uh don't even make
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
any sense for example you can't have too
 
04:30:50.640 --> 04:30:51.510 align:start position:0%
any sense for example you can't have too
many

04:30:51.510 --> 04:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:30:53.830 --> 04:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
forward facing headlights if you have
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
auxiliary headlights
 
04:30:56.399 --> 04:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
auxiliary headlights
where

04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
it would seem like if you're driving
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
down rural new hampshire windy roads you
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
want all the light you can so you don't
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.279 --> 04:31:09.269 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh i've i've had my vehicle fail
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
inspection for breaks
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
and uh i go to do it myself and take
 
04:31:19.510 --> 04:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
them off and they are well within the
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
the limit because they're just trying to
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
sell a brake job
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
plenty of other states
 
04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
don't have inspection plenty of other
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
states had inspections and got rid of
 
04:31:29.359 --> 04:31:31.030 align:start position:0%
states had inspections and got rid of
them

04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:31:32.790 --> 04:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
most canadian provinces don't have
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers
 
04:31:34.960 --> 04:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers
and

04:31:37.269 --> 04:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:37.279 --> 04:31:39.670 align:start position:0%
and
i

04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
i ended up working for a uh one of new
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire's largest car dealerships um
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
for about five years not as a technician
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
or anything but in the business back end
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
but i interacted with the people in the
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
service department and the parts
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
department on a regular basis and i
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
drove an old truck at the time
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
and everyone there kind of knew i worked
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
on my own stuff
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
and uh kept it on the road but
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
eventually got to the point where i
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
finally decided to buy a new vehicle
 
04:32:11.920 --> 04:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
finally decided to buy a new vehicle
um

04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i bought a one-year-old certified
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
pre-owned uh truck
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
um off the lot from them
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
from my from my former employer
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.800 --> 04:32:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
when i bought it one of the it had quite
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
a few miles on it in that one year
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
period but one of the things they told
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
me is we put new brakes on it all the
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
way around
 
04:32:38.080 --> 04:32:39.750 align:start position:0%
way around
okay

04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:39.760 --> 04:32:40.630 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:40.640 --> 04:32:42.469 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
a couple months after i buy it goes by
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it's my birthday again i need to
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
go get my inspection sticker
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
all right first time in my life i got a
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
new truck it's a warranty everything
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
should be fine it's got new brakes
 
04:32:59.670 --> 04:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh i get a call i'm up in my office i
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
get a call from the service advisor when
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
i dropped it off uh hey steve
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to need new brakes new
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
front brakes to pass inspection
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's funny
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
because i just bought this vehicle from
 
04:33:12.240 --> 04:33:12.949 align:start position:0%
because i just bought this vehicle from
you

04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
less than a year ago and one of the
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
things you told me was it had new breaks
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
all the way around so either you're
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
lying to me when i bought it or you're
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
lying to me now
 
04:33:23.520 --> 04:33:24.949 align:start position:0%
lying to me now
and

04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
i went down to the service and i
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know hung up the phone ran down the
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
stairs into the shop and and uh to
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
basically confront the mechanic or at
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
least see with my own eyes what's going
 
04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
on with my truck
 
04:33:37.840 --> 04:33:39.109 align:start position:0%
on with my truck
um

04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
as i'm walking in the door the
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
mechanic's putting the sticker on my
 
04:33:42.639 --> 04:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
mechanic's putting the sticker on my
truck

04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
truck
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and i say hey what's this i i hear i
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
need a new front brakes
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
and he goes oh i didn't say that he
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
he starts backpedaling and and say uh
 
04:34:02.070 --> 04:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
but your brakes are wearing unevenly
 
04:34:02.080 --> 04:34:03.189 align:start position:0%
but your brakes are wearing unevenly
and

04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:03.199 --> 04:34:04.310 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're probably not gonna last as long
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
as they should so you probably at your
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
next oil change you're gonna need a new
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
brake job
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah just keep an eye on it
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i figure well
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
brake pads have wear indicators
 
04:34:20.480 --> 04:34:21.590 align:start position:0%
brake pads have wear indicators
uh

04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know even if they're even if they go
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
if i can interrupt you it sounds like
 
04:34:28.230 --> 04:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
you've had a predatory experience i've
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
had multiple predatory experiences but
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
not necessarily now
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to excuse me excuse me i
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
just need you to
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
please get to the point of why we should
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
do this or not sure um
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you had a bad experience
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
i've had i've had multiple bad
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
experiences i've
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
so when i see when i hear like 15 of
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
vehicles are failing inspection every
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
year and a lot of it's because of brakes
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
i actually wonder if you go to your
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
mechanic and he says you need new brakes
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
did you really need new brakes
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
i don't want to throw my former employer
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
under the bus that's not not naming them
 
04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh because it might have just been an
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
honest miscommunication between a game
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
of telephone between the
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
mechanic and the service advisor and me
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
but they quoted me seven hundred dollars
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh to do the job so a year later when it
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
come to go do my next inspection sticker
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
i say well i'm gonna do my next um i'm
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
gonna do my next uh brake job before i
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
go for inspection sticker because
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
they're probably gonna jerk me around on
 
04:35:26.240 --> 04:35:27.269 align:start position:0%
they're probably gonna jerk me around on
it

04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
when i take my brakes off
 
04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are still plenty of pad left a
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
year after i was told i was going to
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
need to do breaks and i was like
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
if this is me and they know i work on my
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
own stuff
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
if they're pulling this with me
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
what are they pulling on someone's
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
grandma who doesn't know any better you
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
know are they selling her an unnecessary
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
brake job
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the other thing i've i've noticed
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there's really no
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
proper appeal process if your vehicle
 
04:35:58.629 --> 04:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
fails inspection and you think it should
 
04:35:58.639 --> 04:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
fails inspection and you think it should
um

04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
break jobs where you know or sorry uh
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
failures for breaks and then the the
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
pads are still good
 
04:36:12.240 --> 04:36:13.109 align:start position:0%
pads are still good
and

04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
nothing's really ever done with it
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's no appeal process all you can
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
kind of do is if someone says you need a
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
new brake job you've got to go do a new
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
brake job that's basically the only
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
this bill it would attack
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of the safety regulations when
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles go through inspection i saw
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
the many years that i work as a service
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
advisor there a lot of safety
 
04:37:40.869 --> 04:37:40.879 align:start position:0%
issues come through the service
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
department when people get inspection
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
we're not talking just brakes we're
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
talking about tires
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about body parts on the
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
vehicle they get rusted during the
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
winter time
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
we live in a new england area with
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
vehicles they get rostered very quickly
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
and i see i saw that a lot during the
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
many years that i worked as a service
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
advisor so for for that
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
reason and i know that we need to keep
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
our people and new hunters safe i'm here
 
04:38:14.949 --> 04:38:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thanks again
 
04:38:20.639 --> 04:38:24.789 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thanks again
um

04:38:24.789 --> 04:38:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go with
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
carl huddleston from the new hampshire
 
04:38:36.310 --> 04:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
state police in opposition to the bill
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
says you're looking for 10 minutes but
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
04:38:47.039 --> 04:38:48.789 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
committee

04:38:48.789 --> 04:38:48.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
i represent the department of safety and
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
we are in opposition of this proposed
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
basically um this is a safety inspection
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
and it's a minimum standard and the
 
04:39:04.150 --> 04:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
state standard
 
04:39:04.160 --> 04:39:05.029 align:start position:0%
state standard
for

04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:39:08.551 --> 04:39:08.561 align:start position:0%
both tire depth and uh friction material
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
on the brake is 230 seconds of an inch
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
which is a 16th of an inch um
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
given the weather today
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
a sixteenth of an inch of tread depth
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
probably would not let you get going on
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
the highway so this is a very minimum
 
04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's designed to keep people safe
 
04:39:32.310 --> 04:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
one thing that was noted before
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
was that
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
this would differentiate between a
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
commercial and non-commercial vehicle
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
and a statement was made that most
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles are registered to
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
accompany unfortunately that's not 100
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
correct there are many owner operators
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
that actually register the vehicle to
 
04:39:50.400 --> 04:39:52.628 align:start position:0%
that actually register the vehicle to
themselves

04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
maybe a change in administrative rule
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
indicating that
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to register a
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle to a business
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
um would have to be done i don't know
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
whether that's practical or not
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
um they could also use that to
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
circumvent the
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
inspection process on a commercial motor
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle so the bottom line is that
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is truly for everyone's safety not
 
04:40:21.270 --> 04:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
just the person driving the car but the
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's also a consumer protection issue
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle gets inspected uh when a vehicle
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
gets sold it sold either one of two ways
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
with a valid inspection sticker and a
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
20-day plate or with an unsafe vehicle
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
form so again this is one more layer of
 
04:40:39.120 --> 04:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
form so again this is one more layer of
protection

04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:40:40.240 --> 04:40:41.190 align:start position:0%
protection
for

04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
the consumer
 
04:40:42.958 --> 04:40:45.590 align:start position:0%
the consumer
um

04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
part of my duties
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years with the
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety is we've done
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
post collision inspections on vehicles
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
that have been involved in
 
04:40:55.760 --> 04:40:57.030 align:start position:0%
that have been involved in
crashes

04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
crashes
 
04:40:59.110 --> 04:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
and there have been a number of times
 
04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
where we have found
 
04:41:01.360 --> 04:41:03.030 align:start position:0%
where we have found
deficiencies

04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
04:41:04.628 --> 04:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
brake suspension
 
04:41:04.638 --> 04:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
brake suspension
steering

04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
steering
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
that caused crashes
 
04:41:08.878 --> 04:41:10.230 align:start position:0%
that caused crashes
again

04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
a state inspection annual state
 
04:41:12.000 --> 04:41:13.110 align:start position:0%
a state inspection annual state
inspection

04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
may have been able to pick up on those
 
04:41:15.440 --> 04:41:16.708 align:start position:0%
may have been able to pick up on those
deficiencies

04:41:16.708 --> 04:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
04:41:16.718 --> 04:41:19.350 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
beforehand

04:41:19.350 --> 04:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
beforehand
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
i would gladly answer any questions
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
04:41:23.360 --> 04:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
seeing them thanks again thank you
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
next up chair recognizes and i apologize
 
04:41:33.190 --> 04:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
the printing is so small
 
04:41:34.470 --> 04:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh kenneth
 
04:41:34.480 --> 04:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
uh kenneth
rounty

04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
and before you get started it says
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking for 15 minutes
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
in all fairness i just
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
the average i have here is three to five
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:41:57.040 --> 04:41:58.470 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:41:58.470 --> 04:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
so we heard a testimony in support of
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that gave us a lot of data
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
showing that uh
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
there really doesn't appear to be a
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
relationship between the lack of state
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
inspections in a state and
 
04:42:11.200 --> 04:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
inspections in a state and
the

04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
dangers on the road
 
04:42:13.920 --> 04:42:15.110 align:start position:0%
dangers on the road
um

04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm a data person i think that we should
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
listen to data first and foremost
 
04:42:20.160 --> 04:42:21.030 align:start position:0%
listen to data first and foremost
um

04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
but if anecdotal evidence you know helps
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
i can give some of that as well
 
04:42:25.920 --> 04:42:26.708 align:start position:0%
i can give some of that as well
so

04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
i have an incentive to be
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
against this bill um because i i also am
 
04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
a mechanic
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
um not ase master certified yet but i'm
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
only three tests away i haven't failed
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.160 --> 04:42:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.948 --> 04:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of horror stories
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
emotional horror stories about
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
people who didn't know their vehicles
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
were in disrepair and they were
 
04:42:53.830 --> 04:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
discovered at the point of inspection
 
04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
but what you're not hearing is
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
we see those vehicles every day even if
 
04:42:59.430 --> 04:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
they're not coming in for inspection
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
mechanics have an incentive
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
when you go for an oil change to look
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
through your car and tell you if there's
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
something wrong because they want the
 
04:43:06.798 --> 04:43:08.628 align:start position:0%
something wrong because they want the
business

04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
so that's the answer to your question
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
sir you asked earlier
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
about would would we miss these things
 
04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have state inspections i
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't think so um
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
yeah your average person is a mechanic
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
but they still go for an oil change and
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know to a mechanic who's going to
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
look through their vehicle and and
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know let's be honest try to find
 
04:43:29.680 --> 04:43:31.190 align:start position:0%
you know let's be honest try to find
work

04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:43:31.200 --> 04:43:32.550 align:start position:0%
work
um

04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:32.560 --> 04:43:35.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
between the data and the fact that you
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
know on a day-to-day basis you see these
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles whether or not they're coming
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
in for inspect inspections you're
 
04:43:44.830 --> 04:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
finding these problems
 
04:43:44.840 --> 04:43:46.788 align:start position:0%
finding these problems
um

04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't see a reason why this
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.560 --> 04:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
also you do have some people who are
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
malicious with inspections or or
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
even people who interpret the the rules
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
differently the state wants us to
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
inspect vehicles the same way every
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle gets inspected the same way but
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
the truth is different mechanics you
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
know apply their own spin to uh you know
 
04:44:13.510 --> 04:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
the rules and they don't necessarily
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
follow them to a tee
 
04:44:15.840 --> 04:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
follow them to a tee
um

04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen cars get that that were failed
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
brake pads that that shouldn't have been
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
failed they don't meet the requirement
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:44:28.560 --> 04:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
that the
and

04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
when you tell a customer that their
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
brakes are bad they definitely they want
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
to get it done
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
they don't want to drive in a vehicle
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's unsafe
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
so if they don't have the means to check
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
for themselves i'm sorry let me let me
 
04:44:48.868 --> 04:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
the horror stories that we're hearing
 
04:44:51.680 --> 04:44:56.070 align:start position:0%
the horror stories that we're hearing
um

04:44:56.070 --> 04:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
the one thing that they have in common
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
is because they didn't know
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and they just happened to be noticed
 
04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
at the point of inspection again they
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
could have been noticed during an oil
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
change or any other routine care
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
um but also
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
they all wanted to get it done they were
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
horrified when they heard that their
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
brakes were in disrepair or there was
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
some other issue with their vehicle they
 
04:45:17.910 --> 04:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think the reason that there
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
is no data showing
 
04:45:20.718 --> 04:45:22.150 align:start position:0%
is no data showing
that

04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:23.830 --> 04:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
state inspections make a difference in
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
terms of safety on the road is because
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
when people
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
hear that their vehicles and safe they
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
genuinely want to fix it
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
you tell a mother who comes in with her
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know her kids your vehicle's in
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
disrepair during an oil change and she's
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
just as likely to get it done as if it
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
were a state inspection
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that's essentially
 
04:45:42.788 --> 04:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
all i have to say
 
04:45:49.350 --> 04:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%

um

04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things i just want to bring
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
up that's not in my testimony because
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
you keep hearing data
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
i was lucky enough this past two years
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be invited to sit in on first of all
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
i was included
 
04:47:10.560 --> 04:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
i was included
via

04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
via
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%

04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
i now have a seat on that i was also
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
invited to be on the highway
 
04:47:20.798 --> 04:47:21.910 align:start position:0%
invited to be on the highway

04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
almost 24 hours of being on that with
 
04:47:27.520 --> 04:47:28.628 align:start position:0%
almost 24 hours of being on that with
engineers

04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the crash data what we found out
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
just recently there's a lot of it that
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
has and it's it's not no one's fault but
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reporting of crash data
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
that has holes in it there's a lot of
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
missing pieces to that
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
so in that crash data there's a lot of
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
things that we're finding
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's missing are the mechanical pieces
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
so as you hear crash data crash data we
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
are missing crash data that is a
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
component of this with that whole
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical side
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're finding it with the motorcyclist
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
that's important to me but also with
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles so something you might want to
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
think about
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
we did hear that we are talking about it
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
and how to deal with that on that
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%

04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that's something that they do y'all
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
are probably familiar with it
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
where we plan for the next five years
 
04:48:20.788 --> 04:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do with the roads
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire it was an awesome
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
thing to sit in on and be part of and
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
very honor very honored to be able to be
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
the motorcyclist to sit in on that thank
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
you for letting me say that
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
the last time that an industry survey
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
was done
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
where motorcycle inspection failure was
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
looked at it was 30 to 40 percent
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
we feel as an organization that's a big
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
failure rate for motorcyclists
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
how a rider rides a motorcycle and if
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're not a motorcyclist
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
you might not understand this but how a
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
rider rides their motorcycle
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
is a big component of how a back tire
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
wears out
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
how much weight
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
a rider carries on their motorcycle is a
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
big component
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
of how a back tire wears
 
04:49:13.350 --> 04:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
i know you're aware of our season up
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
here is short
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
we have motorcycles that sit all year
 
04:49:20.788 --> 04:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
long or not all year half of a year
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
before we can get on them and ride
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's a chemistry part of how that tire
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
might be once we get on them a ride in
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
the springtime
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of riders that get on that
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and if we didn't have an
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
inspection would never look at their
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
tires would never look at their brakes
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
nor would they know how to measure that
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
tire tread depth
 
04:49:43.590 --> 04:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
or look at their brakes to figure out if
 
04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're okay and would get on that
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and ride
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of motorcyclists in this state
 
04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
ride a couple thousand miles
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of them ride
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
30 to 45 000 miles in our short season
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
big difference
 
04:50:03.670 --> 04:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
but all of them still should have their
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycles inspected
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of new riders we have we
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
have almost 80 000 registered
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
motorcycles in our wonderful small
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
little state
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of new riders in this
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
state most of them have no clue how to
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
work on their motorcycles much less how
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
to look at what they're doing with their
 
04:50:23.600 --> 04:50:24.868 align:start position:0%
to look at what they're doing with their
motorcycles

04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
04:50:26.150 --> 04:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's important to us as an
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
organization as well which is another
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
reason that we believe their motorcycle
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
should be inspected this is not old
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
school bikers these are new guys that
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
get on again their motorcycles and never
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
look at their tires
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
huge component for us we only have two
 
04:50:41.520 --> 04:50:42.948 align:start position:0%
huge component for us we only have two
wheels

04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
wheels
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
when we're on the road with other
 
04:50:50.000 --> 04:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
when we're on the road with other
vehicles

04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
we want to know that their tires and
 
04:50:55.750 --> 04:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
their brakes are safe obviously
 
04:50:57.910 --> 04:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
if i'm riding by two vehicles right here
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
or one in front of me
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
i want to know if they put on their
 
04:51:01.280 --> 04:51:02.310 align:start position:0%
i want to know if they put on their
brakes

04:51:02.310 --> 04:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
brakes
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
that their brakes are going to work i
 
04:51:06.390 --> 04:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
don't want them their tires to go and
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
take me out
 
04:51:10.868 --> 04:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
another component for us is motorcyclist
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was mentioned in
 
04:51:12.240 --> 04:51:13.190 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was mentioned in
this

04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:51:15.270 --> 04:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
was the physical note or the physical
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
note sorry that southern accent comes
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
out that fiscal note i've been with you
 
04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.550 --> 04:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
i know that someone says you can make up
 
04:51:26.560 --> 04:51:27.510 align:start position:0%
i know that someone says you can make up
that

04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
720 i think it is there's another
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
what is it 86 000 i think that goes to
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
so it's really 800 000
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's got to come from somewhere
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
but that component on our roads is
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
important to us as motorcyclists because
 
04:51:45.760 --> 04:51:46.788 align:start position:0%
important to us as motorcyclists because
probably

04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
even more
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
than the cars
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
really good road conditions affect
 
04:51:52.878 --> 04:51:54.628 align:start position:0%
really good road conditions affect
motorcyclists

04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
if the roads are are not so great i know
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
in the the state because we've met with
 
04:51:58.878 --> 04:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the the state because we've met with
them

04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
they use that crack sealant we call them
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
road snakes
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
to repair their roads to make them last
 
04:52:05.520 --> 04:52:06.708 align:start position:0%
to repair their roads to make them last
longer

04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
longer
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's very dangerous to us as
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists so if we're going to take
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
away some of that money
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
they may use that more
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's tough for us
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
so we want to keep that money
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to our roads to make them safer
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
and lastly i want to leave you on the
 
04:52:24.310 --> 04:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
back page you've got something i want
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
you to know
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
as an organization we're serious about
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
you've got our ride smart program
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we started
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
we incorporated it with the new
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire highway of safety
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
we brought in the writer's education
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
program we brought in new hampshire
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
automobile dealers association aaa the
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%

04:52:47.760 --> 04:52:48.708 align:start position:0%
iheart media
and

04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
we started a task force just for this
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of looking at how motorcyclists
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
are affected in this state what we could
 
04:52:57.750 --> 04:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
do to do better how to educate
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists and what was important
 
04:53:00.000 --> 04:53:01.590 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists and what was important
motorcyclists

04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists
 
04:53:03.990 --> 04:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
keeping the inspection is important to
 
04:53:04.000 --> 04:53:05.190 align:start position:0%
keeping the inspection is important to
us

04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:53:09.280 --> 04:53:10.708 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
if you'll take any
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know is he nice
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
my wife thinks so
 
04:53:16.718 --> 04:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
my wife thinks so
okay

04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
testifying today i got a quick question
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
for you in your notes here you mentioned
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycle inspection failure rate of 30
 
04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
to 40 percent
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
and you've mentioned you know tires and
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
brakes what are the things
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
um is causing some of the failure rates
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
in motorcycles
 
04:53:38.550 --> 04:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
so dan bennett is going to speak more to
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
that that's i mean and i work very very
 
04:53:42.550 --> 04:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
much with those guys he'll he can give
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
you more of that detail um i can tell
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
you from our organization again tires
 
04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
and brakes are the biggest the biggest
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
two components for us especially the
 
04:53:53.670 --> 04:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
back tire and it's just because of how
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
how we ride
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
and it and again it depends on every
 
04:53:59.430 --> 04:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
rider is different you get the hardcore
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
writer i'm sure you've seen those some
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the ones that we try to get on the
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
ride like they shouldn't ride
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then you get the you get the full
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
dressers that fully dress them that have
 
04:54:12.390 --> 04:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
all of the components to them they've
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
got the wife on the back or maybe the
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
husband on the back i don't know
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
and it's what all that weight with what
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
they're doing and all the mileage that
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
they put and what they do on the road
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
how many miles they go that's going to
 
04:54:26.550 --> 04:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
wear that tire out a lot more for us
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's more about the tire and the
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
braking systems and with the newer bikes
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
even with all the newer bikes that
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
they've got with the abs brakes and that
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
type of thing there's still more of that
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to be inspected for us uh
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to the controls and
 
04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
the newer bikes that that need to get my
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
my husband's newer motorcycle one of his
 
04:54:48.628 --> 04:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
motorcycles he's got three um lost a
 
04:54:50.550 --> 04:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
sensor that he didn't know about we're
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
on the bike and all of a sudden going up
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
a hill the sensor let go and it went
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
room and we almost went backwards down
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
the hill because of it the inspection
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
would have caught that but
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
for us it happened to be that we got on
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
it before we had the inspection
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
not something we do anymore
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
so things like that are important thank
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you committee and chairman
 
04:55:22.080 --> 04:55:22.948 align:start position:0%
thank you committee and chairman
uh

04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%

04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
the committee i will not take my full
 
04:55:42.628 --> 04:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
five minutes after all the testimony
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
i've heard today just to provide some
 
04:55:45.750 --> 04:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
data that we pulled out of our
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
inspection system on wednesday for
 
04:55:50.708 --> 04:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
today's proceedings
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
so to answer one of the questions that
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier what are the
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
percentages of things that's what we
 
04:55:55.750 --> 04:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
have here today
 
04:55:57.190 --> 04:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i pulled five years worth of
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
inspection data out and it's a 15
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
average for a failure rate so if you can
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
imagine 1.5 million
 
04:56:08.788 --> 04:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
inspections done in 2021 and 217
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
881 violations found and violations
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
again to go back to the earlier
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard today
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
are minimum skill sets i mean they're
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
minimum rather
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
minimum sets here i mean 230 seconds is
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
a failure and tires and brakes
 
04:56:27.270 --> 04:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
are number one number two categories so
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
five years worth of data 15
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
failure rate on average
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
and i can certainly pass this out if
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
anybody's interested to see that as well
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
but this did come from our system
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
last wednesday
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:56:40.480 --> 04:56:42.628 align:start position:0%
any questions
well

04:56:42.628 --> 04:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
you said 15 failure rate over five years
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
the average is what you said okay follow
 
04:56:55.040 --> 04:56:57.110 align:start position:0%
the average is what you said okay follow
up

04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
how many vehicles inspected over that
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
time you gave a figure and i didn't get
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
it i'm gonna pass that out for you oh uh
 
04:57:05.990 --> 04:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
you can have it i brought enough copies
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
for everybody but to answer the question
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh 1 million 524 thousand 758 vehicles
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
inspected 1.5 217
 
04:57:18.330 --> 04:57:18.340 align:start position:0%
881 failures for a 14.29
 
04:57:18.340 --> 04:57:19.510 align:start position:0%
881 failures for a 14.29
[Music]

04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
failure rate
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it goes back to
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh again goes back five years ago and we
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
were at 16 and a half percent
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
um in 2017.
 
04:57:32.550 --> 04:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:57:43.510 --> 04:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh last person i have signed up to speak
 
04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
dan bennett
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire auto
 
04:57:49.750 --> 04:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
dealers association opposed to the bill
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee i will be brief um it's almost
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
as bad as being the last speaker before
 
04:58:17.110 --> 04:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
lunch i guess so um i will hit a couple
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
points very briefly i'll do my best to
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
not repeat any that have already been
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
said by some of the speakers before um
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
and i will answer uh some of the
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
questions that i've heard as well
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as possible so again dan
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
bennett new hampshire automobile dealers
 
04:58:33.030 --> 04:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
association uh thank you for your time
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
today uh we are a trade association
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
representing over 500 businesses in new
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire um in the motor vehicle
 
04:58:39.600 --> 04:58:40.708 align:start position:0%
hampshire um in the motor vehicle
industry

04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
both franchise and independent
 
04:58:43.360 --> 04:58:45.270 align:start position:0%
both franchise and independent
businesses

04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:58:45.280 --> 04:58:45.990 align:start position:0%
businesses
so

04:58:45.990 --> 04:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:48.868 --> 04:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to hb1426 as we have been
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
04:58:51.830 --> 04:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
over multiple years
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
this bill has or this similar concept
 
04:58:56.550 --> 04:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
has been heard by this committee and it
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
has been wisely voted down one of the
 
04:59:00.550 --> 04:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
most recent times it was defeated by the
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
full house 258 to 70. so
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's always been strong support
 
04:59:08.550 --> 04:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
against this issue in both this
 
04:59:12.550 --> 04:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee room and the house as well
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
a few things that we've heard about data
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen the data that
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative conley has referred to
 
04:59:20.550 --> 04:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
but we certainly can you provide you
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
some of the data that we look at
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
some of the federal data um so nitsa did
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
a study that looked at vehicle crashes
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
and said mechanical defects
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
are an aggravating factor in over 12.6
 
04:59:35.670 --> 04:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
percent of crashes
 
04:59:38.550 --> 04:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
that means about 850 000 crashes per
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
year could be avoided
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the pennsylvania d.o.t recently did a
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
study back in 2009 and they said the
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania annual program um
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
has reduced the number of fatal crashes
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
by 115 to 169
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
save it which translates to saving uh
 
04:59:58.948 --> 04:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
127 to 187 lives so if this program has
 
05:00:01.270 --> 05:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
proved to save even one life i think
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's a value um it's a good program
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
and it's a really big ask to hope that
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
people do inspections
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
so um this this program seems to work
 
05:00:14.070 --> 05:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance costs way less
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
than catastrophic repair
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
a brake job costs 300 bucks a front end
 
05:00:20.550 --> 05:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
after that break and ball joint
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
component failure cost 3000 so this
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
annual check
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually saves citizens money through
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance
 
05:00:30.070 --> 05:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
all of our neighboring states have
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
inspections massachusetts maine vermont
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
we heard about states that have dropped
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
their inspection programs
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
i heard the example of new jersey i'll
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
mention this new jersey dropped their
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
program in 2010
 
05:00:44.550 --> 05:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
in a in a budget crisis because it was a
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
state-run program done through unionized
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
labor work that cost the state
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to administrate it's
 
05:00:56.230 --> 05:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
not a free it was not a free market
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
program like new hampshire's is so they
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't really be compared um they're
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
really they're apples to oranges mr
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
oberdink did a spectacular job with the
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
data talking about the 15 percent we
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
have some um
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
some some of that same data and we
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
included in our handout for you all to
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
see um there's some things going to
 
05:01:14.788 --> 05:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
refer to in the handout that i sent
 
05:01:14.798 --> 05:01:15.590 align:start position:0%
refer to in the handout that i sent
around

05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
like visuals
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
but i would mention this that failure
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
rate of 15 is likely and at least 15
 
05:01:24.788 --> 05:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
that is the floor
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
because in a lot of cases when a vehicle
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
fails the technician finds it they talk
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
to the vehicle owner the owner says i
 
05:01:34.390 --> 05:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
have bad tires go ahead fix them
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
they don't fail me
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
then pass me after i've done it they let
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
me know they go ahead and fix the item
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then the vehicle serves as a pass so
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
that at that 15 is an at least number um
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think there's there's an issue
 
05:01:53.190 --> 05:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
was discussed about uh you know personal
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
versus commercial vehicles um so again
 
05:01:57.670 --> 05:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point to that handout that
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
you see there okay
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's a picture of a subaru wagon
 
05:02:03.030 --> 05:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
there got a nice trailer hitch pull a
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
camper rocket box to throw skis in a lot
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
of stickers on it kids favorite sports
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
team and stuff like that
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement there is absolutely
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
no way to know that that vehicle is
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
owned by the new hampshire automobile
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
dealers association working compensation
 
05:02:15.040 --> 05:02:16.310 align:start position:0%
dealers association working compensation
trust

05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
trust
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
the potential for fraud or uninspected
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles that will be on the road that
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
will be unenforceable by law enforcement
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
can be problematic
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
because there'll be no check
 
05:02:25.440 --> 05:02:26.628 align:start position:0%
because there'll be no check
so

05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard from other people that are
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
agree with us that they are opposed to
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
this this bill there's others like the
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire traffic safety commission
 
05:02:34.160 --> 05:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire traffic safety commission
aaa

05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
aaa
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
and you've heard some from some some of
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
those other folks
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
one important component to the safety
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
inspection program that is automatically
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
done through the the software and the
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
program that does it is that when your
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle is inspected it receives a
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
federal safety recall check
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
through the national highway
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
transportation safety agency this is a
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
new component that was added into the
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
system when the last contract was
 
05:02:59.440 --> 05:03:01.350 align:start position:0%
system when the last contract was
reviewed

05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
between june of 2021 and november 2021
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
so just a few months
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
this program alerted citizens to over a
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy two thousand open
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
safety recalls
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
and those recalls are covered by the
 
05:03:17.110 --> 05:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer they're not out of the
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
pocket of the citizens so there's a real
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
again i'll go back to my handout you'll
 
05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
see a little map there okay
 
05:03:30.070 --> 05:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
because i'd like to talk apples to
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
apples about new hampshire and our
 
05:03:31.440 --> 05:03:35.270 align:start position:0%
apples about new hampshire and our
climate

05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is a a
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
a map that looks at winter severity and
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
if you look at new england you see we're
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
we're we're nuclear red so you can't
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
compare us to other states like florida
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
arizona california okay but then some of
 
05:03:49.270 --> 05:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
the states that i even heard from the
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative was ohio washington
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
michigan and if you look at it
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
we have much more severe
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
winters than other states that's why new
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
england has a microclimate all have
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
annual inspections because it's good for
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
the micro climate that we live in
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
i drove home last night about 8 30 and
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know what they were doing spraying
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the roads right before the
 
05:04:13.430 --> 05:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
temperature dropped they were spraying
 
05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
liquid salt water on the roads
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's not a practice that's done
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
in a whole lot of other places when that
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
gets into the undercarriage of vehicles
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the damage that it's done i think
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
you heard from an earlier speaker about
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
um frame damage and corrosion so um
 
05:04:32.230 --> 05:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's a a a very different climate and i
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
think this map this data kind of proves
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
that so um
 
05:04:40.150 --> 05:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
with that being the end of the prepared
 
05:04:42.708 --> 05:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
testimony that i have for you um i just
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
like to answer some of the questions or
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the things i heard
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
very very briefly um representative
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
o'hara to your question
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
the government mandates plenty of
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
inspections done by the private sector
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
such as elevators boilers fire
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
extinguishers gas pumps and don't get me
 
05:05:01.110 --> 05:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
started on airplanes okay
 
05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
um so i think that one um representative
 
05:05:06.390 --> 05:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
gorski uh your question about failures a
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the failure items on motorcycles
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
are pretty similar uh brakes tires
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
suspensions and lighting um
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
the one issue that does uh deviate from
 
05:05:15.360 --> 05:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
the one issue that does uh deviate from
that

05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
is motorcycle sound
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
for any of you have been around this
 
05:05:21.670 --> 05:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
room for a while you know we're not
 
05:05:23.670 --> 05:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to call it motorcycle noise it's
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
motorcycle sound so there is a decibel
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
level check done on motorcycles
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're below a
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
certain level and that's a common
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
failure item because motorcycles are so
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
i heard a comment about we'll catch
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
these things during oil changes
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
at an oil change you do not pull tires
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
you do not aim headlights uh you don't
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
measure ball joint gauges at the frame
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
and suspension connection so um
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
these things are
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very different review and
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
then the last thing that i'll mention is
 
05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
i heard about this no there's no appeal
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
process if there's a safety inspection
 
05:06:04.560 --> 05:06:05.990 align:start position:0%
process if there's a safety inspection
failure

05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
failure
 
05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not the case the safety
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
inspection failure is a notification
 
05:06:12.390 --> 05:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have to hold someone there and
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
they can't leave and you're keeping
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
their keys unless they fix it and
 
05:06:17.350 --> 05:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to leave it's not a
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
hostage situation um it's a it's a
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
safety failure notification okay and
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
then there's troop g and the state
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
police and their team of automotive
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
equipment inspectors
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
that in instances of that uh you know
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
alleged violation or a grievance
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for coming down
 
05:06:39.030 --> 05:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
reviewing inspecting and investigating
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
whether that is a valid claim or not so
 
05:06:42.550 --> 05:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
there is a process through the state
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
police through their troop g to review
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
instances like that so um
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
those are the um
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
the only items that i wanted to address
 
05:06:54.310 --> 05:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
from previous testimony
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
and then if there are any questions
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to see if i can
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative mancha putin
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair a quick question in
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
terms of um
 
05:07:12.470 --> 05:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
when an insp
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle fails the safety inspection is
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
there a time frame within which or do
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
assess it based on the severity of the
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
safety concern
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
if it's a minor
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
you have this longer is there a set
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
process for that
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the rep question
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh no there is no graded
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
scale or hierarchy that says uh a window
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
chip needs to be done in five and a horn
 
05:07:40.628 --> 05:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be done in ten they're all
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
treated the same the the thirteen basic
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
safety related mechanical items that are
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
inspected all have the same time frame
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up missed
 
05:07:50.320 --> 05:07:51.910 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up missed
follow-up

05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:07:51.920 --> 05:07:52.708 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
is there a time frame so for every the
 
05:07:57.430 --> 05:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
13-point inspection
 
05:08:00.788 --> 05:08:00.798 align:start position:0%

the inspections are done within the
 
05:08:04.948 --> 05:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
birth month of the
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
individual and i believe
 
05:08:07.680 --> 05:08:08.628 align:start position:0%
individual and i believe
they

05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:08:11.830 --> 05:08:11.840 align:start position:0%

incorrect but
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%

05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
10 days into the next month and then
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%

05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
that this does not include recreational
 
05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%

05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
minimal uh
 
05:49:54.718 --> 05:49:56.230 align:start position:0%
minimal uh
version

05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
version
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
which still allows them to use first
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
class mail clarifying
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
the address
 
05:50:04.230 --> 05:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
that puts the onus on the driver that
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
they need to update their address with
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
the division of motor vehicles but it
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
also um
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
requires that a default order shall be
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
served in hand so that there can't be
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
the misunderstanding
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that clears up some of the
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions that we had yep thank you it
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
seems like we struck a good balance any
 
05:50:25.590 --> 05:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:50:29.910 --> 05:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
do the amendment with a voice vote uh
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of amendment zero
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
five zero eight h signify by saying aye
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
aye opposed nay
 
05:50:38.000 --> 05:50:38.868 align:start position:0%
aye opposed nay
okay

05:50:38.868 --> 05:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment is adopted
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh motion on the floor now is ought to
 
05:50:46.390 --> 05:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
pass as amended on 12 39 anybody cared
 
05:50:50.548 --> 05:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:52.868 --> 05:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none representative
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak in favor of the motion
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
as ought to pass as amended it's um what
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
i would characterize as a reasonable
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
compromise um and that it
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
it also has the further balance of
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of the individual
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
for a fair
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
fair process
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
and as i said i agree completely with
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
nothing else i'll ask the clerk to call

recommendation about the pass is amended
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
as approved 19-0 i already heard consent
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
by representative gagne is there a
 
05:52:16.400 --> 05:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
by representative gagne is there a
second

05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:20.470 --> 05:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative thompson any
 
05:52:23.190 --> 05:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
objection to consent yeah just a
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
question for the chair isn't it usually
 
05:52:28.310 --> 05:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
the when there's an fn
 
05:52:30.548 --> 05:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
uh depends on the value of it okay and
 
05:52:33.030 --> 05:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
what we usually do here is at least give
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
our wishes to the clerk if he tells me
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong and it has to go on the
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
regular calendar so be it
 
05:52:40.708 --> 05:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying yeah but i
 
05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
believe most of the
 
05:52:44.390 --> 05:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes that were large enough have
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
already been disposed of as early bills
 
05:52:49.830 --> 05:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
so this could go either way
 
05:52:49.840 --> 05:52:51.110 align:start position:0%
so this could go either way
[Music]

05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
so i'll close the executive session on
 
05:52:54.390 --> 05:52:54.400 align:start position:0%

care to speak to your motion
 
05:53:43.030 --> 05:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh on line seven of this bill
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
it says that the changes a defendant
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
shall be presumed to have been served
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
three days after mailing of the notice
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
i don't like the word presumed
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.948 --> 05:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
you can't presume anything
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
you know you're assuming that something
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
has been done it may not have been done
 
05:54:02.558 --> 05:54:03.750 align:start position:0%
has been done it may not have been done
therefore

05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:11.750 --> 05:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak to the itl on
 
05:54:13.350 --> 05:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
12 40.
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative sex
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
so it might not escape the notice of
 
05:54:19.350 --> 05:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
some people that i actually was the
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill but when i
 
05:54:24.390 --> 05:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
signed off on this bill as a co-sponsor
 
05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
i would just venture to say that the
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
post office then in the post office now
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
is two very different things
 
05:54:31.360 --> 05:54:32.548 align:start position:0%
is two very different things
and

05:54:32.548 --> 05:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
based on that i'm willing to support the
 
05:54:37.270 --> 05:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
itl motion
 
05:54:39.750 --> 05:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else wish to speak
 
05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i agree with
 
05:54:46.628 --> 05:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
representative sykes even though you see
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
my name on the bill a thing that's
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
happening to me right now
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
i mailed a package to a guy in attleboro
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i probably could have
 
05:54:56.948 --> 05:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
driven it there in two or three hours
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks later now he knows it was
 
05:55:01.350 --> 05:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
coming because i emailed him and told
 
05:55:02.948 --> 05:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
him it was coming and he even gave him a
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
tracking number and he still hasn't
 
05:55:06.948 --> 05:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
gotten it and the post office told him
 
05:55:09.270 --> 05:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
well wait another week and if it doesn't
 
05:55:11.430 --> 05:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
show up then have the sender put in a
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
claim we can't have a presumption of
 
05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
three days if it was three months i
 
05:55:18.548 --> 05:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
might go for it
 
05:55:23.430 --> 05:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith and as

05:55:39.270 --> 05:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
point out that the person that made the
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%

that was the old post office
 
05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%

05:59:31.840 --> 05:59:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:35.350 --> 05:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
so this is where we're at
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
i did schedule
 
05:59:41.670 --> 05:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
house bills 1463 1666 fn and 1093
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
for today but we're not going to be
 
05:59:46.470 --> 05:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
taking them up today
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
we've actually been working very hard
 
05:59:49.910 --> 05:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
here in committee we're ahead of
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
schedule comfortably
 
05:59:53.270 --> 05:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
i think we deserve to get out of here at
 
05:59:55.750 --> 05:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
a reasonable hour for a change
 
05:59:55.760 --> 05:59:56.948 align:start position:0%
a reasonable hour for a change
um

05:59:56.948 --> 05:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:58.868 --> 05:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
i had mentioned last week the plans that
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
i had were to take the week of well next
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
tuesday the 15th off because we're going
 
06:00:05.110 --> 06:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
to be in session for two days or a day
 
06:00:06.470 --> 06:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
and then then schedule the remainder
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
remaining four bills
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the 22nd that has not changed
 
06:00:16.548 --> 06:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
because i'm uncertain of how many people
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to have at that last
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
hearing we're going to go into some sort
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
of executive session but i don't know if
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be long enough for us to finish
 
06:00:24.788 --> 06:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
them all
 
06:00:26.470 --> 06:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
we probably will be stuck coming back
 
06:00:28.150 --> 06:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
one more day to do
 
06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
housekeeping basically on any bills we
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
haven't exact yet there is also one more
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
moving part and that's a senate bill
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's being fast-tracked our way which
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
i heard
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to be receiving on the 22nd
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
which would mean i couldn't schedule it
 
06:00:45.670 --> 06:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
to hear it on the 22nd anyway so i think
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
our our our hand has already been played
 
06:00:49.430 --> 06:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
for us that we're going to need another
 
06:00:49.440 --> 06:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
for us that we're going to need another
day

06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
they're in there in our there's our
 
06:00:56.150 --> 06:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
mop-up day for any uh executive sessions
 
06:00:57.890 --> 06:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
a perfect plan
 
06:00:57.900 --> 06:01:02.070 align:start position:0%
a perfect plan
[Laughter]

06:01:02.070 --> 06:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:04.070 --> 06:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
no next week we're not going to meet
 
06:01:06.788 --> 06:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
um we met we we we got all our early
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
bills done we're ahead of schedule
 
06:01:10.470 --> 06:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
comfortably with only four bills
 
06:01:12.150 --> 06:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
remaining about five
 
06:01:12.160 --> 06:01:12.868 align:start position:0%
remaining about five
so

06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:14.470 --> 06:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
we'll stop here tonight
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i'll see you in manchester next week
 
06:04:37.990 --> 06:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:38.000 --> 06:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
you
