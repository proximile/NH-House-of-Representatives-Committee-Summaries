you members of the committee it's I'm
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
glad to be back in house Ways and Means
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
my first committee when I served in the
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
House Representatives was here in the
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
house uh on ways and means so 4:32 uh an
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
old topic up for with the new bill um
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
Advanced deposit wagering this is
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
basically betting on horses um the
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
ability to do you know go bed on the
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Derby uh online um this bill
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
has a different wrinkle to it while it's
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
unclear at the Attorney General's office
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
whether this was legal or not legal and
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
the bill was originally brought forward
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
the request to lottery in the Attorney
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
General's office um last year and we ran
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
into some headaches and so we re
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
rejiggered it and made it look different
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
and brought it back um this bill uh
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
establishes that that uh process would
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
be legal um require that people get
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
licensed to be able to provide those
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
Services those licensed entities would
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
would pay um a tax on the handle um that
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
tax would go to Lottery um in the in the
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
new Wrinkle in this bill um in keeping
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
with the theme that I've heard from this
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee on over and over again
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is about charitable
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
gaming it's about Charities so what this
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to do is without trying to uh
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
create a huge amount of workload for the
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
lottery division where the bill would
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
take the revenue which is estimated a
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
little over $200 million a year uh 200
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
sorry $200,000 a year2 200 million
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
dollar we talking about a different
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
thing um but 200 million $200,000 a year
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
um allow Lottery to pick a a third party
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
intermediary non for-profit to be able
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
to manage that that money and issue
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
grants to Charities within the state who
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
don't currently participate in
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming um for whatever reason
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're on weit lists or whether
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
they just never applied for it before
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
would have allowed so in in the vision
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
is that we would have somebody like the
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
center for nonprofits that knows
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
Charities across the entire state to
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
administer this program receive Grant
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
requests and then issue the grants out
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
and complete a report back to the uh
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
Lottery to to show how all the money was
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
spent what charities got the money what
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the money was that's the
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
Bild of a nutshell happy to take
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
you do we have questions yes
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
representative ducet
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
question you you referenced uh it was
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
190 I don't remember the number from
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
last year okay came out of this
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
itl uh I think it was 154 voice voted on
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
the floor and you said you jiggered this
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
one the jiggering I see is you've
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
changed it from the monies going to
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
instead of the education trust fund it's
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
to some extra party for distribution for
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
Charities what else has changed in
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
anything just tax rate is different as
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
well okay the tax rate is in alignment
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
with so again under re I'm going to use
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
the word retail although I don't know if
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's the right word Charlie you'll
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but but the OTB
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
we currently have now off track betting
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
that we currently have now you can go to
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
the brook and place a bet on a horse
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
race has a tax rate this put the tax
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
rate for this and the tax rate for that
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
in alignment so in in the old bill that
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
was not true the tax rate was tax rates
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
were different so this puts the bill in
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
alignment with current tax rate that are
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
charg for the OTP or the off track
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
betting on horses that we do now at the
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
brook follow up follow up so the current
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
tax rate is dictated by RSA 284 and
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's only one entity in the state
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's licensed and maybe I can ask
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
Lottery about this one entity which is
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
the brook that can take simulcast
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
wagering legally in New Hampshire right
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
now that is my understanding although I
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
think they're two eligible only one
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
actually has one okay I've I've
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
heard I've heard uh many an argument
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
about this being a gray area with the
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
interstate racing act or whatever um my
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
contention is and my understanding of
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
the law at least New Hampshire state law
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
law is you have to uh hold a license and
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
and I think the federal statute I did
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
some notes and some
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
research and let me State this the
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
interstate horse racing act deems a
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
wager on horse horse racing across state
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
lines is legal provided the wager and
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
the method of the wager is legal in the
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
same state where the better is in the
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
state where the actually where the race
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
actually takes place so in the federal
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
stat statute it talks about it being
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
legal in the state that it's taken in
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
order to be legal in the state of New
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have to have a license
 
00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
under RSA 284 so th
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
this in in my humble opinion is
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the bill is to
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
address it is to make it legal and make
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
a license requirement make sure it's
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
clear that you have that you have to get
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
a license to provide the service in the
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and and pay tax
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
follow thank you Mr chairman and as I've
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
contended in many of these
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
hearings the state has owed Revenue
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
rather large Revenue in my estimation
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be pursued so I'm I'm
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
totally against this bill until such a
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
Time the state pursues what the states
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
respect Mr chair if I can again
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
understand the whole point of the bill
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
is to be absolutely clear to give
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
businesses that want to do the work do
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
do this function an ability to do the
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
function I understand that there may be
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
past practice that is is not either is
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
not clear has not been enforced but that
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we shouldn't look
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
forward and whether or not we want to
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
allow our citizens to do this function
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
and whether we want businesses to offer
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
this function in the state of New
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill is a forward-looking
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
bill not a backwards looking Bill I'm
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
looking going forward what we want what
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
we want to do and make absolutely clear
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
so there is no question because
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
apparently there is in somebody's mind
 
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
and it may not be mine may not be yours
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
but there is in somebody's to make it
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely crystal clear that this
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
functions allowed that the uh activity
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
is allowed that we encourage businesses
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
to come into the state to provide this
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
pay the tax and we're going to use that
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
tax to benefit the charities in the
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire follow up follow
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
up okay
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
so by that logic and let's speak logic
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
somebody's been taking these bets for
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
decades continues to take these bets
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
others are not taking these bets right
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
now and is pushing very hard to pay a
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
tax to pay 1.5% out of the revenue
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
gathering for what
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
purpose does that make sense to want to
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
take a a percentage out of your profit
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
line because it's a gray
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
area it doesn't make sense something's
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
not right here and what I believe is not
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
right is the fact that this should be
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
litigated this should be looked into and
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
this should be pursued because it's been
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
an illegal activity for decades under
 
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.710 align:start position:0%
an illegal activity for decades under
RSA

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
284 and the state is owed its end and
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
moreover uh brick and morar places like
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
the old Rockingham Park I'm from Salem
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
lost Revenue the Brooke right now loses
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue the only operator who is legally
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
licensed to take this kind of
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
betting and if if I was you know taking
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
these types of online
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
bets I'd probably not be too concerned
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
with pursuing legislation that's going
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
to take money out of my pocket unless
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
there was an issue with it so I think it
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at further and we
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
need to go forward with it after it gets
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
looked at so again this is not a
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
retrospective law we're not allowed to
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
make retrospective laws by our
 
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
constitution we can't make a bill a law
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
that looks back and forces activity
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
based on prior actions we can only make
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
bills laws based on today going forward
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill seeks to do
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
today going forward whether or not this
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee thinks that advanced deposit
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
wagering betting on on the on the
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Derby uh should be legal in New
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if we on your phone or or
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
through an advanced deposit wagering
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
process um should that be legal that's
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
the question past practice you can take
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
up the Attorney General's office and see
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
if they want to pursue an investigation
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
they want to pursue the Dr or Lottery
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
whether they want to pursue prior taxes
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mitigate or or or uh do
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
away with the reason for this bill which
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
is to make it going forward legal and to
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
allow Revenue again to go to our
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
Charities um to support our citizens
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you for taking my
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
question could you say a little bit more
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
about how the money is going to get to
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
Charities cuz that's different sure so
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
I'll give you the perception the the
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
what what I what I the envisionment is
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's in and in the bill so again the the
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
lottery would find a third party
 
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:10.039 align:start position:0%
administrator take an RFP do an RFP for
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
it I'm thinking someone like the center
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
for nonprofits could take that could put
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
in for the RFP and manage the grant it's
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
basically that's what we're doing is
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
we're chating we're creating a
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
charitable fund grant for at the state
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
level and allow the um that uh
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
administrative agency the administrative
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
third party uh administrator to um issue
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
the grants and then when they issue
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
those grants so again the Northfield
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
Little League says we need new uniforms
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to put a grant in for 7500
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
bucks they would review the grant see
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
whether or not it fits the criteria so
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
again one of the criteria for a charity
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for Grants is that they
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't currently participate in
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming right we're not
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
looking for people to double dip we're
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
looking for reaching out into other
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
areas of our state other Charities
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
within our state and give them an
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the grants that they
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
need so the Little League doesn't
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
participate in charitable gaming and
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
they uh in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
and the and they would issue the Grant
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
and then they would report on an annual
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
basis the center for nonprofits here's
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
what we did with all your money the
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
$200,000 you gave us for a grant here's
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
how we gave those grants
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
out follow up follow up um I you know I
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
think the grant approach uh is
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
interesting um it is a change from some
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
things that have happened in the past my
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
um followup is right now a commission is
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
studying all this and one of the issues
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
is how Charities get money and how it is
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
fair and so on and so forth I'm just
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
wondering should we pass this before the
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
commission has um done a report on what
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
they recommend so while I do serve on
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
that commission um and we are looking at
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
the way charitable gaming operators
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
select their Charities we're not looking
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
at about and I and maybe I don't want to
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
misspeak because we're not at conclusion
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
so it's again I'm I'm doing it based on
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
what my perception of the Revol of it is
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
is that we're not necessarily looking at
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
how we get money to Charities who aren't
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
participating in charitable gaming it's
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
how it's only for oper operators and how
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
operators manage Charities within the
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
gaming operation uh uh gaming facility
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
so this would still reach out beyond
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
that mod okay thank you for clarifying
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.230 align:start position:0%
that uh
representative

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
PL thank you m thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question if we would
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
have passed this bill uh representative
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
set was talking about past history would
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
this would this uh color that past
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
history and and make uh make a case uh
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
for the person The Entity who was
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
violating all those years say well it's
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
legal now and it's one of the half
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
percent so we backcast a one and a half
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
percent instead of some other number so
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
I would I guess and I don't mean to
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
argue but I would make a statement that
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
it would be just the opposite that by
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
passing the bill that gives the Attorney
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
General a clear line say that prior to
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
this it was an illegal activity and you
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
are due the money but again I don't know
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
how you get money from someone who's
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
done illegal activity but um other than
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
bring a criminal charge against them
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to do something like
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
that so again I think that this is not a
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
retrospective law they could easily
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
Lottery could easily talk about you know
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
their your experience of any lensey
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not they've been violating
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
this law or not as a as a um you know as
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
a item under license requirements
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you Mr
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
chair good morning um I have a question
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
about the part that says um hire an
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
administrator to determine how to
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
distribute that money that comes in and
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
the estimate that we have is about
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
200,000 a year that would come in and
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
you described what that administrator
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
would do as receiving requests for grant
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
funding and reviewing that to me um it
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
seem I would I would
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
expect uh that
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
administrative uh person to cost at
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
least $50,000 which would be a year
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
which would be a quarter of the money
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's coming in and wouldn't it make
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
more sense to just let that money go
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund and then
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
you'd have no loss for um that any sort
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
of administration to go with that sure
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so um again
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find it give me one second
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
um there's a cap on the revenue that the
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
third party administrator is allowed to
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
take and if I remember right it's 10%
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to find it
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you page four um so there's a
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
cap so again the idea being that the
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
person who's doing this is already doing
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
grants and that this would just give
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
them a little more work and and have
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
that person that's already issuing so
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
the center for nonprofits is does do
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
things like check Grant distribution
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
from other Revenue sources and so again
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
I would say that there this would just
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
give them a little more Revenue to help
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
the alleviate the new administrative
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
overhead um but it's capped at 10% so
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
$21,000 based on the fiscal note would
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
be their maximum they're allowed to
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
request they could request less based on
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
how they administer and how efficient
 
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.269 align:start position:0%
how they administer and how efficient
they

00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
are and to answer your last question so
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
the questions always keeps coming going
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
up in his committee is can we divert
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
gaming money to things other than
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
education right and so the answer is is
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
yes and I think you're going to get a
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
letter I I spoke about this prior from
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
the if you haven't gotten already from
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office um that
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
says that if if you remember in 1990 we
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
merged lottery in and we used to have
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
our own gaming commission and the money
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
was unrestricted we could do what we
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
want the legislature could do we want
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
Lottery money which is scratch tickets
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
and and and meab bucks and Mega Millions
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
and all of those games of of of Lottery
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
that Lottery is restricted so um it's
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
clear that we can divert this money
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
again and keeping in mind just like we
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
do at charitable gaming right the whole
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
point of the charitable gaming is the
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
Charities right uh people would say in
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and so um I'm trying to
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
keep with that intent of what games of
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
chance and charitable gaming were for
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's for Charities and to keep the money
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
in that realm representative spillsbury
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Senator Lang I'm GNA
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
ask you a question of interpretation so
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
sure on on page three this provides uh
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
line 30 and
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
31 that uh charitable grants from
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
eligible contributions to charitable
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
organizations can go to those who are
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
not participating in charitable
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
gaming and then on page
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
four the last in the list of uh what the
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
charitable third party Financial
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
intermediary will be doing says in j
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
line 14 and 15 limit and condition
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
charitable grants so that they are
 
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
dispersed equitably throughout the state
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
now there's a vast Universe of Charities
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
that are under the first of those two
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions I cited not currently in
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
involved in charitable gaming how do you
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
envision that this
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
Authority uh in Little
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
J uh would be
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
interpreted so first equitably
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
throughout the state what does that
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that so the intention was
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if we happen to hire
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
an or an administrative organization
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
that was from conquered that the only
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
people that ever got charitable grants
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
was from conquered um we wanted to make
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
sure that it was geographically
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
dispersed or dispersed throughout the
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
state so that line is is to give them
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
Direction and say that you need to look
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
Beyond just your own town that you're in
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
um we look at um so again we talk about
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
weight lists that are on there so a char
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
could choose not to do the weight list
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
and just apply for a grant and get off
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
the weit list the charity could because
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
they're not participating in charitable
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
gaming they they don't get dates because
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
they're on the waight list um so they
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
could choose to do that again the goal
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that uh a charity from
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh New Hampshire has just as
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
much uh chance of getting uh a a a grant
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
from this organization as a charity from
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
Nashua so I just would point out that's
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
interesting I appreciate your
 
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:28.350 align:start position:0%
interesting I appreciate your
interpretation

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
and I see when it says
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
dispersed throughout the state you have
 
00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
dispersed throughout the state you have
a

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
geographic uh Point here that eluded me
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
it uh representative
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question I'm a
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
little bit confused here I often find
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
myself this way uh when you look at the
 
00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.350 align:start position:0%
myself this way uh when you look at the
fiscal

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
pages uh it points out that the lottery
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
fund education trust fund Lottery
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
revenues credit blah blah and it talks
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
about the revenue
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
projections from this it looks like the
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
revenue would be going to the education
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund instead it's being directed
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
and the the revenue here looks to me
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be a net gain for the
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
fund because the note talks about the
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
education trust fund either I don't have
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
the same note as you it's a chart it's a
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
chart oh you have you have the as
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
introduced version so there's a new
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
version ah sorry that's that's if you
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
look at the amended version and fiscal
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
note is different all right well then
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
let me follow up Mr chair follow up
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um why are we not
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
giving the funds to the education trust
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
fund instead of to Charities sure thank
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question so again the idea
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
being is keeping in line that gaming in
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's purpose has been we
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
we've made a legislative decision to
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
have gaming money revenues go to
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
Charities um with with with in games of
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
chance and this kind of horse racing um
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
unlike Lottery which we've made a
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
distinct constitutional provision to say
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
it must go to education so don't get me
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
wrong the legislature could choose to
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
send it to the education chest fund my
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
point is that this is in Theory new
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue um in keeping with new Revenue
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
in line with our past practices of
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
having charitable gaming be focused on
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
Charities uh it's been a a significant
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
Topic in this in this committee room as
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
well as mine on the other side of the
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
wall um that making sure the money stays
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
within Charities for that Lottery money
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
stay within in
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
yeah uh anybody else yes representative
 
00:30:55.559 --> 00:31:03.190 align:start position:0%
yeah uh anybody else yes representative
Ames

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh first question is uh in response to a
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
question from representative Southworth
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
you um said that you thought that the
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
commission that's looking at uh the new
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
gaming laws that relate to charal gaming
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
um uh would um not be addressing the
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
subject that's in this bill
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
and as you know I too sit on that and I
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
you did qualify what you said saying
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that the commission
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
has yet reached but uh I would say that
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
I would think as one other member of
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
this commission that uh it's very likely
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
that there would be interest in this in
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
effect it's filling out the picture of
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
charal gaming um looking at uh
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
charitable entities that are not um
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason maybe they just
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a slot but participating in
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and uh and providing
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
something for them so I maybe you could
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
respond a little further about why you
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
think this would be outside the perview
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
or interest of uh the commission well so
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
my it's it's not part of the five
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
charges that that commission has and
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
while we've expanded that and fairly
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
significantly uh in that commission what
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um again
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
we were looking at charitable gaming in
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
terms of games of chance uh HHR and
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
those things this is a new activity um
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that is not that doesn't currently
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
exist um as far as the advanced deposit
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
wagering piece so um so again I don't
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
know I'm trying to remember if we even
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
talked about it in the commission um but
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
again I think that again this bill
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
fulfills the mission of keeping gaming
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
and revenues from gaming and the
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
charitable and in charitable Market um
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
and they may be interested it and may
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
like the fact that in fact we are
 
00:33:07.629 --> 00:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
reaching out beyond the uh the um
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
Charities that can only get slots that
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking for other
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities to be able to uh use
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming Monies to uh support
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow it's really a further
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
question okay um and it um
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's really about the order of magnitude
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
of the money that's going to
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
be potentially funneled into
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
new intermediary that would then send
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
the money out to Charities
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
the what the picture I have in my mind
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
is that we're talking about to start
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
with any the only numbers we have here
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
are perhaps 200,000 or a little less
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
than that when you get through the
 
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
10% um and uh and then you
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
got I don't have no idea how many
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
Charities are out there but there are a
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
lot of Charities and you've got this uh
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
one criteria of dispersal um Geographic
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
that uh uh was mentioned in
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
another question um but how in the world
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to pick between all these
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
Charities other than giving a give a
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollar to each one of them or something
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
like that I mean uh uh you're giving a
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
lot of authority without any direction
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
legislature to a private inter
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
intermediary um who's going to somehow
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
either uh go through a lottery system or
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
do something maybe more selective that's
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
totally selective and give all the money
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
to something that sounds good but what
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
how do you respond to that
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question so again um
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
you got to start somewhere right so my
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
goal is again this is a 200 th roughly
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
after expenses a $200,000 grant that the
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
states issuing we regularly go through
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
processes for issuing grants we don't
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
give we don't equally disperse the money
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
when we issue grants in the state of New
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's from the water
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
fund or whether it's from anything else
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
right people base their decisions on the
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
merits of of what the grant request is
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
and what I'd say is that the to use my
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
example the Little League of the the
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
little league in Northfield that asked
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
for $7500 it's told they only going to
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
get $5,000 I promise you they're still
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to be happy right they're still
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
going to very much appreciate the fact
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
that they got some assistance from the
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
organization okay um thank you

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um uh in New Hampshire I
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
guess I would uh direct your attention
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
to the uh last page of the bill as
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate and the fiscal
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
note and really just the first two lines
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note this bill seeks to
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
license and regulate Advanced deposit
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
wagering on horse racing and then in
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
parenthesis Advanced deposit wagering
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
currently takes place in New Hampshire
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
and is not subject to
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
regulation the interstate horse racing
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
Act of 1978 authorized electronic
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
betting on horse
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
races States could choose
 
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
races States could choose
to

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh license and tax those activities they
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
could choose to ban those activities
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
effectively or they could do nothing at
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
all um and in number of states a dozen
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
or so at least including New Hampshire
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
did nothing at all and so a number of
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
companies including Churchill Downs had
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
operated Advanced deposit wagering uh in
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
the states that uh did not do it because
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
was authorized by federal law and I
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that's the the key sticking point
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
with those who think there was something
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
illegal going on is that um a number of
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
companies ours included operating under
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
the assumption that it's allowed by
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
federal law unless the state does
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
something more restrictive so that's
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
kind of where we're at uh back in 2021
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
late 2021 early 2022 Churchill Downs uh
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in purchasing the
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
Chasers Poker Room in Salem and in its
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Lottery Commission
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General um they
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
expressed their concern about this
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
so-called gray area um and obviously as
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
we all know I think the Lottery
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
Commission is pretty strict with respect
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
to its licensing of operators for
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in New Hampshire and
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
it was clear to Churchill that being
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
involved with Advanced deposit wagering
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh would be in a gray area
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh may not uh uh look good uh in terms
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
of being a operator of charal gaming in
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we voluntarily stopped
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
doing the advanced deposit wagering and
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
pledged to work with the Lottery
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
Commission to put together some kind of
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh to support a bill that would
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
establish once and for all clearly in
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
state law whether it's legal or not I
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
guess I would say to you uh you should
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
make a decision is it illegal or is it
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
legal and and pass a law to clarify that
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
I will say that if you pass pass a bill
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
like this that um authorizes it it's
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
effective I think the effective date on
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
this is July 1st of this year it only
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
applies this illegality only applies to
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
anything that happens after July 1st if
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
for some reason the Attorney General
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
determines that something illegal was
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
happening which we very much doubt uh
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
nothing prevents the Attorney General
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
from going back uh prior to July 1st
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
2024 um and taking action on that so I
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
think the Crux of the matter is um the
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
the because New Hampshire hadn't taken
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
any steps regarding Advanced deposit
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
wagering we were operating under the
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
federal law and I think that's how we
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
end up where we are now um right now we
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
basically have a an unlevel playing
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
field we have companies that have uh
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
been operating so back in 2022 almost
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
two years ago Churchill voluntarily
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
stopped Advanced deposit wagering in New
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh other companies have
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
continue to do it for two years uh I
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
I would I would suggest that if the
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
Attorney General thought that this was
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
an illegal activity that they would have
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
issued a cease and desist order to those
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
that have continued to do it so
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
basically what's happening is our
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
competitors get to do it but we don't uh
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
and all we're asking is make it clear in
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
law uh and everybody's got a Level
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
Playing Field uh consumer protections
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
are involved and it would be better for
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
everybody and uh then finally I know
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's been some questions about the uh
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
the additions in the Senate regarding
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
the chable third party Financial
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
intermediary and whether it should go to
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
this charitable group to do something or
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
whether it should go to the education
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund if this committee decides
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
that they want to just go back to the
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund would be happy to
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
work it's a relatively simple change to
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
the bill to to make that happen so happy
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee on that if
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's your pleasure so I think that's
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the main points I want to make is
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh we do not feel this is an illegal
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
activity uh we do feel that the
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
interstate the federal law governed this
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire took no action now
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
some states took action and they
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
effectively made it difficult or
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
impossible to do Advanced deposit
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
wagering uh and so we don't operate in
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
those States in those states that do
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
license it then we operate in those
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
States uh as per their licensing and all
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
the other states like New Hampshire uh
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
we operate where the bets basically are
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
being accepted at a site in Oregon uh
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
which all the operators use and that's
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
kind of a Consolidated area for all the
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
activity so with that said I'd be happy
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you
 
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.870 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you
representative

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
ducet thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
for take my question I'm curious as to
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh if you can give me a date when twin
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
Spire started taking bets in New
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh thank you for the question
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative I don't know that
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
although based on the discussions at the
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
hearing for Senate Bill 190 last year uh
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
you had suggested that was 2002 and um I
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
don't know any better than that I assume
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
you were informed on that so I'll I'll
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
go with that if that's what you think it
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
is I don't know follow up and you
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
stopped taking bets in
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
2021 probably
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
2022 22 okay
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
and what I'm hearing you testify to is
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
you believe this is legal but you stop
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
taking the bets because it's a gray
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
area uh the regulator of terrible gaming
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire felt it was a gray area
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
and uh if your regulator feels it a gray
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
area then probably pay attention to what
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
they say okay thank you
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
shamber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
ducet brought this up earlier I believe
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill as presented becomes law
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire how many other states
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable in uh that would
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
accept these
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
Wagers um I don't know the exact
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
breakdown of states that specifically
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
authorize it states that say nothing and
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
states that prohibit it uh there's a
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
handful of states that I know prohibit
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
it um my recollection is there were a
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
dozen or so States maybe somewhere
 
00:43:35.309 --> 00:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
between 12 and 20 probably that the law
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
is silent on it uh this law would only
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
apply to New
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Aly thank you
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
that leads into my question on I was
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
hearing that the federal law says that
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
you can only do this within the state
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
that um the racing is carried out in uh
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
but we've got other programs doing doing
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
this still in New Hampshire and nobody
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
how many of them are there can you tell
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
us who they are they aren't here are
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
they they're in Las Vegas and places
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
like that so I don't know exactly I know
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
there's three primary companies involved
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
in advanced deposit wagering one is
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs not in New Hampshire
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
currently uh another is Express bets who
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
I believe has a lobbyist present here I
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
believe they're from Rhode Island uh and
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
a third one is called TVG I believe and
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where they're located at
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
least one of those other ones is also a
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
publicly traded
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
company so they're still doing it in New
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire though the federal law
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
apparently just doesn't allow them to do
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire well no I would say
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
that they are accepting bets from New
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents uh and they believe
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
that under the federal law they're
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that and they are not
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
seeking to be licensed in New Hampshire
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
to operate charitable gaming so they you
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
know probably have less concern as to
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
what Lottery and attorney general may
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
think about the gray
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
area representative
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
ol um thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just trying to
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
understand the the logic of your
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
argument that this is a gray area or
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the argument is the
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
federal government can tell the states
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
what to
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
state that seems to be the
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
argument New Hampshire doesn't have a
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
law regarding this but it does have
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
a anybody know how to take these new
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
things and put them on mute anybody
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
don't do not
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
disturb oh yeah thank you um so besides
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's just someone trying to sell me
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.230 align:start position:0%
it's just someone trying to sell me
Medicare

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
that an interstate law interstate
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
commerce which requires action in the
 
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.470 align:start position:0%
commerce which requires action in the
state

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
for it to be legal under interstate
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
commerce but when there is no law in the
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
state it's not illegal because there is
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
no law but it's illegal in the state
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
because there is no
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
law I you see where I'm not really no
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
well neither do I so I I really don't
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
understand the argument
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
there uh don't understand my argument
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that it's legal yeah yeah I mean
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
our view is the um interstate commerce
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh Interstate horse racing act uh
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
allowed for electronic betting on horse
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
races and allowed states to uh regulate
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh Andor tax it and those states that
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
chose not to I see what you're saying
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
now uh those states that chose not to um
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
then uh it's something that's allowed by
 
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.990 align:start position:0%
then uh it's something that's allowed by
federal

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
just a couple of questions uh the first
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
is on the
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
charitable part of this thing the the
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
new part um and you said you really
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a position on that one way or
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
the other um correct and I understand
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
that um I'm I'm wondering you you must
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
have participated in the Senate side
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the public side of this uh bill and
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
whether you uh whether you observed that
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
there were comments or information
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
provided about this part of the bill was
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
that testified too and can you share
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that with us uh my recollection and it's
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's just that so there's a disclaimer
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
there my recollection that this
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
amendment regarding the charitable
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
charity issue uh was an amendment
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
brought forth at the executive session
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe it was part of the
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh and and I assume we
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
testified on the original bill um but
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
maybe not but I'm pretty sure the
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that made this the big change
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
was uh came in at executive session that
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
in accord with my impression um and then
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh if I may the other question is on the
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude of uh revenues and um
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
you we have in in this uh as amended
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
version uh a number
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
22,500 as I I guess the amount that's uh
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
transferred um either to intermediaries
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
or we went back to the other route would
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
go to the education trust fund um and it
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
might be a slightly different number if
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
we did a different rate uh but whatever
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
um my question is whether you think
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's in the right range the
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
212,000 uh thank you for the question my
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is it probably is um I
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
know starting in 2019 2020 the Lottery
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
Commission was uh surveying the various
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
providers of advanced deposit wagering
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh initially in 2021 or so
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
they they tried to do some rule making
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
realized they didn't have the authority
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
to do the rulemaking but in advance of
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
that was collecting information from the
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
providers of advanced deposit wagering
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh and so Lottery I'm pretty sure has
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
access to
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh what the total wager uh is for New
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents um I've been told
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
also compared it to some similar States
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
uh to see if was in the range so I think
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's based on a total wages of wagering
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
of $17 million and this would be 1.25%
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
of whatever that was yes I think it's
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
pretty close probably thank you okay
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um oh one uh representative
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
duet okay thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you you State
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
of the State didn't do anything relative
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
to Advanced deposit wagering it's just
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention and it's
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
actually written in this bill on page
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
three line 25 through 2 uh 25 and 26
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
talks about parool rule
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
525 which
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
specifically uh which is uh was enacted
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
by the racing commission here in New
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to allow for advanced deposit
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
wagering and in order to do so you
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
284 it seems yet again we have state
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
statute state
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
law that
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
dictates how
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
ADW happens in New Hampshire and the
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
gray area is getting darker is is my
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
comment on this uh thank you for the
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm I'm aware of exactly
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
what that refers to um and I can
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
certainly look at that and I would say
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
again that uh regardless uh passing this
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh takes effect July 1st uh it does
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
not in any way uh erase whatever
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
happened prior to that and if the
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General determines that there
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
is some illegality there they have the
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
ability to pursue that this does not
 
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.309 align:start position:0%
ability to pursue that this does not
erase

00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
erase
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you for your testimony
 
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.109 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you for your testimony
thank

00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for this opportunity
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
to testify today on Senate Bill
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
432 uh I work with deur and prol here in
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
conquer and here today representing
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
express bet uh an ADW
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
provider and so what I want to do today
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
I think you are all pretty familiar with
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
the concept again this is sort of the
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
second goal round you saw this if very
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
very similar Bill last year um I again
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
like Mr bragon want to highlight that
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
first sentence of the fiscal note
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
because I think very simply this is what
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about um and it says
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to license and regulate
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced deposit wagering on horse
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
raising Advanced deposit wagering
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
currently takes place in New Hampshire
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
is not subject to regulation so at the I
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
mean that's really what this is all
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
about it already takes place we operate
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
cury in the State uh you heard from
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs obviously they they they
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
ceased operating we continue to operate
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh we disagree obviously that this is
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
illegal activity uh what I will say is
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
and I want to clarify about ADW we're
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about live horse
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
racing um and that's it nothing else
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
this doesn't go beyond that um it falls
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
into its own separate category so last
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
year you had a bill that would addressed
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
online gambling generally think you know
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
poker that's different uh this is
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
different than sports betting it's not
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming it's not HHR um so
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
this really is its own entirely separate
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
category and it's the only form of
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
gambling that currently takes place in
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that isn't regulated and
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's really the purpose behind this
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill it licenses and regulates the
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
industry uh and with regulation
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
obviously comes the the revenue uh
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
whether to the state or in this case to
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
Charities so I you know very simply at
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the day what this bill is all
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
about you have a you have gambling that
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
currently takes place in New Hampshire
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
that will likely continue regardless of
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of how you decide to vote on
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the question then with
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
respect to Senate Bill 432 is regulation
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
and revenue or status quo which is
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
neither so that's I mean that's really
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
the question before you today uh and
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
then just I want to address some of the
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
sort of the legal aspects or at least
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of the arguments that we've heard
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
today so in representative UL you had
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
asked about the federal law so what I'll
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
say about the federal law is that so the
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
federal law permits um this activity but
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't preempt the states so the
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
states then can restrict it further and
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
many states have chosen to do so they
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
can either regulate and license the
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
activity which many states do uh they
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
can prohibit the activity or that third
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
sort of category of states which is
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire currently Falls uh
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
is they just remain silent and don't
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
address it at all and that's sort of the
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
gray area that you've heard about today
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
but those sort of how the states address
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
this issue falling into one of those
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
three buckets that's really
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
wellestablished and I'm not aware of any
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
examples um where courts have decided
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
that states that are silent with respect
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
to this issue or that this activity is
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
illegal in states that have chosen to
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
remain silent with respect to this issue
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh also in New Hampshire
 
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.710 align:start position:0%
uh also in New Hampshire
uh

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
specifically the legality here was
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
investigated by the AG's office back in
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
2022 the result of that investigation
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
was this legislation um so you have this
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
legislation was really based on the AG's
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
office's recommendation it was drafted
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
and is supported by lottery I think
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's all very important um I will also
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
say you know when we were discussing
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
this bill last year I had had
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with Lottery and asked
 
00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:56.039 align:start position:0%
them is this something we can just deal
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
with in rules and the answer to that
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
question was no because they believe
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
they without this bill they have no
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate ADW so again the
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
fact that they have no current authority
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
to regulate ADW I think speaks to the
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
legality of ADW in the
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
state um and
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
then I I think the argument the idea
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
that express bet or the other providers
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
May owe taxes going back number of years
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
and yes we've operated for a number of
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
years um anticipating I'm sure
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative duett's question I don't
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
know exactly when Express bets started
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
operating but I can tell you we formed
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
in 2002 and if it wasn't 2002 it was
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
probably shortly thereafter so yes it's
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
been many of
 
00:56:39.839 --> 00:56:42.430 align:start position:0%
been many of
years

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
um but this so what's so the only tax
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
rate that currently exists in the state
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
is the tax rate with respect to simoc
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
cast you know so that's that's what is
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
going on currently at the brook
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
they do simal cast that's an off off
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
trck betting facility um that's the one
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
location that currently offers simoc
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
cast and I want to go back then
 
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
to which this the line that
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
representative du said already called
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
out on page three lines 25 and
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
26 so this this exception which was
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
added this year is an exception
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
specifically for the simoc cast
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
providers in this state so the brook the
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
other um facility that could if they
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to offer simulcast but don't
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
currently is Belmont um this exempts
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
them from these licensing Provisions it
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
says you're already licensed for simoc
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
cast purposes we're going to spare you
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
this additional process but the fact
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that that exists and it calls that out
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
and exempts them uh is all the more
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
reason why simal cast and ADW are two
 
00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.630 align:start position:0%
reason why simal cast and ADW are two
separate

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
things and then you know I so with that
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
all being
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
said really I don't think any no there's
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
no legal basis again this was already
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
investigated by the AG's office and then
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
on top of that I would add and this is
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
hypothetically right again we don't
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
think there's really any legal basis or
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is illegal
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if there were a case if
 
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
the AG's office decided we did want to
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
bring a case I want to turn your
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
attention back to the fiscal note this
 
00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:22.829 align:start position:0%
attention back to the fiscal note this
is

00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
$212 is the estimate per year and that's
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
across multiple providers so let's say
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was a case and and the AG's office
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
sought it even 10 years back we're
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
talking about $2 million again that's
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
across multiple providers that's an
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
expensive case to try uh and they likely
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recoup the cost of that case so
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
another reason why it's unlikely that a
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
case will be pursued in New
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and on top of that I guess
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
what I'll say is if this bill were to
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
pass that doesn't preclude the AG's
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
office from still filing a lawsuit
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
so if the concern is revenue loss
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue then you would want to pass this
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
bill immediately because then the
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
revenue starts coming in coming in
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
immediately and I think the the fact
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
that the legislature now has seen this
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
bill last year and this year if it
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
weren't to pass again I think that makes
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
a potential case even more difficult
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
because the legislature has seen it
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
twice they knew about it and chose to do
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
nothing so I think that potentially
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
hurts the case as well
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
um so I guess in summary I mean if you
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
think the industry should be regulated
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
if you think the state is missing out on
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue then this bill makes all the
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
sense in the world and and we request
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
your support the alternative obviously
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
is the status quo which is no regulation
 
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
and no
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue happy to take any
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
ducet thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um Mr Thomas you
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
just testified that you spoke to Lottery
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
and they told you they have no authority
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
to regulate ADW can you tell me who told
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
you that at Lottery uh I had had a
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with um I believe it was
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
you and so I again to your
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
point I think the concern here is that
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
there's an there's an issue with
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
legality there's nothing that we're
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
aware of we're not aware of anything
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
issue because we've never heard from
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
anybody whether at lottery or the AG's
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
office that we should cease operating
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
obviously Churchill ceased operating I
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
think you heard from them today that
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
really it sounds like was a business
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
decision based on their charitable
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
gaming facility here in New Hampshire we
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
obviously don't have a charitable gaming
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
facility and we're not of any we're not
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
aware of any issue with legality outside
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the conversations within this
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee this is a bill that wasn't
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
opposed in the Senate and I don't think
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
you'll hear any testimony and opposition
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
today either
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so express bet is
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
taking who you represent is taking bets
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
at present
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
correct and if this legislation was to
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
pass express bet would be paying 1.5% on
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
the bets taken 1.25% I'm sorry
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
1.25% on the bets taken why is it
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
express bet is here pushing this
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to take Revenue out of their
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
their own Pockets yeah because if it's
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
legal it's legal you're taking bets now
 
01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
right why you sitting in front of us
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's a good question so I
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
say two things one um there's obviously
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
a consumer protection aspect here which
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
I think you know there are Bad actors in
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
the space so with respect to Consumer
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
Protection this is a good thing two it
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
just makes sense for us we are already
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
licensed um we operate in 38 States um
 
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.910 align:start position:0%
licensed um we operate in 38 States um
that

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
includes probably I think there's about
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
28 where we actively where we have an
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
actual licens and are regulated there's
 
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
about 10 um which are similar to New
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are silent on the law we
 
01:02:04.029 --> 01:02:04.039 align:start position:0%
still operate and obviously we're licens
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
and regulated in other states and follow
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
those rules um and just I would say take
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
pride in sort of being a safe and secure
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
platform uh the fact and and being
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
licensed and regulated wherever possible
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so this was a bill again uh you
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
heard about the investigation back in
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
2022 this bill was the result of that
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
investigation uh and we're just we think
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to sort of work with
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
the state and work with Lottery than
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
than than fight this issue because we
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
are licensed and regulated in other
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
states representative
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um I'm trying to figure
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
out the
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
relationship what um the rule making
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
section does on you say
 
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
section does on you say
that

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
you're do you have any physical do they
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
have any Express bets in TV BG or
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the name of that is and do they
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a physical presence in New
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I'm not aware of any
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
physical presence so they're just on
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
taking bets across the internet correct
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
correct yeah and um but it looks like
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
you said that church showns did buy that
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
poker room in Salem so they have a
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
physical presence um under Ru making it
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
includes cludes it it is amending in the
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
ru making section not here but it says
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the sale of paramutual pool pools is
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
authorized under
 
01:03:38.359 --> 01:03:40.789 align:start position:0%
authorized under
284

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
284
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
2222a 22b and
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
22d which is the new Advanced deposit
 
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.510 align:start position:0%
22d which is the new Advanced deposit
but

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.150 align:start position:0%
but
22b

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
22b
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
um is the charitable game naming horse
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing which is a slot
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
machine right or as near to it as you
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
get there the owners are calling them
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
slot machines now um
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
and does
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
that relate to what is going on in this
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill namely will the um will all of your
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
three be
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
taking that
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
um I guess it would be particularly be
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs be taking bets uh on on
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
historic horse in historic horse racing
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
machines and producing a and having
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
accounts that people could put money
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
into and then play those machines until
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
they run out of
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
money um is that part of this de no AB
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely not so ADW is well ADW for
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
one is sort of is separate and walled
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
off from all other types of gambling so
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
this that particular
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
provision grants rulle making authority
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
to Lottery it just adds now ADW it has
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
no impact with respect to what already
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
exists for HHR and as you know HHR is
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
limited um to certain a certain number
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
of facilities currently physical
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
locations and express bet doesn't have a
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
physical location uh um you know that
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
Churchill Downs has a physical location
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
but what they do at that physical
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
location is entirely separate from ADW
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
um so ADW operates sort of in its own in
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
its own lane where in the law does that
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
happen where does what happen I'm sorry
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
sorry follow on that ADW is totally
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
separate from everything except um well
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
you're using it for live horse racing
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
only but right I mean that's well that's
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
laid out here in this particular bill um
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
it's with ADW is specifically with
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
paramutual um wagering on live horse
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
racing according to the interstate horse
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
racing act and that's it that's all this
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
covers that's the very first line top of
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
it's but where um okay where what do you
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
are the interstate horsing in compliance
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
section and the interstate horse racing
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
because when they put historic horse
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
racing into the law they put it in the
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
racing section and I have a great deal
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
of difficulty differentiating what
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
applies across
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the two of them they are very
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
different things I guess again what I
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
would say to that is currently ADW is
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
not addressed in state
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
law this would add a section specific to
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
ADW all other forms of gambling um that
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
currently take place in the state
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
already exist in law there are sections
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
specific obviously the charal game into
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
HHR and all those things this is
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
entirely separate and would exist
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
okay um yes represent fellows thank you
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
I have two questions uh one of them is
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
short answer um the age for
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
participation in this bill is 18 and I'm
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you might know the
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
other states that you deal with if the
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
age is 18 or if it's something else and
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
my other question is the entity that
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
owns your business um Express
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
bets do they have um subdivisions that
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
are involved with any other kinds of
 
01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:09.799 align:start position:0%
wagering or gambling yes so first
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
question age that I don't know the
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
answer to I assume it's I assume it's 18
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
I think um the way this bill was drafted
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
was using sort of other state sources as
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
a sort of as a foundation or a template
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
um so I assume in other states it's most
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
likely the age is 18 that may be a
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
product of federal law as well I don't
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
question remind me again I'm sorry it
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
has to do with the business structure
 
01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
that oh yes I'm comp you're in yeah so
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
Express beted is a subsidiary of a
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
larger company that larger company has
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
other companies involved in other in
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
activity okay um thank you very much for
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
your test oh did I miss one ah
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative shamber your dad's not
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
he Mr chairman thank you I don't think
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
your daughter heard that I it's all
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
right I'm not color blindest oh okay
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
because we do have red lights in this
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
state sir okay uh regarding uh
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives do said about uh
 
01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:23.470 align:start position:0%
Representatives do said about uh
business

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
models uh does Express bets believe in
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire charitable gaming
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
approach as part of their business
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
model meaning meaning money going to
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
Charities money going to benefit other
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and people in the state I
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
mean I I think that's a great thing we
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
obviously support the bill as it exists
 
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
today with money going to the Charities
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
I will tell you in other states uh
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
passing similar licensing and in
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
regulation um there has been a similar
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
move I'm familiar with at least one
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
state I remember exactly where it is but
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
also in that case when they license and
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
regulated ADW they send that money to
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
charity as well so it's not um it's not
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
a novel concept obviously not in this
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
state either so we do support it uh but
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent and there's been many
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions obviously about the charitable
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
piece of this uh to the
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
extent that's sort of a a sticking point
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
or it causes
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
confusion we're most concerned obviously
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
peace okay thank you very much for your
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
you and uh I've got one more pink card
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
it is Michael Haley from the Department
 
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
it is Michael Haley from the Department
of

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
Justice good morning Mr chair and
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members my name is
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
Michael Haley I serve as the Director of
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts at the Department of
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
Justice I'm here just to speak about the
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
charitable aspect of this
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
bill um I don't have any uh any
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the the lottery aspect
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill um our office the
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit is charged with
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
protecting the Public's interest in
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and assets dedicated to
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes in New Hampshire um
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
and there are currently approximately
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
5,600 uh New Hampshire based Charities I
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
realize that was a question earlier on
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
um we don't take any position on the
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill I'm just here to provide some
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
information U particularly about some of
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
the wording relating to the charitable
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
component of this bill that uh could be
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
read as inconsistent with other laws and
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
if the committee was planning on U
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a bill might want to
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
look into those um I essenti I have
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much Four Points to mention
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
they're all on page four of the bill um
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
so I'll go through those and I'm happy
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
to take any questions about any of
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
those um the first point is on page four
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
um lines three and five um this this
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
section of the bill refers to the the
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
charitable intermediary organization and
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
requires that it not have an owner or
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
operator who also owns or operates a
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
charitable organization participating in
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
charitable grant program um the concern
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
here is that Charities don't have owners
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
um by definition the assets of a charity
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
belong to the public because the public
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate beneficiary so I I
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
suspect that the intent here was to
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
prevent a director or officer of a chair
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
it someone who perhaps on the board an
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
executive director a Chief Financial
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
Officer someone like that associated
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
with the charity from uh holding one of
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
these positions if that's the case I
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
would suggest that um that uh words such
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
as um uh director officer or trustee
 
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
would be more in line with how uh
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
charitable assets are are
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
held um the second point that I would
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
like to raise is on line 12 of page 4 um
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
and it refers to there being no carry
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
forward of unused eligible contributions
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the first program year I'd just be
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
curious what the plan would be for any
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh assets that were not used um I'd want
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
to bring to the committee's attention a
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court case that uh originated
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the trustees of
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College versus Woodward it's
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
an 1819 case so quite old but still a
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
good law that places some restrictions
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
on what uh the government can do with
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
funds that have gone to a charity um and
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
so in this case uh I don't know what the
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
plan would be if there was money left
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
over if that was going to be taken back
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
by the state you would want to be
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
careful about uh that particular Supreme
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
Court case I'll just interrupt you for a
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
second represent that wasn't line
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
12 just gonna say I think we must be
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
looking at different versions maybe I I
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
apologize do I have an old version of
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
the bill I I have a a line that says
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
there shall be no carry forward of
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
unused eligible contributions am I in
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
the wrong that's line okay uh I'll I'll
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
stop referring to lines because I
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
imagine I have the wrong version then um
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
is there a a line in the current bill
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
that talks about maintaining separate
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
accounts for charitable funds and
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
operating funds 11 that's 11 okay uh so
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
on on line 11 then um the uh all funds
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
of a 501c3 are charitable funds by
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
definition so uh I'm not entirely sure
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
what the intent of this this line was um
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
and uh perhaps uh if the intention was
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
to delineate the grant funds versus the
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
operating expenses that uh Grant funds
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
would be a more accurate description
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
here of of what's Happening um and then
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming the next line below that
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
not award a charitable Grant to any
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
lineal descendant or equivalent step
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
person of any officer director or
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
employee of any charitable third party
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
Financial intermediary um here you would
 
01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
want to be careful about uh any language
 
01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
suggesting that a charitable Grant could
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
go to an individual I believe that the
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
intent here is that the charitable uh
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
the intermediary we' be making grants to
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
other Charities um and a charity must be
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
designed to uh to benefit the public and
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
not to benefit private individuals so uh
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
again if the intent here was to limit uh
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
prevent the charitable grants from going
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
to any organization that had as a
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
director officer or trustee a lineal
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
descendant um then the committee may
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
want to consider language that made that
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
that clear um and uh just and as a
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
general comment from reading this over
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
with a limited background and limited
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
time um I didn't see a definition of
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
advanced deposit wagering in it which
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
would have aided me in in trying to
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
review uh what this bill was trying to
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
do that's not really pertaining to the
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
charitable section and and it may be
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in law I only got this
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon so I apologize if
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
that is defined
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere um could you um give or email
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
a version of your proposal certainly
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
changes thank you is that you
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
want yes uh this is the clerk speaking
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
you went 78 RPM I can only type at 33
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
RPM so if you could provide that
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
material that
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
would okay yes represent Aly would it be
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
worth asking him if he could redraft
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
those sections for us to take a look
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
at instead of just commenting on what we
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
need to change but change it to
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
what I I could certain I I would have to
 
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
get uh approval from our office about
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
providing specific Bill language but I
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
could certainly look into that okay
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spillsbury
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um I thought those uh comments
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
seem to be well taken except I'm a
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
little confused on the first of your
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
four comments so on line one in page
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
four the words not have an owner or
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
operator dot dot dot that doesn't relate
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
to the charity that's receiving the
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
grant right it relates to a char a a
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
third party Financial intermediary the
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
one who's going to make the allocation
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
decisions so I'm not sure why I'm not
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
sure what your objection is uh the thank
 
01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
you for the question the concern is that
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
that charitable intermediary also can't
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
have an owner there's no such thing as
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
the owner of a charity and the the
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
intermediary is required to be a 501c3
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
organization are you suggesting that the
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
charitable intermediary M must itself be
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
a charity I believe that's what the bill
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
says at least the one that I have it's
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the definition it says that an
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
intermediary has to be recognized under
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
501c3 of the Internal Revenue
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
code um thank you for drawing me to that
 
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
code um thank you for drawing me to that
thank

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
ellerie oh thank you that brings up The
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
Perennial question since New Hampshire
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
recognizes a lot of things that are
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
Charities that aren't Charities that are
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
Charities um
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
so under the scheme that you're
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
describing the dispersing agency would
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to be a
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
501c3 now 501 c3s are then restricted to
 
01:18:10.629 --> 01:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
c3s so uh thank you for the question 501
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
c3s are restricted to carrying out their
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
their um charitable
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
purposes um there are charitable
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that make distributions um
 
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
to entities that are not recognized as
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
501 c3s for example um there are trusts
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of which is to make
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
distributions to a particular church and
 
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
the churches typically are not
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
recognized under 501c3 as tax exempt
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
even though they are they are tax exempt
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
entities they're they do not have 501c3
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
status so uh it could I I'm not an
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
expert on federal tax law I could see
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
there potentially being concerns about
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
distributions made to the 501 C4s the
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
sixes the 10s the 19s that um that New
 
01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in some circumstances also
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
calls Charities that would have to be
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
something that the um the third party
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
intermediary would want to uh be careful
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
about I suppose um when seeking their
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
501c3 tax exemption and Reporting their
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
distributions to the
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
IRS followup
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
follow well there's a lot more than that
 
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
involved um although you did hit on the
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
the points regarding that particularly
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where our definition of
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
charity is not very clear um but let's
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
just take a uh uh I think a C4 which is
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
an educational I think C4 is educational
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
is it social welfare organization social
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
well there's several social
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
welfare six 8 10 uh
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
but let's let's take a a
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
school so you have a
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
school and it may
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
be it's not profit because it's a
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
educational facility but it maybe it's a
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
um we'll go with B own Catholics because
 
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
um we'll go with B own Catholics because
it's

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
stereotypical um May maybe they're
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
running gaming to support presentation
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
of Mary down in Hudson could the
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
distribution agency then distribute
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
them to to a school to a a which is not
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
a 50 1
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
C3 um the language in this bill does not
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
preclude that I imagine that the
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
organization who that has this uh
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
recognition as a thirdparty intermediary
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
would need to be careful about how it
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
did its federal taxes to determine if
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
those distributions were consistent or
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the 501c3 purpose okay
 
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
another followup followup uh
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
finally who's going to oversee the
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
distribution agency and how much is that
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so if if
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is a 501c3 that is based in New
 
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or does business here it would
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
be required to register with and report
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
to the director of charitable trusts um
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
we uh would not typically get that deep
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
into the operations of a charity to
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
determine if every distribution that was
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
made was consistent with federal tax law
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's usually the irs's role um what
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
they would report to us is their their
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
IRS filings um their board uh
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
information their governance procedures
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
things like that um I suspect that
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
there's some role for the Lottery
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
Commission here as they're the ones who
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
are choosing um this third party
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
intermediary and who and whether they
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
would relicense them in the follow in
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
any following year um and there's a
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
reporting to the Lottery Commission
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
listed in this bill from my
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
understanding um but they would be
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
required to register and report to to
 
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.790 align:start position:0%
required to register and report to to
our

01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
office representative Malloy thank you
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Mr Haley for taking
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
my question uh this
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
may or may not be relevant to this
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
conversation but you mentioned that if I
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
think I caught this if a charity
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
501c3 uh goes out of
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
business you said the that the
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of that what's left of the
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
assets I think goes to the general
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
public is that because in many if I may
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
my my experience is that in in many
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
cases there is a uh plan laid out by
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
many of the 501c3 to go to a succeeding
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
organization or another
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
organization uh that's could you help me
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
with this sure I apologize if my comment
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
was not clear um what I was trying to
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
say was that uh a charity does not have
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
any owners so a typical Corporation the
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
members of the board of directors have
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
some ownership interest in the in the
 
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
chair in the organization and oftentimes
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
when the organization dissolves the
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
board of directors gets to keep
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
whatever's left around um they have some
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
kind of ownership stake in it um or the
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
share holders or whoever um with a
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
charity the ultimate beneficiaries of a
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
charity have to be the public and not
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
any individual so it's not possible to
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
have a an organization formed for
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes where if it
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
dissolves the board members or the
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
members get to retain those assets
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
typically as you said uh when a charity
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
is formed it's required to have a
 
01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
dissolution provision that's part of
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
their articles of agreement that are
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
filed with the secretary of state and
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
those must say that the upon dissolution
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
the assets go either to another 501c3 or
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
a government entity they are free to
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
prescribe more specifically if they have
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
a particular charity in mind or a
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
particular government entity but it at
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
best it must go to a c another C3 or uh
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
our government entity thank you you you
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
you got to my question thank you yeah
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um let's U Get representative
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
fellows let's try to we're way over
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
let's try to wrap up
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
quickly so I have a question about this
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
structure that's in the bill says that
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
the state will give the money transfer
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
the money to a
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
501c3 which is a charity and when they
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
fill out their
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
$199 is that the right number um they
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
are they going to show the money that
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
the state gives them
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
as making a CH doing charitable work and
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
then will the second
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
501c3 that the town that gets the money
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the football field or whatever
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
they're also going to show those same
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
dollars as charitable work which is kind
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
of double
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
counting thank you for the question um
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
so uh the I believe the form you're
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
thinking of is the the 990 the the IRS
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
form 990 um the IRS form 990 uh notes
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
the the General Revenue um it does not
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
provide a particularly detailed
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
breakdown of where money uh comes from
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
specifically so um sometimes uh there I
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
believe there's a line that says
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
government grants and I I suspect that's
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
where this would be categorized um
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
within the IRS form 990 there is a
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
schedule B that is filed with the IRS
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
but not filed with our office because it
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
is um it's confidential information that
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're not entitled to the schedule B
 
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
provides more detailed information about
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
specific donors specific organizations
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
that give grants and we don't have
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
access to that information so follow up
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm last last follow I'm asking about
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
when that the the identified charitable
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
third party Financial
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
intermediary sends the money to the the
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
more local entity that um is getting is
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
the re is this end that's going to spend
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the money when they do that are they
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
reporting that as a
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
charity yes they would also be reporting
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
that as as charitable income but that's
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
not a very unusual setup there are a lot
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
of organizations that are set up to
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
receive grants and then make sub grants
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
and sometimes those Sub grantees make
 
01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
further sub grants that's not an unusual
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
um setup for a charity can I just have
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
one more followup um no I'm going to end
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
it now thank you Mr Haley thank you very
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%

Danny

01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
Danny
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
Maloney thank you representative Aly
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
thank you could you just provide for me
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
where in the racing statutes it on says
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
this on that only live racing would be
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
covered by ADM ADW whatever it
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
is I mean certainly historically ADM has
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
only been live racing and so and current
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
it exists in that form only the three
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
operators that had been in New Hampshire
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
which is now to only ticket on live
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
racing and the players only want it on
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
live racing um you you couldn't do it on
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
historic racing because everyone would
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
cheat um you know nobody would not bet
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
on secretary at the Belmont um they you
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
know you would research your phone and
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
you would so it would be not a viable
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
product I don't think and certainly if
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's a concern for the legis we can fix
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
that in Ru making in terms of it has to
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
be a live wager but it's the only way
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's done currently now that I'm that
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of uh and there 28 states
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
where it exists yeah so in our laws in
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
the historic past before it came to
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
live correct
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
okay well since we have a new a new
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
speaker here um representative shamberg
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Ames thank
 
01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you director
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
McIntyre does Lottery support this
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 432 now that you've heard a
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
lot of this discussion
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
today do you have any other opinions on
 
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.669 align:start position:0%
today do you have any other opinions on
it

01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
um so by and large the lottery never
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
supported the expansion of gaming which
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
this the end of the day looked like it
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
was a little bit it's really the
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
recapturing of gaming but certainly
 
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
we've never historically said we're in
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
favor of gaming we did ask Senator Lang
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
to look at this in terms of clarifying
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
what had been a practice that existed um
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
because in many ways um we would rather
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
have that regulated market versus an
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
unregulated market and number of reasons
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
not just for the fact that there's
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
revenues to the state but also consumer
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
protections um in an unregulated Market
 
01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
that consumer is the one who doesn't
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
benefit really because there's no
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
appeals process with the state with us
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
um and certainly similarly when we were
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
appro we approached the Attorney
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
General's office regarding fantasy
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
sports and we thought fantasy sports was
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
not legal DraftKings and FanDuel went
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
and had a bill passed and fantasy sports
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
was UN legalized in the state which we
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
now regulate followup Mr chairman
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
followup uh have you had this bill
 
01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed or not the
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill has the AG's office uh reviewed the
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
legality of
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
ADW here in this state and that's why we
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
have this outcome of this legislation
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
would you say correct it was when we
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
approached the topic with the Attorney
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
General's office it was suggested then
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
that we clarify it by a bill which would
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
clarify and be based on other bills in
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
other states that also clarified
 
01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:23.719 --> 01:30:25.709 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman thank you
repres

01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
Ames on the charal uh it's not charal
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
gaming the uh chable part of this bill
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
that was inserted apparently in
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
executive session in the Senate's
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
deliberations and um my question is
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether you think that that uh is a
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
workable model and if the numbers that
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
there have been assumed 200 roughly
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
$200,000 are in the ballpark I mean
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
certainly anything's workable um you
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
know I I often say we don't make policy
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
with the instruments of policy and so if
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
it's the legislator and the governor's
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
wish to do this then we'll certainly
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
administer it the best we
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
would over 200,000 yes yes I think
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's right I will tell you that
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
historically when you legalize a
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
activity it tends to grow the
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
revenue not that this is a problem area
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know this is not like sports betting
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
was where it's a bookmaker and a sports
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
bar um but if you legalize the market
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
you tend to grow it thank you
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
representative D I don't mean to belabor
 
01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
this but thank you for taking my
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
question director but we heard some
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
testimony from someone earlier that
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
stated that the Lottery Commission has
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
no authority to regul at ADW is that
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
your position the lottery has no
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate ADW at present I
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
think that's a finer Point than that uh
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for the
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
question um current ADW that exists now
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
we have the authority to regulate the
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate what is online
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
gaming and horse racing for ADW I think
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
was in a I hate to use the words gray
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
area but was in a gray area the lottery
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
has the authority to promulgate
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding Advanced deposit
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
wagering and it doesn't clearly find
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
that that Authority pre-exists the
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
internet and so it's one of those areas
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
where we haven't cleaned it up to comfor
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
technology so that ansers your question
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
quick followup I know we have to move on
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
so 284 RSA 284 and parool
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
525 doesn't lay it out clearly enough it
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
does it doesn't so there are certain
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
laws that exist pre-exist the internet
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
and pre-exist online and so
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
certainly in the abundance of caution
 
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
candidly I would rather seek the
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
approval of the legislature for doing
 
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
something than doing it myself be if
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
that makes sense follow up I don't mean
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
to belabor this and thank you for the
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
followup um do you know when the power
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
pool 525 rule came into place it was
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
well into the internet age if if my
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
information's right about 98 99 I
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
honestly there was before my time and
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%

01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
is necessary and the bill before you
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 546 is an effort to ensure
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
the grant-funded programs have
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement Fidelity that accurately
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
reflects the processes under which the
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
elip program functions I am pleased to
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
bring Senate Bill 546 with the wind at
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
its back having come out of committee in
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate with unanimous recommend
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
ation of ought to pass and a passage on
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the cons consent calendar while I am
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
thrilled to have had the experience of
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
serving on the board of directors for
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
the past year and a half the details of
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
Grant applications Awards and
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
managements are still relatively new to
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
me and I am on the upswing of my
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
learning curve so I am also thrilled to
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
have El Chip's executive director Paula
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
Belmore and board chair Ben Willcox here
 
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
with me to provide the precise answers
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
to questions you may have about the
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to RSA 227
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
M3 and thank you for your time and
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
attention this morning I will turn over

yeah that's that's fine yes thank you
 
01:36:40.199 --> 01:36:40.910 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's fine yes thank you

thank
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
great good morning and thanks for
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak this morning um my
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
name is Ben Wilcox I'm the chair of
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
lchip and I've been on the board of
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
directors since uh
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
2017 so um I'm here to express the
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
board's support for sb4 uh
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
546 um the El chip board includes four
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
legislative seats appointed by the
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
Senate President and Speaker of the
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
House these seats are currently filled
 
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
by Senators Bradley and Al Schiller and
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
representatives eel and ren Zulo all of
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
who sponsored this bill since its first
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh round in 2001 elip has been highly
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
effective and as a result enjoys broad
 
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
public support and perhaps as a test
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
Testament to the good work of the Blue
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
Ribbon committee that led to its
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
creation the original framework for the
 
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
program stands for the most part as
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
adopted however over the last 23 years
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
best practi practices in land
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
conservation and historic preservation
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
have evolved based in part on our
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
experience with the various types of
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
legal Arrangements used to accomplish
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
the program's goals some we've learned
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
work well and others not so well that
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
evolution of thinking has led to the
 
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
need for SB
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
546 which seeks to remove a requirement
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the state be granted an executory
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
interest in each lchip funded easement
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
to secure the Public's in investment the
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
lchip statute places three specific
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
requirements on lchip funded e on an
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
easement first it must uh be held by a
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
qualified entity second it must be held
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
um in public trust by the state and
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
third it must Grant an executory
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
interest to the state El Chip's program
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
rules add a fourth requirement that elip
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
rtain illegal right to enforce any any
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
easement and funds further protecting
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
the Public's interest so that's four
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
four areas to focus on the bill before
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
you today seeks to remove the third of
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
those four requirements the executory
 
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
interest but leaves the other three
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Protections in place um after Consulting
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office at
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
length we understand that the executory
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
interest requirement isn't necessary to
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
protect the Public's investment that
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
investment is well protected by the
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
other three
 
01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
requirements as stated in the memo from
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice that has been
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
provided to you removing the executory
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
interest requirement will not diminish
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to protect its
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
investment and uphold the public trust
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
so in closing I just like to reiterate
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
that the lchip
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
board supports this change and we urge
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote ought to pass for
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
S SP
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
546 which will reduce the administ ative
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
burden placed on lchip the state the
 
01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
grant recipients while retaining the
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
state's ability to defend the Public's
 
01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.030 align:start position:0%
state's ability to defend the Public's
trust

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
investment um today I have uh Paula
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
bellamore here the executive director to
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
help me answer any questions along with
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
attorney Alan Brooks from the Department
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
of Justice so I guess we can open it up
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
to questions thank you I guess I have um
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
I have two questions um to start um we
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
talk about the executory interest not
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
being needed I understand the the
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
thought behind that but there's two
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
other areas that have changed here in
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill the first being on line five
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
the word acquire being crossed out and
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
the word provide
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
funding um that seems to me like a major
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
change because now
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
where how are they providing how is Ela
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
providing funding I guess that's a
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for your question
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the program elip
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
has not directly acquired interests
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
instead we provide a grant to a sub
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
agency who then acquires that interest
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
for example a land trust or a community
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
a town so um what I can tell you from my
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
research and reading is that when the
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
elip program was first introduced sp sp
 
01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
401 it actually did propose that elip
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
would first acquire resource and then
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
convey it to a partner agency such as a
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
land trust that was changed during the
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
legislative process to a becoming a
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
grant making program which we are today
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
and is how we've always operated I think
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
it was just a you know a scer error
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
level um mistake we have never acquired
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
directly um
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
resources okay um and I guess my second
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
question is on line
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
27 um acquisition of
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
resource assets or related and now it's
 
01:41:51.639 --> 01:41:53.390 align:start position:0%
resource assets or related and now it's
um

01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry draw upon funds for the
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
acquisition of now it's draw upon funds
 
01:41:59.950 --> 01:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
for program purposes that seems like a
 
01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.950 align:start position:0%
for program purposes that seems like a
much

01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
broader thank you yes it is it is
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
broader although um I would point you to
 
01:42:08.790 --> 01:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
the original statute or the to RSA 227 M
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
which does have other program purposes
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
Beyond acquiring resource assets for
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
example historic Rehabilitation which is
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
you about 50% of our program work and
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't doesn't require the
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
acquisition of assets so we're simply
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify that the program
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
purposes which are spelled out in
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
statute are we draw upon funds for those
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you um representative
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you Mr chair mainly
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the chair would we say that most of
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
these changes really are in the area of
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
housekeeping if really you're not going
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
to see much difference from the outside
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
but we're more clarifying on what's was
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
in the previous legislation
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to determine yeah
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I think uh I don't want to make a
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
definitive statement on that right now
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to get to that
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
elme oh I thought I turned it on sorry
 
01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
on on line 13 on you've
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
removed the legal obligations attached
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity and that's a very
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
important part but is it just considered
 
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
to be part of the easement
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
interests thank you for the question um
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
easement interests should be recorded in
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
the easement deed but there are other
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
legal obligations that are grantees
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
accept for example an obligation to post
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
signs on the property or to acknowledge
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
the El chip Grant to monitor the
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
property on an annual basis those
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
obligations aren't appropriate in a real
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
estate deed they are memorialized in a
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
grant contract or a grant agreement that
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
we enter into so it's along the same
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
lines of the first two changes we've
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
doing yes representative Bolton thank
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair this just a clarification
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
so on line 16 of page one it says the
 
01:44:12.589 --> 01:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
authority is authorized what's Authority
 
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
in reference to elip is an independent
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
authority of the state so in the statute
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
the program is or the the board is often
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
referred to as the authority
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
and I think um attorney Brooks would
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
probably be more appropriate to explain
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
what an authority is as opposed to the
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
program in the board because it's okay
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
above my pay pay grade thank you
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you um I
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
might understand this a little bit
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
better if I knew what
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
executory whatever is um but in terms of
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
Deeds so am I correct in assuming that
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
lchip may makes Deeds for conservation
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
easements so I think your first the
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
two-part question your first part is is
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
would probably be helpful for a lot of
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
people an executory interest is a
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
contingent future right of in a in
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
property so it's a right that can be
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
exercised based on certain future
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
conditions so in other words the state
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
could hold the easement or take the
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
easement if certain conditions had been
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
met those conditions would be for
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
example if the land trust stopped
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
enforcing and attorney Brooks can get
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
into the details of why they already
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
have that right under public trust but
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what an executory
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
interest is it's often um in the land
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
conservation Community people think that
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
an executory interest is simply a right
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
to enforce it is not it is a right to
 
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
actually hold the property or the
 
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
resource asset so it's a very important
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
difference um and the second part of
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
your question was oh Deeds so elip does
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
not convey property because we never
 
01:45:58.830 --> 01:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
acquired the property instead we provide
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
funding to an entity who then purchases
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
the property usually from a private land
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
owner so we award a grant to the land
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
trust they use that money to buy an
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
easement on a farm so the deed is being
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
conveyed from the farmer to the land
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
trust elip is a party to that because we
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
take a right of enforcement to ensure
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we can uphold the investment the
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
state's investment but we aren't
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
actually conveying
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
or accepting the
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
deed follow
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
up so I'm trying to figure out the way
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing it or suggesting to do it
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
if if the farmer is holding the
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
deed do
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
it what happens if he sells it
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
and you know somebody wants to like
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
build houses on it sure so is there will
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
there be something in the deed that says
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
you can't do that and if you try to do
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the state's going to get it back or
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
right so with an easement it's almost
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
like you have two layers of ownership so
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have owner of the land the property
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
and then when we acquire an easement
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
we're taking a portion of those property
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
rights which are for example the right
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
to build houses on it and that's what
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the land trust acquires so then you have
 
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.470 align:start position:0%
the land trust acquires so then you have
two

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
Deeds remembering that a deed is a legal
 
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
document right so you have two documents
 
01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:29.719 align:start position:0%
one is the title deed to the property
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
which the farmer still holds and the
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
other is the easement in the property
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
which is held by the land trust and that
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
runs with the land so no matter who owns
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
it that easement
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
stands follow up so I I thought that
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
easements were in a deed are you saying
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's a separate document or is it like a
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
second chapter or something an easement
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
deed is a separate document from the
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
title deed or the from the fee deed so
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
if you owned land that had an easement
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
on it there would be two Deeds there
 
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
would be the the deed to the property
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
itself and the easement deed I I think
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
in attorney Brooks could correct me I
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
think it's possible to have it all
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
rolled into one I'm not sure um about
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
that but two different pieces of paper
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
i' I think I've seen it all rolled
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
into yeah I mean I I've definitely Deeds
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
where it's all rolled into one but it
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
could be as she says separate it could
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
be separate Mr chairman yes just just to
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
clarify it's typical that someone will
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
already have acquired a property and be
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
the owner and deed was recorded to
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
document that
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
transfer now at some point in the future
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
while owning it that owner may choose to
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
Grant an easement could be to the power
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
company could be to the town could be
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
for conservation purposes there's a wide
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
range so they're they're most ordinarily
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
separated in time and uh the one becomes
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
subject to the
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
other thank you uh representative Malloy
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
taking this
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
question is this an example of what we
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
did in Greenland with the southeast land
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
trust and the El chip situation because
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is great because it's the first
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
time I've really understood the whole
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
thing with your your testimony that's
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's my question thank you um thank
 
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes in the case of
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
the um Farm in Greenland the southeast
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
land trust and Brian Hart their
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
executive director happens to be here
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
today um received an elip Grant which
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
they will use I don't think that has
 
01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.589 align:start position:0%
they will use I don't think that has
closed

01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
closed
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
yet April 30th um and they'll use those
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
funds to acquire an easement um just as
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
was explained the farmer already owns
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
the land but will sell the easement y
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
it you're right it is April 30th and I'm
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
also a trustee of trust funds and I need
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
to uh we need to make sure you get a
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
check by the end of this month thank

Southworth H thank you Mr chair I'd like
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
to start where we kind of ended last
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
time which was with all these waiting
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
lists um which we were trying to double
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
check were there in fact going to be any
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
slots open to municipalities
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
really that's um that's a good question
 
01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
um represent Aly would you like to take
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
that well we forgot to ask the relevant
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
people if we had them here but I was
 
01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
people if we had them here but I was
assured

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
assured
 
01:53:49.629 --> 01:53:49.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday that this would be
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:00.069 --> 01:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
apply I'm trying to remember exactly
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
um well he's asking if the towns uh or
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
cities would have a chance oh yes at
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
this yes he that was it um that that he
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
was assured that legally the not
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
withstanding any provision of law to the
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
contrary which is what I thought in line
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
seven of page two is
 
01:54:29.639 --> 01:54:31.189 align:start position:0%
seven of page two is
um

01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
on rules over everything that follows it
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
in that set in that
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
subsection uh in 4 a namely
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
that because it's not withstanding any
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
provisional law to contrary on the game
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
operators are
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
required um to annually operate a
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
minimum of seven but not more than game
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
10 game dates for the benefit of the
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
town or city
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
on rules over at least that's the way I
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
understood it sections Roman 2 3 and
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
4 that would allow the
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
charity to all the the Charities
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
to acquire
 
01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.510 align:start position:0%
to acquire
time

01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
that now maybe I misunderstood it
 
01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday but
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
um that would in insist that the
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities be involved in
 
01:55:43.679 --> 01:55:45.550 align:start position:0%
municipalities be involved in
this

01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.109 align:start position:0%
this
um

01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh going to go to
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative ducet and I I think can
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe more directly address
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative southworth's question I
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
personally think it's a moot point and
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
from the information that I'm getting
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
there are so many Charities I don't
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
believe there'll be that uh opportunity
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to capture this um I
 
01:56:13.629 --> 01:56:13.639 align:start position:0%
and I spoke to some of my counterparts
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
here I've spoken to an attorney that
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
tells me that this language is Rock
 
01:56:22.589 --> 01:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
Solid um and that the charities will get
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
the preference we have waiting lists
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
geographical um so it's my firm belief
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to see this effect
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
municipality anytime soon because that
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
was as you well aware that was my major
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
concern so I'm I'm not necessarily
 
01:56:44.830 --> 01:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
concerned with that any
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
longer thank you representative Aly and
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
then follows yes I do not understand
 
01:56:54.069 --> 01:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
that the not withstanding any provision
 
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
of law to the contrary because we all
 
01:57:00.990 --> 01:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
know that if there are any game dates
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
open still in uh in the the game
 
01:57:07.079 --> 01:57:08.510 align:start position:0%
open still in uh in the the game
operating

01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
schedules they're they must be in
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
Berlin which doesn't produce very much
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
money uh for the charity that would take
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
it from Lebanon say
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
so Roman
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
1 says the game operators have to
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
provide a minimum of s days annually to
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
the city or town where they are and two
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
impossible represent to7
 
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is that first
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
sentence not withstanding any provision
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
of law to the contrary right now in law
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's goes to a
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
charity goes to a charity first and
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
foremost and if the there is the charity
 
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
list is exhausted or another charity
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
can't be and I contend we have plenty of
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
Charities and they will continue to
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
apply that supersedes
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
anything thereafter yes and that's what
 
01:58:27.550 --> 01:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
with that I don't agree with because it
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
says not withstanding law that already
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
exists but the notwithstanding would
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
also I would presume the notwithstanding
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
would also refer to even this if it
 
01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.550 align:start position:0%
would also refer to even this if it
passes

01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
Ames it doesn't that mean there all this
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
language is just a waste of space um
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
that uh there's
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
um post communities are not are not
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
saying yeah that's what you're saying um
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
because of the numbers of Charities that
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
were out there and the waiting list and
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
all that stuff means
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
that although this sounds nice host
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
communities aren't going to get anything
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
right do I have it right I I totally
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
agree and I think
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh wh whomever authored this it may make
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
that person um happy to see that as a
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
fallback I don't believe it's ever going
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
to become that fallback so
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
I my my feeling is that given that
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
case that within this Frame that we're
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
talking about here this language should
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
not be here it's just confusing uh if
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
anything and um it should be amended out
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
out on the other hand I also think that
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
there is legitimacy to the notion that
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
host communities incur costs and uh
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
there should be some way of providing
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
for that um it's an issue that comes up
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
it was an issue I remember that was
 
02:00:13.069 --> 02:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
addressed in that big gaming bill that
 
02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:17.719 align:start position:0%
I engineered years and years ago um host
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
communities incur costs and it's often a
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
debated issue because some people think
 
02:00:25.709 --> 02:00:25.719 align:start position:0%
casinos sort of
 
02:00:29.069 --> 02:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
engender other kinds of activities and
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
that and people argue about that but
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
still I think basically there's going to
 
02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
be a call for police response to issues
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
arguments that develop on site and uh
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
and so forth and more cars and just it's
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
natural it's going to happen um and
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
money is floating around so um I I feel
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
that issue needs to be addressed I
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
suspect it's going to be uh considered
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be addressed I don't
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
know it comes back to that gaming
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
commission that I happen to sit on uh
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
you're on it too and um we'll be working
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
through that um so one of the puzzles
 
02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
that I have as we look at bills like
 
02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
this is do we really need
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
this um as we're we know that in
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
parallel to this process there's
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
something more comprehensive that's
 
02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
digging a little further into the issue
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
I think the one one part of this that's
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
needed relates to the
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
moratorium um there if we continue to
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
fail to pass legislation on
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
the uh restriction of licenses to a
 
02:01:45.069 --> 02:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
finite group of
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
entities um we as a legislature and
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
Governor working together then
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to roll by June 30th and
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
there'll be no restriction that's my
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
understanding um so um I feel we need to
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
do something we've already sent one bill
 
02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
to the Senate it's still sitting there
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell 112 Senate Bill
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
112 um and in that one I think you you
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
helped to engineer the representative
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
set um and that uh that one uh froze the
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
number of uh entities at the uh the
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
original whatever 15 or whatever Plus
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
those in the pipeline as of a certain
 
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
set of dates and uh and that does the
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
trick that sets that contains this this
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill um has
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
a has an end dat to that new Arrangement
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
um seven years out if I remember
 
02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
correctly and that's I guess work well
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
it seems a little long to me but um you
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
know I I've learned to be flexible in
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
this business um and uh so that's the
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
one piece of this I may be missing
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
something else that's essential and we
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
could uh we could amend this bill
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
and and um send it to the floor and if
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
it came came out it could be just
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
focused exclusively on the uh this issue
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
of um of uh
 
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh moratorium this moror the limits uh
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
issue and uh drop the other stuff I
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we'd be dropping
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
important stuff I I just put that out
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
there that we maybe need to focus on how
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
we get to what we've got to get to um
 
02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
and push that issue and maybe deal with
 
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
these other things too I don't know I
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
just I've talked too much representative
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
you said if I may and I I know we're in
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
agreement with this and I I think the
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
moratorium is the important component
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
here and it allow for us to have that
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
time we've spoken about many times to
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
review and and find out where this is
 
02:04:04.109 --> 02:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
going where where we are right now and
 
02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
also to this language specific to the
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities I may think it's
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
moot you may think it's
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary somebody thinks it's
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
important enough to put in there and and
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
for for the sake of argument yes the
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities take on incur a cost this
 
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
is an acknowledgement at least in this
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation of that and and
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's and then we need to work towards
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
in the commission but I don't think
 
02:04:34.549 --> 02:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's a need I I think we should take
 
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
this this piece as written move it
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
forward so there's no opportunity for
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
the other body to yet again amend or do
 
02:04:44.549 --> 02:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
something in a committee or conference
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
that might send the sideways because we
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
do not want to allow for June 30 to come
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
and the Wild West to ensue as far as
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
HHR so that would be that would be my
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
personal opinion I I I agree with you
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative D said in fact that that
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
was my thing one of the reasons I would
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
like to leave this unchanged is for that
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
you you spoke about things are getting
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
delayed and tied up if we pass this as
 
02:05:12.669 --> 02:05:12.679 align:start position:0%
it is it moves on to the governor this
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
get us to yes
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
yeah uh did you have a question
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
Representative no I was just going to
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
say that I agree with everything that
 
02:05:27.069 --> 02:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
I've heard okay uh representative
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
Southworth yes I agree too I phras it
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
different at the beginning I do
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
understand if we just send it back as is
 
02:05:35.149 --> 02:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
that still may get us where we want to
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
go yes thank you representative PL I was
 
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
just going to say I hate to say I agreed
 
02:05:43.629 --> 02:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
with representative this said but I do
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
many have the same
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
feelings all right I think we will uh
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
move on from this we'll close the work
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
out next uh open I'll open the next work
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
session on SB 432 relative to Advanced
 
02:06:16.679 --> 02:06:19.669 align:start position:0%
session on SB 432 relative to Advanced
deposit

02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
wagering representative PL
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
I want to kill this bill to to me that
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill got passed it gives a it
 
02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
gives Credence to the history where
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
nobody was paying anything and operating
 
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
illegally and uh so I want to address
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
that issue before we pass anything like
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
this okay representative ducet yeah and
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
I agree and we've all sat through the
 
02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
testimony here and what we did with s
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
sp190 which is the exact same language
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
here and the money was going to the
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
exact place in my estimation it should
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
have went instead of creating another
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
entity to distribute what funds may be
 
02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
to what charities may be fact remains is
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
we have Statute in law right now
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
everybody that came up here including
 
02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
the lottery director said this is a gray
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
area I suggest it's a great area because
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
somebody dropped the ball here and we we
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
can't be kicking this can down the road
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
we we can address it going forward but
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
the fact remains is everyone's on point
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
we we had somebody testifying for one of
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
these people saying they all said it was
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
legal but they all said it was a a gray
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
area okay and if it if if it was legal
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't a problem there's two
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
outlets still taking bets why are they
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
here lobbying us to make them pay that
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
1.25% you know the pieces just don't
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
come together for me so I I my position
 
02:07:59.470 --> 02:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
is we itl this and and we get some
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
action on
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't that what I'm sorry Mr
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
chairman isn't that what this is re
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
asking us to do put some action on it
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
now versus kicking it down the road
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
again what we are asking to to have some
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations we have rules and
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
regulations on everything else and here
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're saying ah we're not going to put
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
rules or regulations here representative
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
do it's my belief and my contention that
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
if one particular and I I've called this
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
out before if one particular AG doesn't
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
pursue this doesn't necessarily mean
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
another AG won't pursue this so if it's
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
legal take the bets you've been put on
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
point because under what I've heard in
 
02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
testimony I think you and I
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative should stop start a
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
website and start taking bets on simal
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
cast racing today because it's Le legal
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's a ww west because we don't have
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
Statute in place to to we have written
 
02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
statute that specifically outlines simoc
 
02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
cast live racing we have rules that I
 
02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:13.559 align:start position:0%
quoted earlier that specifically I found
 
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
out it was
 
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
1997 that uh parool 125 rule came into
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
place specifically for ADW the there is
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
one provider in the state of New
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who can legally take bets and
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
it goes to the interstate racing act to
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
states that in order to take a
 
02:09:37.629 --> 02:09:37.639 align:start position:0%
bet the state in which the bet is made
 
02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
it must be
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
legal comply with the laws of that
 
02:09:45.629 --> 02:09:45.639 align:start position:0%
state the state where the BET originates
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
it must be legal comply with the laws of
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
that state it's not happening in New
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it has hasn't happened in
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
here representative elme followed by
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
Olie yeah I also do not understand
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
why what I do not believe any attorney
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
general would be following up trying to
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
accuse these places of a crime so that
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
they can get a penalty out of them
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
because I don't think the penalty could
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
end up being very much
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
money uh and we can't pass law that's
 
02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
punitive so we can't get it back that
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
way um punitive backwards
 
02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.270 align:start position:0%
way um punitive backwards
um

02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
so so I think we might as well go ahead
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
and get this thing into a
 
02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.549 align:start position:0%
and get this thing into a
a

02:10:53.549 --> 02:10:53.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
legal position I just want to make very
 
02:11:01.629 --> 02:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
sure that they never put in accounts
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
online accounts for slot
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
machines because too many people who
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't have much money could end up
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
up wouldn't crack this seal
 
02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.149 align:start position:0%
up wouldn't crack this seal
thank

02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
you I I'm I'm really confused and and
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
when I was talking with the individuals
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
I hope that was apparent because we got
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
an argument that
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
says that it's legal and we have an
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.549 --> 02:11:44.559 align:start position:0%
illegal and the argument that
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative duett is making says that
 
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
we already have rules in place so this
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation isn't necessary because we
 
02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
have rules in place but the argument
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
that the people putting this forward say
 
02:12:00.189 --> 02:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:04.559 align:start position:0%
have rules so the question is do we have
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
rules or don't we have rules and the AG
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
never answered that so I don't know
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
where we are do if do we have rules or
 
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
don't we have
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
rules or I shouldn't say rules
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
laws representative El me we have laws
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
for live racing we don't have laws for
 
02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:29.589 align:start position:0%
for live racing we don't have laws for
online

02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
betting of live racing no that's not
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's incorrect that's incorrect parool
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and I'll send you a copy of it yeah
 
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
we that was established in
 
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
97 lays out what Advanced deposit
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
follow and it does talk about internet
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
well know if it specifically talks about
 
02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
I can send it to you so look yeah that
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be nice we do have R it or we do
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
have a law we do have and the law talks
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
about live
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
racing and it talks about Advanced
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
deposit wagering is that
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
correct say again representative duet
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative I believe that's correct
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
let me pull up this rule here I'm going
 
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
question Advanced deposit wagering can
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
be done in person I think that's what
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
the law is is indicating at the present
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
point that you can go to someone and say
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
I want to put this down and over the
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
next few week she'll say I'd like to put
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
this amount of money to them to them on
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
this race this race this race and
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
someone will send that off I think this
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
is our electronic age has put us in a a
 
02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:03.870 align:start position:0%
is our electronic age has put us in a a
little

02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
quandry of how we are going to do at
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
Advanced deposit
 
02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
wagering I don't think we have an answer
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
on it and I think someone is trying to
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
say let's let's get this clear now and
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
this would clear up
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm going to send it to you folks
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
but but I brought this issue up
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
specifically with
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery years ago and was told it was
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
passed on to the AG okay years ago at
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
least 4 to five years ago I sat with the
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
AG last year before this legislation
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
started coming
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
generated I was told by Lottery was
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
passed on to the AG when I approached
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
them four or five years ago I want to
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
say it's about five years ago when I sat
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
with the AG the AG said I just heard
 
02:15:04.109 --> 02:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
about it last month okay I have issue
 
02:15:06.549 --> 02:15:06.559 align:start position:0%
here somebody dropped the ball if I
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't collecting if I wasn't collecting
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue correctly let's correct it
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
but to me there's there's too many too
 
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
many missing pieces and I don't think we
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
should Co cover this up
 
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
and and not address what's owed to the
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
state in revenue and I still go back to
 
02:15:31.629 --> 02:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
the days I'm from Salem Rockingham Park
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
these these uh online Outlets
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
incentivized people not to go to
 
02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Park not to go to seab Brook
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
incentivized 5% bet with us online will
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
give you an extra five bucks on your
 
02:15:50.669 --> 02:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
hundred okay plus didn't pay the tax so
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
there's Revenue loss to Brick and Mortar
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
business here too and if if you can what
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
you want this this is the truth this is
 
02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
you want this this is the truth this is
the

02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
truth representative spillsbury thank
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um separate from and
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
aside from representative duet's
 
02:16:16.589 --> 02:16:16.599 align:start position:0%
reservations I think this bill is just
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
begging to be integrated into a broader
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
strategy of charitable gaming and that's
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
why we adopted a bill to create the
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
commission which is still working on
 
02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
that subject uh so I think that the bill
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
has gotten all the more confused by the
 
02:16:34.589 --> 02:16:34.599 align:start position:0%
addition of the provisions uh in the
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
Senate executive uh session on
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming we've got an estimated
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
$200,000 at stake we have according to
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Haley
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
1,600 charitable organizations that are
 
02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:49.469 align:start position:0%
1,600 charitable organizations that are
potentially

02:16:49.469 --> 02:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
eligible and uh um and we have you know
 
02:16:58.349 --> 02:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of a very vague concept of
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
dispersing equitably throughout the
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
state I'd like to see this reworked I
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure that these Provisions
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
even belong in this bill but if they do
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear that from the
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
commission with a more integrated um
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
plan so I would suggest we um not move
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
forward with this
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
02:17:21.479 --> 02:17:23.110 align:start position:0%
bill uh
representative

02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you Mr chair uh just
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
briefly as we keep going it seems like
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
there are more questions than answers
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
which to me says the bill isn't
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
ready representative fellows um yes I
 
02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
would uh just like to share with you my
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about the um the whole strategy
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
for that charitable third party being
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
able to figure out how to distribute
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
assuming assuming that that they uh had
 
02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
money to work with um how assuming that
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
they had 200,000 and they get 10% of
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
that to do the administrative work to
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
pass out those grants that that is is
 
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
not feasible you can't do that with 20
 
02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:11.230 align:start position:0%
not feasible you can't do that with 20
million

02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
$20,000 and and I'll tell you why
 
02:18:15.389 --> 02:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
because these are the steps that they
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
would have to go
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
through so first step would be they have
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
to advertise the opportunity to apply
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
for the grants then they'd have to of
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
the grants they get back they'd request
 
02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:30.599 align:start position:0%
um applications they'd have to verify
 
02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
that the organization was eligible then
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
they'd have to read the
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
applications and they'd have to convene
 
02:18:45.309 --> 02:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
a group of people to rank the proposals
 
02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
and select some of them you can't you
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
can't designate that to a single person
 
02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:51.870 align:start position:0%
can't designate that to a single person
to

02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
do and then they'd have to notify the
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
winner winners they'd have to distribute
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
the grant money they'd have to have some
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
kind of audit procedures to make sure
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
that the money was really being spent
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the particular activity that the
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
grant asked for the money for and then
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
for the places that didn't um didn't do
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
what they proposed to do for whatever
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
reason youd have to figure out how
 
02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to get that money returned
 
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
so you can't do that for $20,000 a
 
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
year representative shamberg I go back
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
to representative set again did you send
 
02:19:33.309 --> 02:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
that yet that what you were looking for
 
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
meeting all right but my question goes
 
02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
to this um
 
02:19:51.399 --> 02:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
to this um
does

02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
ADW uh overlap with any other online uh
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh gambling or is it a separate unit
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
separate and we're letting Revenue that
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
we should be getting in the state
 
02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.790 align:start position:0%
we should be getting in the state
here

02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
let's let's go after it let's this bill
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
sort of puts us on that path toward
 
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
so if you find that information let me
 
02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
so if you find that information let me
know

02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:20:35.710 --> 02:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
Ames double up
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
his yes representative elberger thank
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I um agree with
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
that I that this needs to be part of a
 
02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:53.790 align:start position:0%
that I that this needs to be part of a
larger

02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
larger
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
encompassing Bill about dealing with
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and
 
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
I will therefore agree with
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth that this bill
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
is not yet ready for prime time so I'll
 
02:21:09.389 --> 02:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
not be supporting it thank
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you I think we're we've
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
exhausted this one um I'm going to close
 
02:21:18.429 --> 02:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
the work
 
02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
59 oh okay
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open the work session
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.389 --> 02:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
597 uh representative PL yes first of
 
02:21:48.429 --> 02:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
all this bill does not apply to Lucky 7
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's still done by paper some of them
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
are this is only with it's done through
 
02:21:57.710 --> 02:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
a machine and the testimony was that uh
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the the people uh requiring to pick out
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh to print out uh tickets is archaic
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
because people uh playing The Lucky
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
Seven don't want them they just leave
 
02:22:12.349 --> 02:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
them there and uh it's Noah the state
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
requires this and it's harder to get the
 
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.710 --> 02:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
um we've got a discussion going on over
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
here y it's harder to get these machines
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
that they're becoming difficult to get
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
so this to me is a no-brain of the
 
02:22:32.319 --> 02:22:33.870 align:start position:0%
so this to me is a no-brain of the
pass

02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay any other thoughts representative
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh Southworth uh thank you I agree with
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative PL and I would say
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
literally this is a housekeeping
 
02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
Bill okay representative
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
fellows so you know this is my second
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
year on this committee and learning
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
about um all the different games of
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
chance that we have but my we passed a
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill last year that had to do with the
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven tickets and it I think it
 
02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
allowed people to have more time
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
something related to the machines I I'm
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
just getting the impression that these
 
02:23:21.550 --> 02:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
are just turning into slot machines
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's what it sounds like to me because
 
02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
there you know first first it was paper
 
02:23:29.309 --> 02:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
tickets and then it was you could do
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
paper tickets or on the video screen and
 
02:23:34.510 --> 02:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
then we did something last year that
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
made it easier you could play more games
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
or faster on the video machines and now
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
we're saying you know let's just get rid
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the Paper Tickets all all all
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
together I don't think it's lucky s
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
anymore I think it sounds like a slot
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
machine representative jet yeah that
 
02:23:53.150 --> 02:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's not the case what what these it's
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
an electronic version of the pole tab
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
ticket okay it's they're deal sizes
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
provided by Lottery there's so many
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
winners in a deal of say a thousand
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
tickets it it has no Randomness other
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
than the deal size itself what this
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation talks about is in
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
those electronic versions of the pull
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
tickets they generate a paper receipt a
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
paper ticket for lack of a better term
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and they end up falling on the floor
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
because they're useless they just
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
generate a piece of paper so the paper
 
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
Lobby I'm sure is happy about that but
 
02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
the fact remains is there's no need and
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony to that this in no
 
02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
way shape of form changes the game
 
02:24:40.990 --> 02:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
changes anything about it it's still the
 
02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
same as if you were going to buy and
 
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
pull those three tabs and see if you get
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
the three bars yeah oh yeah oh yeah and
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
the machines are an electronic version
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
of that we we can talk to Lottery if we
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
want but that's exactly what they
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
are yes takes eliminates the the receipt
 
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
basically I believe that in the hearing
 
02:25:06.590 --> 02:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
we were told by Valerie King that there
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
is a requirement that you
 
02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
cannot uh that the button cannot be
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
repressed within six
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
seconds I think it is f three seconds
 
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the slot machine oh sorry the
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing machine is how
 
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
much that you can do it
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
in you don't
 
02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:32.830 align:start position:0%
in you don't
know

02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
um Miss King do you want to come up here
 
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
second what
 
02:25:39.279 --> 02:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
second what
was

02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah you can ask ask good morning King
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire lottery yeah
 
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative duet could could you
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.389 --> 02:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
what how the Lucky 7 Draw Works and and
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
the electronic version of the Lucky 7
 
02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
machines just so because there seems to
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
be so many components here in gaming
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
seems to be some confusion relative to
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
right now that specific device so if you
 
02:26:16.269 --> 02:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
don't mind right so uh representative
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
duet is correct that it is a lucky s
 
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
deal has a set number of tickets with a
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
certain number of winners and losers
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
which is not the same as a slot machine
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
which is random uh total random of when
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
you win or or lose um the amount of time
 
02:26:34.710 --> 02:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
for the tickets I believe is 3 second
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
set set by rule and uh historic horse
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
racing it it doesn't speak to that it it
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
there is some time in between but it
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing said in in rule or
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
represent yeah U my concern with with
 
02:26:59.550 --> 02:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
electronic machines is simply the addic
 
02:27:02.429 --> 02:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
how addictive is it and I believe that
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
three seconds of course this is when
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
they were trying to sell us the historic
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines uh that uh they
 
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
are estimated at 3 seconds
 
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
also so um obviously the Lucky 7 machine
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
it should be less addictive
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
but I actually I don't think I've seen
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
one working I've only been show showed
 
02:27:34.990 --> 02:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
the portable version we had to agree to
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
once it sounds like but it sounds like
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
the main difference is you either get a
 
02:27:41.710 --> 02:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
receipt or if this passes you don't get
 
02:27:44.349 --> 02:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
a receipt is that paper paper not a
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
receipt paper correct and I'd like to
 
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
also point out there is only one
 
02:27:49.269 --> 02:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that I'm aware of that
 
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
makes the paper and so they have a
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
monopoly and that can make it difficult
 
02:27:55.469 --> 02:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
we we had a time when it was difficult
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
to even obtain the paper and now we made
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
it so it was on demand and people aren't
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
even asking for the paper so effectively
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
we're operating in a paperless world as
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
it relates to Lucky 7
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay um okay we all said on this one it
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
looks good all right close the public
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
585 work session correct yeah I said
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
what did I say public hearing okay and I
 
02:28:38.269 --> 02:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I said previously but
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
I closed the work session on 597 if I
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
said public hearing I I apologize uh so
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the work session on SP 585 is now
 
02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:50.510 align:start position:0%
the uh the work session on SP 585 is now
open

02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative PL I always stick my neck
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
out by speaking first maybe I shouldn't
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
but uh to me this is a good change it
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
says if they're unpaid uh rooms and
 
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
meals taxes it's the managing entity who
 
02:29:06.269 --> 02:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
should be liable and who uh the state
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
should pursue not necessarily silent
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
interests that just have money in it not
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
no part of actually running the
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
organization so that that's that's the
 
02:29:18.910 --> 02:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
intent that's the rment of the bill and
 
02:29:21.309 --> 02:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
I support it
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you on my only problem with
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
the bill could be solved by
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment on it takes up members and it
 
02:29:36.910 --> 02:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
says on any person in a managerial
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
capacity of the limited liability
 
02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
company or we have we need a definition
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
of managerial I think on I have a um
 
02:29:50.429 --> 02:29:50.439 align:start position:0%
acquaintance in Lebanon who this
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
information about 10 years old now but
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
has had on 25 different
 
02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
llc's and about 10 of them now are on on
 
02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:06.750 align:start position:0%
llc's and about 10 of them now are on on
different

02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
on different
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
llc's owning each either a gas station
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
and a
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
on a gas station and a convenience store
 
02:30:25.469 --> 02:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
or on he's got one that is a coffee shop
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
he's got two now that are a coffee shop
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
and and a car
 
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
wash and um he doesn't manage those dayt
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
day he hires somebody who frequently he
 
02:30:43.710 --> 02:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
brings up from the guy who is stocking
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
the shelves to be there and handle the
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
money on that guy is not I know one of
 
02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
them quite well is not paid
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
enough that he would have any money you
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
could get away from him without putting
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
him in the poor farm so
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that in the case of limited
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
liability companies you you really need
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
to Define managerial to be the person
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
who tell I'm not sure what the legal
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
language would be but tells um the
 
02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
people in his employee uh how to do
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
things or or to add on to this uh any
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
person uh any
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
member on holding more than
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
say 30% of the of the a 30% share in the
 
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
business okay I I think we're pres
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
spillsbury may have an answer for
 
02:31:56.269 --> 02:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
that I I will come back to that but just
 
02:31:58.990 --> 02:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
more broadly I think this is a uh
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
significant bill that we should
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
pass uh unfortunately it sort of fits
 
02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
into a very very mky area of Law and uh
 
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
I I believe that uh representative oler
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
during our hearing very constructively
 
02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
suggested that maybe something that this
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee should put on its dock at the
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
future is a more comprehensive review of
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh corporate liability limitations of
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
liability and specifically liability for
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
tax related uh uh issues but in the
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
meantime I think the bill makes an
 
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
important step in the right
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
direction the fundamental purpose of
 
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
corporate law is to limit liability and
 
02:32:46.990 --> 02:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose to limit liability is to
 
02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
attract investment right so
 
02:32:53.870 --> 02:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
particular uh law as it
 
02:32:58.990 --> 02:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
exists essentially carves out an
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
exception from that and it says not
 
02:33:03.309 --> 02:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
withstanding normal principles of
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
limitations of
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
liability when a business collects meals
 
02:33:14.269 --> 02:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax which are essentially owed
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
visitor they're in a fiduciary
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
relationship they're taking custody of
 
02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
funds properly due to the state and so
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to appear Pierce behind the
 
02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
veil of corporate uh liability and make
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
that person responsible for abusing the
 
02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
public trust okay given that this is a
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
exception from those normal principles
 
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
it should be relatively
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
narrow and interestingly in the sentence
 
02:33:52.269 --> 02:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and
 
02:33:56.190 --> 02:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
10 it is relatively narrow with respect
 
02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:57.710 align:start position:0%
10 it is relatively narrow with respect
to

02:33:57.710 --> 02:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
corporations and it's not totally clear
 
02:34:03.389 --> 02:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
but I take that to mean both C corpse
 
02:34:05.070 --> 02:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
and sub chapter
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
S so it says for the purpose of this
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
section operator in the case of
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
Corporations includes the president the
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
treasurer or other person in a
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of said corporation
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
that is excellent language it could be
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
maybe flushed out a bit more
 
02:34:27.389 --> 02:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
corporations does in fact include C
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
Corps and sub chapter
 
02:34:31.950 --> 02:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
S now what's a sub chapter S without
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
getting into it it's really just simply
 
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
a a it's a vehicle for allowing
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
incorporation with certain tax
 
02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
advantages namely pass through um tax
 
02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
liability well that's essentially where
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
llc's come into the law LL the whole
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
point of llc's was to have something
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
simpler than a C corporation or
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
pre-existing sub chapter S and so why
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
then do we in contrast have the current
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
law saying in the next sentence that in
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
the case of a limited liability company
 
02:35:13.750 --> 02:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
operator includes members and any other
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
person in a managerial capacity I think
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a imagine if being a
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
shareholder of a C corporation subjected
 
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
you to having a lean placed on your
 
02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
personal home because the guy uh in
 
02:35:31.830 --> 02:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
charge of the
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
corporation didn't remit the funds
 
02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
okay the LLC members the passive
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
investors need the same kind of
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
protection that a shareholder in a C
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
Corp has this bill gives it to them now
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
question um you you brought this up in
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing as well and I think it's a
 
02:35:58.750 --> 02:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate question but I don't think
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
actually that the bill is ambiguous on
 
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
this point you've made the distinction
 
02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
more or less I think between somebody
 
02:36:08.269 --> 02:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
who is operating for sake of
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
illustration the gas
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
station but is not himself a member of
 
02:36:16.349 --> 02:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
the LLC or therefore an owner in the
 
02:36:19.150 --> 02:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
business but you've got to read this
 
02:36:22.750 --> 02:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
word so it says person in a managerial
 
02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
capacity of the limited liability
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
company so it's not just somebody who's
 
02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
been hired to manage the gas station
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
which is one of a chain of 20 this
 
02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
specifically is limited to and referring
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
to somebody in a managerial capacity of
 
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
the corporate organization the LLC
 
02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
itself so I I think we we we Illustrated
 
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
in the hearing in questions and and
 
02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:51.190 align:start position:0%
in the hearing in questions and and
somewhat

02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
now that there are ambiguities in this
 
02:36:57.269 --> 02:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
field of law but they're not the fault
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill and this bill actually is a
 
02:37:02.349 --> 02:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction and we
 
02:37:05.309 --> 02:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't um hold it up just because the
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
clear represent
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
Al yes um I'm talking about people and I
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
I I in my area I think that it is is
 
02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
normal um that have multiple Li limited
 
02:37:29.469 --> 02:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
liability companies but they are the
 
02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
principal owner of all of them each of
 
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
them is legally
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
separate and as I understood llc's one
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
of the reasons for starting them was to
 
02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
have a legal separateness between
 
02:37:47.230 --> 02:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
several um
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
businesses so that if if you caused a
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
major oil spill in one of them they
 
02:37:57.269 --> 02:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't collect from your next gas
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
station because they were two separate
 
02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
llc's that's absolutely correct but I'm
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
not sure it in any way defeats the
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill the purpose of this
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill is to say who is it what specific
 
02:38:13.950 --> 02:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
individual is it that we can hold
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
personally reliable for the failure to
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
remit mes and Rental tax that was
 
02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
collected from a visitor or you know um
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
so you're correct but but in any given
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
case there is a specific business
 
02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
entity that has the obligation of
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
collecting and remitting the meals and
 
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
rooms tax and that's what this and you
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
believe that would be the owner of the
 
02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
LLC rather than the person in the LLC
 
02:38:46.510 --> 02:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
who is working for the LLC right when
 
02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
this when this says managerial capacity
 
02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
of the LLC that to me by definition
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
requires that to be the managing member
 
02:38:56.830 --> 02:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
not any old member and definitely not un
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
employee okay thank you I I'll just add
 
02:39:02.590 --> 02:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
that um each year when you file an
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
annual report with the state you have to
 
02:39:08.349 --> 02:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
specify who that managerial member is
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
was that your point well well let me go
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
to representative fellows I know she's
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
been waiting for so what I just wanted
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
to say is now that I've heard it
 
02:39:20.670 --> 02:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
explained like about three times thank
 
02:39:24.670 --> 02:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
you for doing that that um that I
 
02:39:27.309 --> 02:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
understand the concept of man linking
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
managerial to be a member so it was it
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
would be a member of the LLC that has
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
the managerial
 
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so I understand that I
 
02:39:43.269 --> 02:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
don't think this
 
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
language makes that clear maybe if if
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
that's what you're thinking that maybe
 
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
it has to be more explicit and say a
 
02:39:56.349 --> 02:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
member or
 
02:40:01.469 --> 02:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
members that are have managerial members
 
02:40:03.630 --> 02:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
who have managerial experience instead
 
02:40:07.269 --> 02:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
of saying pars with managerial I I think
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
you're asking a very legitimate question
 
02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
and if I was drafting this with you I
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
think we would have chosen different
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
language but bear in mind that the
 
02:40:17.309 --> 02:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
problem that you're describing is
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
largely in the current law and not
 
02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
introduced by this bill right so I wrote
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
in my notes during the hearing you know
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better to Define operator
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
manager managerial capacity sure it
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
would be a clearer statute if we did
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
that but I think by definition the
 
02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
person in a managerial capacity of the
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
limited liability company can only be a
 
02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
member so it is bottom line the same
 
02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:51.630 align:start position:0%
member so it is bottom line the same
outcome

02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
do you have a followup yes I just I just
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
would ask if we want to pass this bill
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
that we fix that just fix that wording I
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
I think your concern was you'd you if
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's fixed it needs to be fixed in a in
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
a different I'm suggesting it's not
 
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to fix it I'm also suggesting
 
02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
that the problem you're pointing to is
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the existing statute not in the
 
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.950 align:start position:0%
in the existing statute not in the
bill

02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
represent yeah that that goes to to my
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
point as well because if you take a look
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
at the LLC many of us have llc's if you
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
take a look at the LLC statute some of
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
the terms are defined in that this
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
section is going to go
 
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
into uh the LLC section so those
 
02:41:39.070 --> 02:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
definitions that are already in law
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
exist now could the LLC statute be more
 
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
clear yes but does this say in the
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
phraseology that was just quoted by uh
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
um does it
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
say what we wanted to say and it says a
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
manager of the
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
LLC not the manager of the business
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
being run it's not the shift manager
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's the manager of the LLC which is a
 
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.030 align:start position:0%
it's the manager of the LLC which is a
distinct

02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
person uh representative
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you just a reminder the
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
manager is listed on the form that you
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
have to file and that can't be the gas
 
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
station daily person or any of that and
 
02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
it and it can be a member manager um the
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
form allows for a member manager or a
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
manager on the state form that's filed
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
annually representative Ames I just
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
think that we've got Dr in the room Dean
 
02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
Keen Wong is here and I'd like to hear
 
02:42:47.469 --> 02:42:47.479 align:start position:0%
his his uh he may have other
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
observations but I'd like to hear from
 
02:42:54.389 --> 02:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
him regarding this language and how
 
02:42:58.110 --> 02:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh it would work for the Dr or not work
 
02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
so well or how they might uh fill out uh
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
some ambiguities just through Ru
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
making okay yeah Mak sense U Mr
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
Wong yeah uh I concur with
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ames but I just want to
 
02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
throw one more thought in beforehand so
 
02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
that Keem can react to it but
 
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
I think that in line
 
02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
11 where this deletes members
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
and and then deletes other it actually
 
02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
makes the point clearer the existing
 
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
statute is
 
02:43:38.429 --> 02:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
saying includes
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
members and other persons well if you're
 
02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
not a member what what kind of an other
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
non you know right but removing these
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
three words makes it more clear that
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about only the member or
 
02:43:55.469 --> 02:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
members who are in a managerial
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
capacity so I think it actually improves
 
02:43:59.790 --> 02:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
on the current law in that respect as
 
02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you um please introduce
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
yourselves good afternoon my name is
 
02:44:07.230 --> 02:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
Keen Mong text policy council with the
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
02:44:11.630 --> 02:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue and I'm Peter Ro I'm an attorney
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Revenue
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
Administration thank
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon thank you for uh for
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
taking the time for to here is um we've
 
02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
been following the conversation and I I
 
02:44:24.630 --> 02:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
think what uh just wanted to clarify
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
that the for
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
llc's the the managers the the the the
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
persons with the capacity to manage the
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
the LLC not necessarily would be limited
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
to just members there could be um
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
managers that the the members have hired
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
to manage the LLC so I believe that
 
02:44:46.269 --> 02:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
taking out the uh the language here um
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
includes members and uh so the the the
 
02:44:52.269 --> 02:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
language of members and other and other
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
so it this therefore operator in the
 
02:44:58.590 --> 02:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
case of uh of a limited liability
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
company includes persons in a manag
 
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
manager capacity would
 
02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
include members who are managing as well
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
as non-members who were hired to manage
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
the LLC that's how we we read the uh the
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
language of of the proposed uh Amendment
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
um and then to sort of assist in um in
 
02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
this we've try to draft some kind of
 
02:45:25.150 --> 02:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
language to Define um what a person in a
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
man manager capacity to be in an
 
02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
LLC um and I I'll just I I made some
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
drafts and I'll hand it out
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
great yeah I think from our perspective
 
02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that many
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
llc's don't have somebody who's a named
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
managing member they just have members
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's we have to sort of peel
 
02:45:53.710 --> 02:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
the onion a little bit and find out
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
who's actually running the business and
 
02:45:58.950 --> 02:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
as Keen just said it could be an
 
02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
employee who's in charge of paying the
 
02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
tax bill who is neglects to do that um
 
02:46:08.070 --> 02:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
but that employee may not have any
 
02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
itself a question Mr
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
chairman yes for the attorney thank you
 
02:46:26.349 --> 02:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
uh has there been a a problem for the Dr
 
02:46:26.359 --> 02:46:27.510 align:start position:0%
uh has there been a a problem for the Dr
in

02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:46:30.870 --> 02:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
collecting meals and room taxes from
 
02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:32.590 align:start position:0%
collecting meals and room taxes from
llc's

02:46:32.590 --> 02:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
llc's
 
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
state we we we often have trouble
 
02:46:41.070 --> 02:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
collecting meals and rentals taxes from
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
llc's um they tend to be very cash-based
 
02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
they often their assets aren't wor that
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
the actually the entity's assets itself
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
are not worth very much or they have um
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
leans on them from uh commercial lenders
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
employees um and then we find that they
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
fractionate the business um among
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
members and so we've had a couple of
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
instances where you have the brilliant
 
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
Chef running the restaurant and the he
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
brings in his brother-in-law his
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law's sister and you know
 
02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
various people to participate in the
 
02:47:25.990 --> 02:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
business and they all put money in they
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
often sign a an operating agreement
 
02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
which is a contract among them which
 
02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
gives the members uh certain rights to
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh have information and to control how
 
02:47:40.110 --> 02:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
the business is operated and they often
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
will sit back and count on the brilliant
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
Chef to run it and one thing that we've
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
seen is that brilliant chefs do not make
 
02:47:50.830 --> 02:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
terribly brilliant business people and
 
02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
so the BR we had one case where the the
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
brilliant Chef died and left things kind
 
02:47:59.309 --> 02:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
of in a state of disarray and the
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
members who had been letting the
 
02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
brilliant Chef run it and it was a
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
relatively successful restaurant they
 
02:48:08.190 --> 02:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
discovered hadn't paid meals and rentals
 
02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
taxes in four or five years and so it
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
was it was kind of a mess to untangle
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
who was going to be liable for those
 
02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.950 --> 02:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
I have a question so regardless of who
 
02:48:26.190 --> 02:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
is who's been hired to manage the
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
operation or pay the taxes um the M&amp;R
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
taxes isn't it required on the state
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
form uh renewing the corporate uh status
 
02:48:42.030 --> 02:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
to identify a member or a manager the me
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
if it's a member it's a member manager
 
02:48:46.030 --> 02:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that person therefore be
 
02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
the responsible party
 
02:48:53.230 --> 02:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
the the forms as I've seen them
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
um don't exact a great deal of
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
rigor and they they change members and
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
managers with some regularity without
 
02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily updating the forms that they
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
submit on an annual basis to the
 
02:49:12.030 --> 02:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
office on that form isn't there a if I'm
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly there's a spot
 
02:49:18.750 --> 02:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
where you have to identify who's the
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
manager whether it's a manager in name
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
manager yeah they don't they don't list
 
02:49:33.309 --> 02:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
everybody they only have to list one
 
02:49:34.750 --> 02:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
person and I don't know that they need
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
to identify that person as a
 
02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:39.469 align:start position:0%
to identify that person as a
manager

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
manager
 
02:49:41.790 --> 02:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
02:49:44.269 --> 02:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
Ames I'm sorry I've looked at a lot of
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
them and I'm just kind of got a sort of
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
swirling in my head what they what they
 
02:49:48.429 --> 02:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
look like and I wish I had the form in
 
02:49:52.750 --> 02:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
front me but I don't I'm sorry yeah um I
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
looked at this that you just handed out
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for doing
 
02:50:01.229 --> 02:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
it I think that this is what we need to
 
02:50:04.830 --> 02:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
have that my my view uh the managerial
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
capacity is has filled with the those
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
two words alone are filled with
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
ambiguity this uh fleshes
 
02:50:20.190 --> 02:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
out the meaning of the con ccept without
 
02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
trying to boil it down to a single word
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
there are various characteristics that
 
02:50:29.269 --> 02:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
you look at um and um and the department
 
02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
makes a judgment based on those various
 
02:50:33.630 --> 02:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
facts and
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances um it's the right way to
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
go so I would encourage uh moving to get
 
02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill before we go
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
forward that uh would go down this alley
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and uh there are others here who are
 
02:50:50.229 --> 02:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
more familiar with llc's and this kind
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
of business than I am so I welcome uh
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
being told that's not the best way to
 
02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
go representative spillsbury
 
02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
um you know within the time and the
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
constraint of the committee I I I think
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ames suggestion is
 
02:51:10.229 --> 02:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
constructive I think that coming to us
 
02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
with this draft is helpful this goes
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
back to what I said when I was listening
 
02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
in the hearing I made a note to myself
 
02:51:19.269 --> 02:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
it would be best if we Define operator
 
02:51:21.870 --> 02:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
manager and managerial capacity so they
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
are inherently fuzzy um and I think that
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
the notion of determining who is an
 
02:51:29.990 --> 02:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
operator for the purposes of this
 
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
statute through a consideration of a
 
02:51:36.229 --> 02:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
range of facts is a good approach as
 
02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know one specific litmus
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
test it's kind of like how you determine
 
02:51:45.550 --> 02:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
doicle or something like that um but
 
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more words here than there in
 
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
the statute we're amending and we're
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
only amending it by taking out three
 
02:51:58.229 --> 02:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
words so is it your intention that this
 
02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
this is a way of determining the
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
operator of an LLC only for the purpose
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
of this one statute or is this an
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
approach you're thinking is a way to
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
determine who is responsible for an
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
llc's activity throughout corporate law
 
02:52:15.790 --> 02:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
as regulated by the state of New
 
02:52:18.750 --> 02:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in many statutes thank you
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I think our
 
02:52:22.030 --> 02:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
intention is that this would apply to
 
02:52:24.229 --> 02:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
this unique circumstances as you pointed
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
out where this is the exception to the
 
02:52:30.349 --> 02:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh Norm of uh limited liability and
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
protection from liability of of a
 
02:52:36.349 --> 02:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
corporate statute um we derived these uh
 
02:52:41.309 --> 02:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
factors from case law that um involves
 
02:52:43.070 --> 02:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh the Internal Revenue Service and how
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
it determines whether a person has
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
personal liability for payroll taxes for
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
example and so the the case law has has
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
come up with this seven Factor formula
 
02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.710 --> 02:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
factors um thank you representative Ames
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
did you still did you have a follow-up
 
02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
did you still did you have a follow-up
representative

02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
Ames um my colleague was uh bending my
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
ear so do you have a followup I'll
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
follow up to representative spillsbury
 
02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative PL is it
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
your contention then that the bill would
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
be Sol uh would be fortified by putting
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
this language in in
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
it or is that something you can do by
 
02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:31.150 align:start position:0%
it or is that something you can do by
rule

02:53:31.150 --> 02:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:34.990 align:start position:0%
rule
making

02:53:34.990 --> 02:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
no I'll I'll let the I'll let Keen
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
answer that one um I I think it it would
 
02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
be good to have some kind of guidance
 
02:53:45.870 --> 02:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
within the statute and then if we do
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
have um if there's more ambiguity we we
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
can sort of try to clear that up in in
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:53:57.229 --> 02:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and then because the the there are
 
02:53:59.630 --> 02:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
instances where um potentially we could
 
02:54:03.630 --> 02:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
say Okay um what's what's where are the
 
02:54:06.510 --> 02:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
OS or or jail C might say okay where is
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
your guidance in terms of where's your
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
limitation in terms of defining manager
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
capacity so with with statutory um
 
02:54:15.870 --> 02:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
language and statutory guidance then we
 
02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
can if if there is a need to we can
 
02:54:20.670 --> 02:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
expand for fur or Define further certain
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of the followup Mr chair follow
 
02:54:24.630 --> 02:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
up in the case of the brilliant Chef
 
02:54:27.469 --> 02:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
up he does that good one
 
02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative we'll go this way
 
02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
represent Aly yes um but I was under the
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
impression that um a number of smaller
 
02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
llc's even if they're owned by the same
 
02:54:49.110 --> 02:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
person on doesn't
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
is don't doesn't have officers or or a
 
02:54:56.429 --> 02:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
board so this this would be a pick and
 
02:54:58.469 --> 02:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
choose what applies in this
 
02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
case or it would be in everything um
 
02:55:04.229 --> 02:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct representative uh not
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
all llc's would have a board of
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
directors um and and not all llc's would
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
have would hire a specific manager to
 
02:55:15.469 --> 02:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
manage the llc's it could be managed by
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
the the the uh the manager themselves
 
02:55:21.429 --> 02:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's very it's a bit
 
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
challenging to have a specific as as
 
02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury said a
 
02:55:28.910 --> 02:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
specific limus test to Define okay what
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
is who is this manager capacity and
 
02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's why the the reason for
 
02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:34.550 align:start position:0%
that's that's why the the reason for
this

02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
listing and and these factors aren't
 
02:55:39.870 --> 02:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be you need to check all the
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
boxes it could be that one factor could
 
02:55:44.830 --> 02:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
be dispositive and all the other factors
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't apply or it could be you know
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
three of them work and not the other
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
four all right next is representative
 
02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
ER yes that that follows through the
 
02:55:59.670 --> 02:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
only comment that there it's one comment
 
02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
in a couple of different places you're
 
02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
using the term managerial capacity and
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
yet in the LLC law a manager is a
 
02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
specific individual but you're not
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
talking about that kind of man um member
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
manager you're talking about a
 
02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:19.110 align:start position:0%
manager you're talking about a
supervisor

02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
supervisor
or

02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:56:23.269 --> 02:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
supervisory capacity and if you go down
 
02:56:25.150 --> 02:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
through your laundry
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
list that's all supervisory activity not
 
02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:31.790 align:start position:0%
list that's all supervisory activity not
necessarily

02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:33.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily
LLC

02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
LLC
 
02:56:38.190 --> 02:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
participation capacity that a member
 
02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
would be a member of that is an
 
02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
investment member which we're trying to
 
02:56:45.070 --> 02:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
do is protect the investment members
 
02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
from the manager from the supervisory
 
02:56:50.429 --> 02:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
members the members engaged in a I'm
 
02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
trying to dis distinguish between
 
02:57:00.910 --> 02:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
capital M member LLC and and man small M
 
02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
manager doing the job so it's a
 
02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:05.150 align:start position:0%
manager doing the job so it's a
supervisory

02:57:05.150 --> 02:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
supervisory
 
02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
individual um and your language uh
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
including but not limited
 
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
to seems to cover everything in there
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
does supervisory meet your definition of
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:28.349 --> 02:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
for defrauding the
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
state thank you for that question I
 
02:57:33.150 --> 02:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
think the answer is
 
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
the these factors would in would include
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
people who don't have U an equity stake
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
in the business so it could include the
 
02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
person who's hired as a manager um and
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
is resp responsible for making the U
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
sequestration and and remittance of the
 
02:57:57.710 --> 02:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh taxes that were collected for the
 
02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
state but failed to do so so it it it's
 
02:58:03.389 --> 02:58:03.399 align:start position:0%
it's broader than simply getting into
 
02:58:06.590 --> 02:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of an LLC but it and and
 
02:58:08.590 --> 02:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
and this is and gets into the sort of
 
02:58:10.830 --> 02:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
the overall operation of the business
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
and this is how we've always interpreted
 
02:58:14.710 --> 02:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
it although you know I think I would say
 
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
that you know we're we're not just
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
despite being the Department of Revenue
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're not unreasonable people and you
 
02:58:23.710 --> 02:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
know if you said yeah there's a
 
02:58:26.110 --> 02:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
19-year-old manager who hires and fires
 
02:58:29.269 --> 02:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
people and and works at night you know
 
02:58:31.469 --> 02:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to make him liable no I
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't think so um you know we would look
 
02:58:36.429 --> 02:58:36.439 align:start position:0%
at at sort of the whole picture and
 
02:58:38.349 --> 02:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
decide has this person have enough
 
02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility that it's sort of fair
 
02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
and reasonable to make them liable for
 
02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
the unpaid uh meals and rentals taxes
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
follow up so let me just follow up if so
 
02:58:51.830 --> 02:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
if that person if in trying to make that
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
determination if the person you think is
 
02:58:58.150 --> 02:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible is a member and
 
02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
and let's say this passes and that
 
02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
person's a
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
member you could deem them a member
 
02:59:09.309 --> 02:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
manager and therefore hold them
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
accountable I I think that's correct if
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
if a person was a a member but also had
 
02:59:16.429 --> 02:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in operating the
 
02:59:19.349 --> 02:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
business or had the opportunity to have
 
02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
those responsibilities but chooses
 
02:59:24.190 --> 02:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
basically puts their head in the sand um
 
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
we could then treat that person as
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
personally as an operator for purposes
 
02:59:31.950 --> 02:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
of this liability okay thank you
 
02:59:36.910 --> 02:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:40.229 --> 02:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
ring I am not sure but it seems as
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
though we're pretty much deep into the
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
woods that there needs to be more work
 
02:59:45.510 --> 02:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
on this and I think you can well it
 
02:59:47.030 --> 02:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
seems to me we might have just come full
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
circle and and by and by passing this is
 
02:59:52.830 --> 02:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
not a problem because they can still
 
02:59:55.870 --> 02:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
determine who is the
 
02:59:58.510 --> 02:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
managerial uh who has managerial
 
03:00:00.910 --> 03:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility and therefore is
 
03:00:03.550 --> 03:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
accountable I realize we cannot bind a
 
03:00:07.630 --> 03:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
future legislature we really uh the
 
03:00:10.150 --> 03:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislature capital L needs to take a
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
look at these rules there's no reference
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
in this particular Bill to the meaning
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the terms um member and member
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
manager and all that type of stuff that
 
03:00:25.269 --> 03:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
exists within the LLC law and making a
 
03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
connection to this law and the follow-up
 
03:00:30.590 --> 03:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
question on that was what do you do when
 
03:00:32.670 --> 03:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
it was done deliberately is that a
 
03:00:34.590 --> 03:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
criminal action or just is there only
 
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
civil penalties
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
available no it's definitely a crime um
 
03:00:44.830 --> 03:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
our rules provide that um the funds that
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
are collected from the customers are
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
held in trust for the state and if they
 
03:00:55.150 --> 03:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
are taken from that trust that's an act
 
03:00:56.990 --> 03:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
of conversion which is essentially a
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
theft and then in our our criminal code
 
03:01:03.550 --> 03:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
you know the the RSA 21
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
j39 uh if I'm not mistaken we I think
 
03:01:08.429 --> 03:01:08.439 align:start position:0%
there's a a provision in there for
 
03:01:10.750 --> 03:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who does steal money from the
 
03:01:12.990 --> 03:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
state and we've had you know I think we
 
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
gave you an example of one but we've had
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
a a number of successful Criminal
 
03:01:19.389 --> 03:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
prosecutions of people who take the
 
03:01:22.269 --> 03:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
money from the customers and uh find
 
03:01:23.950 --> 03:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
ways to intentionally use it to their
 
03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:25.229 align:start position:0%
ways to intentionally use it to their
own

03:01:25.229 --> 03:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
benefit representative fellows thank you
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what you I'm
 
03:01:33.950 --> 03:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is being treated
 
03:01:37.070 --> 03:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
differently than some similar situations
 
03:01:40.710 --> 03:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
so what if this business hadn't paid its
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
bet tax would they how would you
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
determine who to go after and if you I
 
03:01:49.469 --> 03:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
realize you the attorney for Dr but what
 
03:01:52.190 --> 03:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
if they don't pay the electric bill or
 
03:01:54.429 --> 03:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
some other you know
 
03:01:54.439 --> 03:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
some other you know
supplier

03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
03:02:00.630 --> 03:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
so we're dealing with a tax here that is
 
03:02:04.190 --> 03:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
has been called a trust fund tax so this
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
is a tax on the customer and the and the
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
the operator that whether it's a hotel
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
or a restaurant their their duty is is a
 
03:02:14.670 --> 03:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to collect that tax and
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
give it to us because they're just
 
03:02:20.670 --> 03:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
really kind of a p through bet and the
 
03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
other income taxes are a tax on the oper
 
03:02:24.910 --> 03:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
or the owner's income so you could have
 
03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
an LLC running a successful restaurant
 
03:02:30.349 --> 03:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
owe both M&amp;R the meals and rentals tax
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
and owe business
 
03:02:34.990 --> 03:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
taxes for us to get personal liability
 
03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
against a restaurant or business owner
 
03:02:40.229 --> 03:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
any business owner for the income taxes
 
03:02:42.030 --> 03:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
is a more difficult and complicated
 
03:02:44.349 --> 03:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
exercise we have to either pierce the
 
03:02:46.670 --> 03:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
corporate veil which is complicated or
 
03:02:49.710 --> 03:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
prove that there was a sham transaction
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
or that the uh owner was a
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
transferee of the business assets at a
 
03:02:58.750 --> 03:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
time when the business was essentially
 
03:03:01.990 --> 03:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
insolvent so there are specific there's
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
a specific statute for a couple of those
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
things and the um the uh Alter Ego you
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
know pissing the veil is a sort of a
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
common law theory with some basis and
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
statute but you know that's how we go
 
03:03:18.269 --> 03:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
after you know and it's a very unusual
 
03:03:21.429 --> 03:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
set of circumstances an individual who
 
03:03:24.630 --> 03:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
um has failed to pay income taxes in a
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
way that um you know we we find personal
 
03:03:34.309 --> 03:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
liability ask bet I asked bet
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
specifically because I didn't want to
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
get into that let me let me answer that
 
03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the sense that I think what what the
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
point here is the money collected the
 
03:03:45.429 --> 03:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
tax collected on
 
03:03:48.990 --> 03:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R the customer paid that that's that's
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's not the business doesn't have any
 
03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh needs to pass that on to the state
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
when it's your when it's business income
 
03:03:57.279 --> 03:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
when it's your when it's business income
the

03:03:57.990 --> 03:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:00.910 --> 03:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
business uh they're paying taxes on
 
03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
their own business income so it's a
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
totally different um scenario I think
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's what you're so that's why that's
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
why I didn't ask about income I asked
 
03:04:13.710 --> 03:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
about the be tax which is on you know a
 
03:04:15.030 --> 03:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of the
 
03:04:18.790 --> 03:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
employees wages right and and and also
 
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
like a supplier well the
 
03:04:27.070 --> 03:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
bet is is a is an Enterprise Value tax
 
03:04:29.550 --> 03:04:29.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that we measure that
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
is on payroll but it's not actually a
 
03:04:35.389 --> 03:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
payroll tax it's just a the the the
 
03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
payroll is a a convenient metric for
 
03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
determining what the Enterprise Value is
 
03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
I think I got that right thank you I'm a
 
03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
little out of my league here but I'm
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that we treat it more like
 
03:04:50.110 --> 03:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
the income tax as a tax on the business
 
03:04:55.910 --> 03:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:58.590 --> 03:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
customers uh representative ORS thank
 
03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
question so all this conversation sounds
 
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
to me like it's it's on the back end I
 
03:05:08.229 --> 03:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
think the real solution is to put the
 
03:05:12.030 --> 03:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the front end and companies
 
03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
like a restaurant let's say Olive Garden
 
03:05:15.309 --> 03:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
or somebody if they're collecting meals
 
03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax they should be forced
 
03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
monthly or quarterly to submit a
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
documentation and a check right now that
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like it's happening so we
 
03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
wait till after the fact and and if uh
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
we got suers Chef that Waits four years
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know and he's doing his thing or
 
03:05:35.309 --> 03:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
she's doing her thing and they're
 
03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
pocketing the money that's what it
 
03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's no mechanism to trip
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
that where if you put the emphasis on
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to force them to submit
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
accordly that's it sounds to me like
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's the answer we just you know let's
 
03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
get right to the meat of it here um I we
 
03:05:55.910 --> 03:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
do actually require every business to
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
obtain a license from us and that tells
 
03:06:01.309 --> 03:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
us that there's some there's an operator
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
and it often identifies who the operator
 
03:06:06.190 --> 03:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
people are and then we require them to
 
03:06:09.229 --> 03:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
file a monthly return which tells us how
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
much they took in in tax and how much
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
they they're turning over to us and then
 
03:06:16.830 --> 03:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
we have a you know a a web-based portal
 
03:06:18.429 --> 03:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
that they can file return and make the
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
payment through um we have you know a
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
collections department that monitors the
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
best they can the businesses that we
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
know about and then sometimes businesses
 
03:06:31.469 --> 03:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
fly under the radar like like you know
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
the brilliant Chef I mentioned um and
 
03:06:36.990 --> 03:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you we do the best we can just
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
just quick followup I just want to so
 
03:06:40.790 --> 03:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
you do have somebody monitoring
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring these these businesses
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
because it sounded to me like initially
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
you were saying and I'm I'm thinking gee
 
03:06:49.389 --> 03:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
just need somebody then to look at it
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
but I I guess I'm not sure why how does
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
it fall I'm going to interrupt you
 
03:06:57.070 --> 03:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative or I don't think that's
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand okay um the
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh the issue here is members versus
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
managers and
 
03:07:07.710 --> 03:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
collectibility of of that should should
 
03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
they not be paying uh so I'm going to go
 
03:07:12.630 --> 03:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
to representative spillsbury who had his
 
03:07:15.389 --> 03:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
light on for a little while thank you Mr
 
03:07:20.910 --> 03:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um I believe we have I have in
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
fact come full
 
03:07:25.389 --> 03:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
circle and I'm going to suggest as you
 
03:07:28.110 --> 03:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
said suggested a couple minutes
 
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
ago this is a classic instance where we
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
should rely on the agency to do the rule
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
making the phrase operator in a m
 
03:07:40.870 --> 03:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of the limited
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
liability Corporation is sufficient for
 
03:07:43.479 --> 03:07:45.150 align:start position:0%
liability Corporation is sufficient for
statutory

03:07:45.150 --> 03:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:07:48.229 --> 03:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
purposes in fact amend the bill to
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
include something that is a seven Factor
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
sliding scale of which some could be and
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
some aren't is that's inherently too
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
fuzzy for legislation and I I'm backing
 
03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
away from it myself I would like us to
 
03:08:03.790 --> 03:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
pass the bill as it was sent to us by
 
03:08:06.510 --> 03:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
the senate i I'd like to just clarify
 
03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
two things that have come
 
03:08:11.550 --> 03:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
up the analogy that I used
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Fells in the hearing was
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
to the federal income tax employee
 
03:08:16.920 --> 03:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
to the federal income tax employee
withholding

03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
withholding
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's a situation which is really more
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
parallel to this where the
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has their funds sequestered and
 
03:08:30.510 --> 03:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
held by in trust right so in in this
 
03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
case the taxpayer is the person who buys
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
the meal or buys the
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
room um we should also therefore in that
 
03:08:42.910 --> 03:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
context remember that this is just one
 
03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
hook on enforcing that obligation there
 
03:08:48.269 --> 03:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
is Criminal
 
03:08:51.229 --> 03:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
liability um in
 
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
my um in the portion of my career in
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
which I was focused on business
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
restructure and uh and workout refinance
 
03:09:03.309 --> 03:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
it was very common to come in and find
 
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
that the company that was struggling to
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
survive was also in a rears on their
 
03:09:11.790 --> 03:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
Federal um employee tax
 
03:09:14.469 --> 03:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
withholding and so the very first thing
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
we put the the focus on in those
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
engagements was to resolve the federal
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
tax problem because the consequences are
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
severe right there is a difference
 
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
between something which is overtly fraud
 
03:09:30.750 --> 03:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
essentially theft from the business
 
03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
theft of those trust funds for your own
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
personal purposes it can get much more
 
03:09:37.389 --> 03:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
ambiguous than that because often it's
 
03:09:39.030 --> 03:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
just simply a business that is
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
struggling to stay alive and they've got
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
a check uh balance they've got an a
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
balance in their checking account and
 
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
they've got a checkbook and they just
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
start writing checks in the order in
 
03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
which they think is necessary to survive
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that check to the Dr didn't come up
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the top priority there's there's less
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
animous less Criminal Intent in that
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
respect so this is such a confusing area
 
03:10:08.190 --> 03:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
this bill relates exclusively to one
 
03:10:11.070 --> 03:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
remedy can we pierce the corporate veil
 
03:10:13.750 --> 03:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
and put a lean on your home I think we
 
03:10:16.309 --> 03:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
need to pass the bill and let the Dr
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
sort out how to interpret those
 
03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:21.150 align:start position:0%
sort out how to interpret those
particular

03:10:21.150 --> 03:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
terms thank you um okay I think we're
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
almost ready to move on take a couple
 
03:10:28.349 --> 03:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
more questions or statements
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yes on and this is
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
just something that is not on here but
 
03:10:39.309 --> 03:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned which is um that you
 
03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
would go after a member who had chosen
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
not to pay attention to the running of
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
the business
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
business if you if you couldn't get
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
anything out of the manager I guess um
 
03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that end up with the same
 
03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
situation that is they are trying to
 
03:11:08.429 --> 03:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
avoid that um the rest of the members of
 
03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the LLC would be
 
03:11:14.590 --> 03:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
liable because didn't they all choose
 
03:11:18.510 --> 03:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
if if I understand the question I I
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
think the answer
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
is under the as as I mentioned many of
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
these organizations have an operating
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and it's a contract between
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
the members that establishes what their
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
rights are with respect to the operation
 
03:11:38.150 --> 03:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
of the business and those operating
 
03:11:39.229 --> 03:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
Agreements are
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
not lodged at the secretary estate's
 
03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
office and their private agreements and
 
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes the members have them
 
03:11:47.389 --> 03:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't but those operating
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
agreements describe in them what rights
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
a given member has with respect to
 
03:11:55.590 --> 03:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
running the business and they often give
 
03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
them rights to to have information
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
provided to them so that they can see
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
that the accounts are being paid
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
properly and they have rights to um
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
request an accounting and they have
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
rights to change the management of the
 
03:12:13.950 --> 03:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
business and so I think the point that I
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
was making is if if a member has those
 
03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
was making is if if a member has those
rights

03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
but puts her head in the sand and
 
03:12:22.229 --> 03:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
decides not to worry about the business
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
because they're collecting their their
 
03:12:25.950 --> 03:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
their their share of the profits from
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
the business all everything seems to be
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
going well but in fact the actual
 
03:12:34.750 --> 03:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
manager is is neglecting paying the
 
03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
Dr then we think it's fair to say you
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
know you you you owed them bit more
 
03:12:44.429 --> 03:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
diligence to this problem and that you
 
03:12:47.550 --> 03:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
can't claim ignorance when that you
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
essentially engaged in willful
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
blindness it sounds to me like it's
 
03:12:55.950 --> 03:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
effectively the difference
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
between a silent partner who invested
 
03:13:01.990 --> 03:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
but isn't really involved but you but
 
03:13:04.269 --> 03:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
you at at the Dr have determined okay
 
03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
this person isn't really a silent
 
03:13:08.830 --> 03:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
partner member this is actually someone
 
03:13:12.190 --> 03:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
who's been involved with decisionmaking
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
or managerial capacity than they are
 
03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:18.070 align:start position:0%
or managerial capacity than they are
liable

03:13:18.070 --> 03:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
liable
 
03:13:21.790 --> 03:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative fellows yes
 
03:13:27.190 --> 03:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
why don't we consider having the The
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
Entity that has needs to pay room and
 
03:13:34.030 --> 03:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
meals tax um give you give
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
Dr um some a form that says who the
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
specific name of the person that is
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for the payment
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
of the this tax and then there would be
 
03:13:51.550 --> 03:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of and tell them that they
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
have to um update it whenever that
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
changes and maybe make a penalty if they
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
don't keep you
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
know maybe no penalty but I don't want
 
03:14:05.550 --> 03:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
them to get get away with like putting a
 
03:14:07.469 --> 03:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
name on there and the person's like long
 
03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
gone and it still sits there maybe make
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
it updated
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
frequently we actually do that um the
 
03:14:19.389 --> 03:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
the the license application form
 
03:14:21.870 --> 03:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
requires them to list who their you know
 
03:14:25.229 --> 03:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
officers and who's managing that kind of
 
03:14:25.239 --> 03:14:27.150 align:start position:0%
officers and who's managing that kind of
information

03:14:27.150 --> 03:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:14:31.389 --> 03:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
um when we're looking down the list at
 
03:14:33.229 --> 03:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
members that perhaps we didn't know
 
03:14:33.239 --> 03:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
members that perhaps we didn't know
about

03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's usually because the people at the
 
03:14:42.870 --> 03:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
top of the list are gone or are bankrupt
 
03:14:45.910 --> 03:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
or otherwise insolvent and don't have
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
the money to pay so we we kind of start
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
with what's on our application for who's
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
who's who's a who's who's really running
 
03:14:56.190 --> 03:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
this business and then we find oh yeah
 
03:14:58.269 --> 03:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's the brilliant Chef he's dead so
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
now let's go see who else there is and
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of the the analysis
 
03:15:04.670 --> 03:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
we do because you know we don't like to
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
work harder than we have to you know we
 
03:15:09.389 --> 03:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
want to work smarter not harder and so
 
03:15:11.950 --> 03:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
you know we start with the more obvious
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and logical targets and when those
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
are when we're unsuccessful there then
 
03:15:17.790 --> 03:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
we move down the
 
03:15:20.189 --> 03:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
list thank you I'm going to end the work
 
03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.189 --> 03:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
585 okay I'm going to open the work
 
03:15:29.830 --> 03:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
546 removing the requirement that an ex
 
03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:42.670 --> 03:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
conveyed is that right oh removing I'm
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
sorry removing the executory interest
 
03:15:48.750 --> 03:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
okay um com
 
03:15:52.830 --> 03:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.189 --> 03:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
thoroughly we covered it thoroughly and
 
03:15:58.710 --> 03:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
um okay representative spillsbury
 
03:16:08.670 --> 03:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I happen to be uh
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
another one of el Chip's fan fans uh
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are two projects in recent years
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
in my hometown Charleston town that have
 
03:16:20.910 --> 03:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh been done with elep funds restoration
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
of our town hall and of our library both
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
historic 19th century structures and I'm
 
03:16:27.870 --> 03:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
convinced it would not have occurred
 
03:16:30.910 --> 03:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
without their assistance uh having said
 
03:16:34.510 --> 03:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
that that's a a plug um I think that
 
03:16:36.750 --> 03:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
this is uh an absolutely simple
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill it's clear that
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
they don't need the executory interest
 
03:16:46.710 --> 03:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh to pass uh to the state the state and
 
03:16:49.110 --> 03:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the AG have opined that there's an
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
adequate set of Protections in the trust
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
relationship and I don't think the bill
 
03:16:57.389 --> 03:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
uh really raises any kinds of questions
 
03:16:58.670 --> 03:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm all for
 
03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you let me um let me just
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
kind of ask the committee a question um
 
03:17:06.910 --> 03:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
I I had raised a question on line five
 
03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
um where the word acquire was crossed
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
out and um change to provide uh funding
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
for the acquisition um so how do people
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
feel like about that represent me I just
 
03:17:23.229 --> 03:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a comment I was in on the
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of LP okay and on uh some of
 
03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
the private discussions Before the bill
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
went in and um it makes perfect sense
 
03:17:38.429 --> 03:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
that at first um they were thinking
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
about the program requiring the the uh
 
03:17:48.429 --> 03:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
properties themselves but they soon in
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
in uh trying to use this model realized
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
it was going to take a great deal of uh
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
administrative capacity from in elip
 
03:18:04.590 --> 03:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
that that was going to be
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
increasingly uh making it impossible for
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
them to do much except uh administer
 
03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
pass grants and uh there was an LP
 
03:18:20.550 --> 03:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
before that 20 30 years before that on
 
03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
which um I think may have run into that
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
problem because it was originally fed
 
03:18:26.040 --> 03:18:27.550 align:start position:0%
problem because it was originally fed
federally

03:18:27.550 --> 03:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
federally
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
funded and um so they changed that but
 
03:18:35.710 --> 03:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
as she said they forgot to change this
 
03:18:40.110 --> 03:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
sentence um so that what is happening
 
03:18:44.590 --> 03:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
now which My Town also has profited from
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
twice I think uh
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
except that you have to be sure that El
 
03:18:53.070 --> 03:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
Chip is going to be able to give you the
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
money and they frequently can't and so
 
03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
you've made an agreement with somebody
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay the whole thing and
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
we've run into that a few times but on I
 
03:19:06.990 --> 03:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
think that that part of it makes perfect
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
sense okay the whole thing makes perfect
 
03:19:11.309 --> 03:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
sense all right thank you represented
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes so I originally had some
 
03:19:13.920 --> 03:19:15.070 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes so I originally had some
concerns

03:19:15.070 --> 03:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:19:18.830 --> 03:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
about you know decades down the line the
 
03:19:23.070 --> 03:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
use of uh property that that was part of
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
this program turned into something it
 
03:19:28.990 --> 03:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't supposed to be but I I'm guessing
 
03:19:31.110 --> 03:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
now that if you look at
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
lines 16 through
 
03:19:34.439 --> 03:19:36.030 align:start position:0%
lines 16 through
18

03:19:36.030 --> 03:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
18
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
that you know maybe maybe one of the
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
lawyers could explain it to me but I'm
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
hoping that that part would allow the
 
03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
state to have
 
03:19:49.389 --> 03:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
information and keep information about
 
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
what the property is supposed to be used
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
for and will somehow I'm not sure how
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
they find out when it's been sold but
 
03:20:02.469 --> 03:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
but somehow know if there are proposed
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
if things are about to happen that
 
03:20:05.120 --> 03:20:07.349 align:start position:0%
if things are about to happen that
shouldn't

03:20:07.349 --> 03:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
03:20:07.359 --> 03:20:08.950 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
happen

03:20:08.950 --> 03:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
so representative spills it just happens
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm preparing to acquire a piece of
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
land that is in fact subject to a coner
 
03:20:19.750 --> 03:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
a easement and it's all recorded uh it's
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
a legal document it's just as enforcable
 
03:20:25.189 --> 03:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
as if the uh Power Company had obtained
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
an easement to put power lines down the
 
03:20:31.590 --> 03:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
edge of your property um so I think no
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
you can rest
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
easy representative Ames yeah I think
 
03:20:40.950 --> 03:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
that bill is a a good bill it's a a
 
03:20:44.590 --> 03:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
simple cleanup uh clarification and uh
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
we should just go ahead with it all
 
03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
right it's essentially what everybody's
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
been saying thank you I'm going to close
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
now I get the next obviously the next
 
03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
step here we have is the um executive
 
03:21:06.520 --> 03:21:07.870 align:start position:0%
step here we have is the um executive
session

03:21:07.870 --> 03:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:21:12.189 --> 03:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
but um we probably should uh
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
Break um momentarily although I I'm
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
sensing kind of agreement on all five of
 
03:21:20.309 --> 03:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
these but I might be wrong I don't uh
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
a let me just take a take a break for a
 
03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:45.520 --> 03:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
things

03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:45.429 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%

03:31:50.750 --> 03:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
will not allow
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
for to go to consent on the time
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
comes okay representative duet yeah and
 
03:32:01.950 --> 03:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
I will be supporting the itl in that uh
 
03:32:04.590 --> 03:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
the argument was made under the
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
interstate horse racing act which states
 
03:32:10.950 --> 03:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
clearly in that piece of federal
 
03:32:12.910 --> 03:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that it has to comply with
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
the laws of the state where the bet is
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
being being made and the state in which
 
03:32:21.070 --> 03:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
the BET originates we have laws that
 
03:32:23.469 --> 03:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
dictate that and I believe those laws
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
are not being
 
03:32:28.750 --> 03:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
addressed as far as the rule that spells
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
out exactly what our laws are in New
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're not complying with
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
those rules right now and those laws in
 
03:32:36.640 --> 03:32:38.309 align:start position:0%
those rules right now and those laws in
my

03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
estimation representative fellows um yes
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say that I support
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
the itl because was the part about the
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
um what is it called
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
charity charitable thirdparty Financial
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
intermediary intermediary program um is
 
03:33:02.160 --> 03:33:03.349 align:start position:0%
intermediary intermediary program um is
not

03:33:03.349 --> 03:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:33:06.389 --> 03:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
feasible uh it makes it look like there
 
03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be some money available to go to
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities but we're it's pretty
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
$20,000 a year will will not be enough
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
for this to operate and that the fact
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
that current Charities
 
03:33:27.990 --> 03:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
receiving uh money for charitable G
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
gambling will take priority over the
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
town's getting any money and they they
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities are not going to get
 
03:33:37.189 --> 03:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
anything of any
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
significance represent
 
03:33:44.910 --> 03:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you on I also am not going to
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
support the itl but um primarily because
 
03:33:53.070 --> 03:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
I think that there are a lot of
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
different pieces of law that we have not
 
03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
really been able to see yet uh
 
03:34:01.510 --> 03:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative set told me that um the
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
one that he sent us is not the one he
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
should have sent us and it maybe it's
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
has to be somewhere else in the statute
 
03:34:09.239 --> 03:34:10.870 align:start position:0%
has to be somewhere else in the statute
on

03:34:10.870 --> 03:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
and and the question of uh
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
of what happens when the notwithstanding
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
Clause is put in for me is is an
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
opposite problem than it one is for some
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues I don't think that
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're at the stage yet where we should
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
be voting on it but um uh I don't want
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the Democratic side to
 
03:34:41.389 --> 03:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
follow my lead whichever you make up
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
your own
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:56.189 --> 03:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I I will be uh on the itl side
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think it uh it's basically a
 
03:35:05.790 --> 03:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
judgment that this uh has a number of
 
03:35:08.910 --> 03:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
incomplete pieces that I I wouldn't I'm
 
03:35:10.590 --> 03:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
not ready to support at this time and I
 
03:35:12.030 --> 03:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't think they're necessary to go
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%

these done as quickly after exac as
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
possible um put your microphone on
 
03:40:23.429 --> 03:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
please are we going to do 546 yes oh
 
03:40:23.439 --> 03:40:24.710 align:start position:0%
please are we going to do 546 yes oh
that's

03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
next okay I just wanted to say that 585
 
03:40:30.269 --> 03:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
we're not going to exec today and what
 
03:40:32.830 --> 03:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm planning I don't know the exact
 
03:40:35.950 --> 03:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
date yet but the next time we meet um
 
03:40:40.150 --> 03:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
which will not be next week um I also
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to check with Dr to see if when we
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
do this because this is this is it for
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
our bill and I don't want to come in
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
just for just for that one if we can
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
also get an update uh from Dr as to the
 
03:40:53.710 --> 03:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
revenue uh
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
projections um so we will exec sp sp 585
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
and do Revenue projections whatever that
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
day is it'll it could be two weeks from
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
today I just have to make sure that Dr
 
03:41:08.110 --> 03:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
would be ready for Revenue
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
projections discuss that I think they
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
they may be ready by the 14th but you
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
need to ask them yeah if they're not
 
03:41:19.630 --> 03:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
ready in two weeks um our our cut off
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
here is may we have to exec everything
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
by May 16th um and I'm trying to avoid
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
having everyone come in just to exec one
 
03:41:30.750 --> 03:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
bill um but if I can't piggyback Dr at
 
03:41:32.590 --> 03:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
the same time we may have to come in uh
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
and exec that one bill Mr chair what are
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the odds of us getting second committee
 
03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:41.110 align:start position:0%
the odds of us getting second committee
bills

03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know low I would say low
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean there's always a chance we'
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
get a second committee Bill and have to
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
time I do have a dam bill which is it
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
coming to ways and means it may uh it is
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
a second committee bill doesn't it
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't say I've been it up until which
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
committee is going to but I know the
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
last one went to you I'm trying to think
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
I I did go to a meeting where there were
 
03:42:17.149 --> 03:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
only three or four committees that had
 
03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
second committee bills coming and Ways
 
03:42:21.309 --> 03:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
and Means wasn't one of them but things
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
could always change but currently
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
currently there's no plan for a second
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay they haven't done that represent PL
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that your committee will
 
03:42:36.429 --> 03:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
strip out the financing part of it so it
 
03:42:37.990 --> 03:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to Ways and
 
03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:41.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to Ways and
Means

03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
well that's a yes we are definitely
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
considering that thank you okay so so
 
03:42:51.790 --> 03:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
that's the status on 585 we'll hold off
 
03:42:54.149 --> 03:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
and um next time we meet we'll exec that
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
one okay so representative Aly aren't we
 
03:43:01.590 --> 03:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
doing 546 yeah I'm GNA do that now but I
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to I'm just kind of going in
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
order I want people to know what's
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
happening with 585 okay so now open the
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
546 um would someone like to make a
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
motion on that representative spilsbury
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move OTP on SB
 
03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.429 --> 03:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
elme and would you like to speak to your
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
motion representative spillsbury yes I
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
think the bill proved non-controversial
 
03:43:41.110 --> 03:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it's mostly in the nature of a
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill to reconcile the
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
language in the statute to the
 
03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
Convention of providing funding for
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
acquisition rather than directly
 
03:43:55.710 --> 03:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
acquiring and uh also for the fact that
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh the state and the AG have determined
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
that the executory interest is not a
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
important element in protecting the
 
03:44:06.349 --> 03:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
interest of the state and that the trust
 
03:44:09.389 --> 03:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh relationship does that adequately so
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
easy bill for us to
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
pass any further
 
03:44:16.030 --> 03:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none the clerk will call
 
03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%

03:44:23.229 --> 03:44:23.239 align:start position:0%

okay and I'll close the exact session on
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
546 all right um very good we um made it
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
through that nicely um so again we just
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
have one bill left assuming we don't get
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
any second committee bills we are down
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
to one bill to exact s SP 585 and uh as
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
I said we will not meet next week so and
 
03:45:42.429 --> 03:45:42.439 align:start position:0%
I'll try to find out as as soon as
 
03:45:45.149 --> 03:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
possible what dr's situation is so that
 
03:45:47.550 --> 03:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
we will either meet two weeks from today
 
03:45:49.469 --> 03:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
or possibly three weeks from today but
 
03:45:52.189 --> 03:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
we'll be very close to our deadline of
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
May 16th of getting this out the only
 
03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
caveat there would be if suddenly we do
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
get a second committee Bill uh but um
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
but we are not meeting next week so
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
breaks my heart any any questions
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
um possibly I need I want to I as I said
 
03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
I don't want to come back just to exec
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
one bill I want to get Dr updates as
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
well so if Dr says we're not ready then
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
I'm it'll be after that but I hope to
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
find out in the next couple
 
03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
days what's
 
03:46:35.149 --> 03:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
that no no we at a minimum we're not
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
meeting until two weeks from today which
 
03:46:42.750 --> 03:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
