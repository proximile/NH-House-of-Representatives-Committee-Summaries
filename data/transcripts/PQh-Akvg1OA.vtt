and um
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
i have a few comments
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we distributed a few peeps pieces of
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
paper unfortunately we didn't get them i
 
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
didn't get them until last night
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
i wish we were sent them earlier so
 
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.350 align:start position:0%
i wish we were sent them earlier so
everybody

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
could have a chance to look at them
 
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
one of them is the oplc draft
 
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation from the director
 
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
legislation from the director
and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
another one is from
 
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
another one is from
uh

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
bob clegg's organization right there
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
is a good bill
 
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.350 align:start position:0%
is a good bill
um

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
it allows us to hire more people
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
people we desperately need
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
um the way it goes around it it's
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
extending the state of emergency not
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
state of emergency but the emergency
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
authorization by another two year and
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
the committee i think the members of
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee felt that the emergency has
 
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.789 align:start position:0%
committee felt that the emergency has
been

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
over for a little while so why extended
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
another two years to have a four year
 
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:09.910 align:start position:0%
another two years to have a four year
emergency

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
so we've got to fix it in a different
 
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.030 align:start position:0%
so we've got to fix it in a different
way

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
and one of my questions
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
maybe the director can answer that since
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
all those licenses expired
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
five months ago four months ago like how
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
are they those people operating
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
if you would like
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we'll have more questions
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
and i'm good with them working i'm just
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
curious at this to the process
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um for the
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
record lindsey courtney executive
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
director oplc
 
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
what we did in january in order to avoid
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
the expiration of
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
the emergency licenses as you may recall
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
january looks different than
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
april does in 2022
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
is we converted via emergency rule
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
all of those licenses to temporary
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
licenses under existing statutory
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
authority which is in 310a so those
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
licenses actually don't expire until may
 
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.390 align:start position:0%
licenses actually don't expire until may
31st

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
31st
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it was really intended to give the
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
legislature an opportunity to determine
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
what if anything to do with these
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions please
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative golly thank you mr chair
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
obviously if this is amended it's got to
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
go back to the senate for approval and
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
still got to go to the governor
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not this would be done by may
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
31st what would happen at that point
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
if it was not done by may 31st all of
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
those licenses would expire um
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
we do not have
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
further extend those licenses
 
00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.150 align:start position:0%
further extend those licenses
please

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
and
we

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair i don't believe we can go back
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
retroactively to reinstate those
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
licenses either
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
statutorily so that that puts us
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
in a quandary as to whether or not
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
knows this is in the pipeline and we can
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
really push this forward and
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
fast track it to get it done before may
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
31st i'm hoping that could be done if we
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
do something
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
and and then there was uh one other
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
question um that i had
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.870 align:start position:0%
as to
why

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
we continue the mail order pharmacy
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
license at no cost in this legislation
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
right um there were really only two or
 
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.830 align:start position:0%
right um there were really only two or
three

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
instances in which
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
we opera we allowed
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies to operate a mail order
 
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.790 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies to operate a mail order
pharmacy

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not i don't take a position i i
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
personally think that one of the reasons
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
why we recommended converting these
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
licenses to permanent licenses was
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
the loss of revenue to the state
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the mail order pharmacies the
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
loss of revenue has not been significant
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
because it's only been a couple of
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
instances typically the mail order
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacies though the fee is two
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
which is significant um
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh the twenty thousand or so twenty two
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
thousand people uh who did obtain an
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
emergency license uh did so without
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
costs of the state are without cost to
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
them um
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
so you know i i certainly would be
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
so mr chair if i may i i would like to
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
see the amendment removing the line that
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
says at no cost and if they're going to
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
be renewed that they pay the license fee
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
please which line
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
or i guess my question is do we even
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
need that section in if we're going to
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
charge the license fee can we just
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
strike out that section with the
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
emergency order yeah i think you could
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
we are currently charging a fee for new
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses that we're issuing
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
so mr chair
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
will of the committee i would uh
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
move that we strike out that whole
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
section from line 12 to
 
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
section from line 12 to
15.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.829 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the the draft amendment by the
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
director right here
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
we all got it um that's the shorter page
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what happens to section
 
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what happens to section
three

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.030 align:start position:0%
three
um

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
if the director can come and come back
 
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.949 align:start position:0%
if the director can come and come back
yes

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
no actually there are
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
many licenses license tapes that are
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
multi-state licenses when
 
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.230 align:start position:0%
multi-state licenses when
yep

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
no for nursing for example we issue
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
compact licenses which are considered
 
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.509 align:start position:0%
compact licenses which are considered
multi-state

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
no i i can appreciate that
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
um i think at representative you
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
probably um
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
you probably would need to change a
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
section three as well
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think section three
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
deals with the continuing issuing of
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
licenses so this bill really is intended
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do two things
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
one is to convert the existing emergency
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
allies or to extend the expiration date
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the existing emergency licenses to
 
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
of the existing emergency licenses to
2024

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then to continue to authorize oplc
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
to issue emergency licenses
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
i will say that we are we have observed
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
a significant increase in the in the
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
amount of correspondence related to the
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
student nursing emergency licenses
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
which would
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
fall under section
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
three when it states that the office of
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
professional licensure certification
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
shall continue to offer and issue
 
00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:11.509 align:start position:0%
shall continue to offer and issue
emergency

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
licenses for health care workers and
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
those licenses would expire january 31st
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
of 2024. so i don't i don't think that
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
there would be a need to
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
convert those licenses because section 3
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
is talking about licenses issued in the
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
in the future whereas section one is
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
i i still would like to see
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
2024 change to 2023. um i don't think we
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
need to go
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
out to 2024 giving emergency licenses at
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
this point um if there is a need um we
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
can come back next year and extend it
 
00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
can come back next year and extend it
out

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
i guess my question to the director is
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
if we keep section 3 in does that fiscal
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
note still stand
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's the issue i have the 680
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think giving folks until january 31st
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
2023 is
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
i i do think that the fiscal note would
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
change i i don't know off the top of my
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
head you know i wouldn't be able to do
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
that calculation right now but i think
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
certainly there would be a change uh to
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note if you were to change
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to the extent that we're
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
issuing licenses without a without a fee
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
so certainly you could make that
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
modification that we issue licenses with
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
a fee
 
00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.509 align:start position:0%
a fee
um

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
additionally if you if we were to
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
convert the licenses and they would be
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
required to renew they would have to
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
meet all requirements which would
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
include paying the fee on renewal
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
but if you were to just extend out the
 
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.509 align:start position:0%
but if you were to just extend out the
licenses

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
an additional two years
 
00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.629 align:start position:0%
an additional two years
without

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
without receiving fees for those
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
licenses then yes that could potentially
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
be a loss because those people would not
 
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.629 align:start position:0%
be a loss because those people would not
have

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
sought potentially permanent licensure
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
and actually paid the fee but they
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
caught but the
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
but the fiscal impact really isn't
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
determinable because we don't know how
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
many of those would decline not to seek
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
permanent licensure as a result of
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
having the emergency license it's just
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'd prefer to see it go to 2023.
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
english thank you um please microphone
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i would set the date to
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
when when can the next legislative
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
session realistically do it so that
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're not doing oh this is already
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
expired what are we doing and you know
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more into some halfway
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
through 2024 or something before
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
i mean halfway through 20 30 23 rather
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
than january 31st
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
when will they when will they be meeting
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.150 align:start position:0%
when will they when will they be meeting
in

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
summer the senate the house the governor
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
signing it some work time
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean jane is in january kind of
 
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.710 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean jane is in january kind of
unrealistic

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think there comes a point where we
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
decide whether we're
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
truly in a still in a state of emergency
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
for this or we need to look at these
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
folks and say listen you either need to
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
get a new hampshire license
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not you're
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
staying here
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
for that reason or
 
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.509 align:start position:0%
for that reason or
not

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
and that's do we we need to set a
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
deadline on that not just using an
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
emergency as i see your point but it
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
just in terms we're kind of scrambling
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
with this because the date was not
 
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.829 align:start position:0%
with this because the date was not
realistic

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
and that seems like january 31st is also
 
00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.829 align:start position:0%
and that seems like january 31st is also
not

00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
realistic right i mean they're not even
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
swearing people in for the next session
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
until then so i have a question then why
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't we convert section three just the
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
same to the regular licenses what's the
 
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
same to the regular licenses what's the
drawback

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
drawback
 
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.110 align:start position:0%
drawback
maybe

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
so section 3 would allow us to continue
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
to issue emergency licenses based on the
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
limited criteria for out-of-state
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
licensees that they have a license in
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
good standing it would also allow us to
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
continue to issue licenses to student
 
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
continue to issue licenses to student
nurses

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
and medical fellows with respect to the
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
first category there was a bill
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 that would have
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
allowed the office to issue licenses
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
permanent licenses based on that
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
criteria but obviously we there was
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
significant concern from certain
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups so that bill was
 
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups so that bill was
amended

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
to essentially study the issue and i
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
part of that study
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee could be
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
what do we do with these
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
because certainly portability is an
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
issue in the state the way we fixed it
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
temporarily during the pandemic was to
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
allow us to issue these licenses but the
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
question is how do we pull that back
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
if we convert
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
most of them to permanent licenses when
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
is the next renewal is it yearly and
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
they have to qualify it depends on the
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
licensed profession so they all renew
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
most of them renew on a biennial basis
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
um nurses for example renew the month of
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
their birthday
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
um physicians though only renew in june
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
um june 30th is a common renewal date so
 
00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
um june 30th is a common renewal date so
um

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
so if you were to convert them i think
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
that you would have to
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
potentially change the effective date to
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
just like the amendment recommends
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
the concern would be right if if the if
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
you were to convert them
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
if the bill were in effect june 1st
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden 15 000
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
physicians have to renew
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
in a 15 day period that would be
 
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.949 align:start position:0%
in a 15 day period that would be
problematic

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.710 align:start position:0%
problematic
um

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be requi we wouldn't be
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
providing the required statutory notice
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
of 60 days
 
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.630 align:start position:0%
of 60 days
so

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
i might say you know rather than
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
one thing you could do on the proposed
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
amendment because of course when we
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
drafted this we were anticipating maybe
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
this would be an earlier bill
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
you could say converted to a permanent
 
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.270 align:start position:0%
you could say converted to a permanent
license

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:49.770 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.710 align:start position:0%
you know
[Music]

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
or you could say for purposes of renewal
 
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:02.549 align:start position:0%
or you could say for purposes of renewal
um

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay no this is fine the way it's
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
written for purposes of renewal the date
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
of conversion shall be deemed the date
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
of original issuance so they actually
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to renew right away
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
i apologize representative for talking
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
this through
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
would would senator clegg want to
 
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.990 align:start position:0%
would would senator clegg want to
testify

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any input on the summer
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
camps because we got the
 
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.630 align:start position:0%
camps because we got the
what

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
the the camps have a problem with
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
and it's the same problem i think that
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
everybody does that has a provision that
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
says you have to have a registered nurse
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
so one we're having a hard time finding
 
00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:51.590 align:start position:0%
so one we're having a hard time finding
them

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
and two the ones that we have have come
 
00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
and two the ones that we have have come
here

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
and they've been working into temporary
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
licenses so we really need to have this
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
fixed before
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
june because our camping season and our
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
youth camps open in june
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you do if it if it helps us
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to work with the senate to
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
see if we can't get them to rush it
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
through to the governor's desk to get it
 
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.669 align:start position:0%
through to the governor's desk to get it
done

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
to us it's it's a matter of of life or
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
death if this doesn't go through we
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
can't open without registered nurses
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
so what's the timeline in your mind
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
what does it mean is it me
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
well we have right june 1st
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
if we if we're amended here we we don't
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
have a choice i don't know when your
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
next session is if you can get it on
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
your calendar right away then we can get
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
the senate to be nice if all their
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
regular stuff expires june 30th as she
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
just said just make it june 30th this is
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
may 31st i believe the temporary
 
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
may 31st i believe the temporary
extension

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
the sooner you get it on your calendar
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
then as soon as you get it passed we'll
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
go big in the senate to to get them to
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
push it and we'll speak to the
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
governor's office obviously it's it's
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
it's very important to everybody
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are having the same issue
 
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are having the same issue
so

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
anything we can do
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
to ease it up just for this year i'm
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
some kind of resolution permanent
 
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
some kind of resolution permanent
resolution

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
overall requirements for licensing and
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
the places to call for licensed people
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we may not i mean
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
why do you need a registered nursing
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
nurse at a youth camp other than one for
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
people with special needs
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't disagree
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
and and i think that if we felt that
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
there was a need be nice to to be able
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
to hire some emts that that maybe have i
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
mean you know those are perfect
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
part of the issue that's being addressed
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
in that study committee that we were
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you and
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
there was a note from
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
with psychology something about
 
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:57.430 align:start position:0%
with psychology something about
psychology

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
oh yes the um
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
these are some so we've already covered
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
with that the
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that psychology has some
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
requirements for permanent license
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
is something we're covering in in the
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
study of mental health licenses we just
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
approved yesterday
 
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
approved yesterday
okay

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why there's so many temporary
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
and emergency licenses in psychology is
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for a permanent license
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
are felt by many people to be excessive
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
my inclination is to strike all the
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
dates out and either convert everybody
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that they get
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
through get to go through the renewal
 
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.029 align:start position:0%
through get to go through the renewal
process

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
whenever is applicable
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to come back to do this
 
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to come back to do this
again

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
the representative is one of the
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
possibilities to just leave it as it is
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
expiring january 1st 2024
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
31st 2024 just pass it as it is
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
then we don't have to go to the senate
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
we don't you know just boom is that
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that accelerate things with no
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
changes no amendment but then we got to
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
deal with it next year again same
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
i would note that it also adds a 700 000
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
hit to the oplc in the fiscal note if we
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
leave it as is and i i can't support
 
00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.590 align:start position:0%
leave it as is and i i can't support
that

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
well relative to the 60 million dollars
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
we just spent on lunches or whatever i
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
say that's a mere bag of hell that's a
 
00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:32.950 align:start position:0%
say that's a mere bag of hell that's a
difference

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
we got to discuss this bill
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
not your other bills
 
00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:38.549 align:start position:0%
not your other bills
um

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so we may have difficulty passing
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
just suggesting that that would sort of
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
everybody seems concerned that we're
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
going to run out of time here and
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
i think we just discussed and we'll just
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
pass it as it is and it seems like the
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
governor would
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
care about kids a lot and rush it
 
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.230 align:start position:0%
care about kids a lot and rush it
through

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
in summer camps and everything else so i
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
think we have a good chance um as uh mr
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
clegg testified
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
i think representative golly has um
 
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
i think representative golly has um
concerns

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
both i agree that the amendment we get
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
from oplc
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
is sufficient and i would also ask that
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
if we amend this that we remove the out
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
of state pharmacy section
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
with the at no cost
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think we've heard that
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's no longer needed
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
from oplc
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
so i think that would be if we're going
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
to do an amendment to remove that
 
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.830 align:start position:0%
to do an amendment to remove that
section

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
12 to 15 you said right yeah okay
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and anything we can do with the date in
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
section three
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i my suggestion
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
would be to leave the date as january
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
31st 2024 even though i agree that it's
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
great opportunity um or it's not in the
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
middle of a session but the reason for
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is i think this issue is going to
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
be fit squarely within the study
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee in sba 330. i think this is
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we have to look
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
at as a state is
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
portability um
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
and that section three is really dealing
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
with portability so hopefully some
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
things will come out of that study
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee that will help inform
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the legislature as to what
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
changes need to occur so i would suggest
 
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
changes need to occur so i would suggest
just

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
leaving it um
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank you one more question line 28
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
section 10 of this act will take effect
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
on the same date 20 um
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
section 10. and why is there another
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
section 10. and why is there another
date

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's hard to find because it's
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
actually in senate bill 155 from last
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
year which has since been repealed um
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
prospectively pursuant to section 10. so
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
section 10 is essentially prospective
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
it prospectively repealed
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
the statute to on january 31st of 2022
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
this would change that prospective
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
repeal to january 31st of 2024
 
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.190 align:start position:0%
repeal to january 31st of 2024
um

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense but you would have
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
to you have to pull up 155 from last
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
do we need this statement here line 28
 
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.549 align:start position:0%
do we need this statement here line 28
itself

00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
um which is section 10 shall take effect
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
on january 31st 2024
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
do we still need it
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
as part of this bill
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think you would need it because there
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
are other parts of
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
that build that 155 that are not
 
00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.230 align:start position:0%
that build that 155 that are not
included

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
in this bill um
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
so i still think you would need
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise you would still have
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
authorization to continue to issue
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses indefinitely but all
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
of those licenses would expire january
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
31st of 2024 so on february 1st of 2024
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
we could issue a license but it would
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
expire the day prior
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay so this fixes something
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
in another bill kind of
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
this line fixes something in another
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill yes it eliminates the authority of
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
the office to issue those emergency
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
licenses yep
 
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
any further comments so
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
well so it looks like this the plc draft
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislation the amendment
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's good
 
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:32.510 align:start position:0%
to go forward
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:39.750 align:start position:0%
to go forward
[Music]

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
well once it does we're no longer fast
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
tracking it so then i guess you could
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
pick a date out of the air that you want
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
one that works
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
if all the new licenses are being issued
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
june 30th then
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
why not make this june 30th instead of
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
january 21st 31st or whatever
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
so in section one we're striking the
 
00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
so in section one we're striking the
date

00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:02.950 align:start position:0%
date
uh

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh and it's been replaced here by this
 
00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:06.389 align:start position:0%
uh and it's been replaced here by this
amendment

00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
but section three and section
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
and line 28
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
i see still have that date january 31st
 
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.830 align:start position:0%
i see still have that date january 31st
2024

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
should the 2024 be changed
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
or something else is that the question
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
well representative goalie seemed to
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
think it was important that it be 2023
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
but january
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
31st doesn't seem to work in 2023 make
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
it june 30th 2023 and then it would at
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative golly i think uh for
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
section 3 and line 28 at the end
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
and or the director
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
should we change it to
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
summer june of 2023
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
instead of january 31st of 24 both those
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i believe so so
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
so section one will no longer have a
 
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
so section one will no longer have a
date

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
it will be replaced by the amendment and
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
then section
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
3's date will change to summer june of
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
2023 and then line 28 date will change
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
to the same summer june
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
june what
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
okay
right

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
one for section one section one is the
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
amendment right i got that one but what
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
was the section two goes away um line 12
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%

june okay and then line 28
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
we changed the date also to june 30th of
 
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.669 align:start position:0%
we changed the date also to june 30th of
23.

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
23.
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

please
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
the current licenses or the need to
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
renew licenses and it would give all the
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
senate and the governor time to deal
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay are we
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.430 align:start position:0%
good
audience

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
audience
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
i want to see if carol
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
when she comes back if she's got any
 
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:11.269 align:start position:0%
when she comes back if she's got any
input

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
oh try to get it drafted maybe we'll
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
do we care that the fiscal note changes
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
because of our
 
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.830 align:start position:0%
because of our
adjustments

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:32:41.840 --> 00:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
adjustments
now

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then the question just um
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
procedural technical questions so
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden all these temporary
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
licenses get converted
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
to regular licenses will the people know
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
please representative
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
so how do you know notify them by email
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
you put it on the website
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
we typically don't mail viu and smail
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
the only board we're mailing for right
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
now is board of barbering because we
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have their email addresses
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
email for the remainder of the boards is
 
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
email for the remainder of the boards is
um

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
part of the demographic contact
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
information that they're required to
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
keep up to date with the board
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and our experience has been that when
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
we mail things out via snail mail
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
not only is it their significant cost to
 
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.190 align:start position:0%
not only is it their significant cost to
that

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.230 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
it also requires a lot of time for staff
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
to stuff envelopes and the like
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 22 000
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
and we get a lot of return email at we
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
get a lot of return so we don't
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
typically mail out
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
um and in this case it's problematic
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
because 15 000
 
00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
because 15 000
of

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
these individuals
were

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
mass license bulk licensed i if you will
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
pursuant to an emergency order for um
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
because they were new hampshire medicaid
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
enrolled providers practicing in boston
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the oplc
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
does not have a full um
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
we don't even have a full set of all of
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
their their contact information their
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
home contact information that's
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
contained by dhhs
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'm wondering if
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
you when you send out the emails if any
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
of them bounce
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you follow up on that and then try
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
the like regular mail because you know
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
things can happen you know their
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
internet provider can be having a
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
problem or whatever or they maybe they
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
just changed their email address and
 
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.150 align:start position:0%
just changed their email address and
forgot

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
forgot
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
well we send it out multiple times we
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
for traditional renewal notice we send
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
it out 60
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
60 days 15 days and then after
 
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.589 align:start position:0%
60 days 15 days and then after
expiration

00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
expiration
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
um it's incumbent upon the professional
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
to keep their information current and
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
that actually can subject them to
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action if they don't
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know as you can imagine with 200 000
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
licensees and 18 license clerks it's
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
pretty it would be pretty difficult for
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
us to essentially micromanage people's
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
contact information which is why it's a
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's necessary that they do it
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
it becomes a problem when we have a
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and they haven't
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
updated their contact information and we
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
need to do an investigation that's
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
really why
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that technically is a requirement of
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
an ethical requirement
 
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
an ethical requirement
so

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
i asked you if when an email bounces you
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
maybe revert to the u.s mail and is your
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer no correct my answer is no we do
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
and did i also hear that you have people
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
that are licensed and you don't even
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
know their their residence you don't
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
even know their
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
address where they are we have
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
individuals who are issued an emergency
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
license pursuant to an emergency rule
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
they are new hampshire medicaid enrolled
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
providers meaning that dhhs has access
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
to all of their information
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we worked with our agency partner to
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
issue them those licenses and dhhs
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
facilitated that communication
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay so is your plan to move that data
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
into your database correct that would be
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
part of the plan if the legislature
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
would move forward with converting those
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
licenses but because if they were just
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to emergency for two years and
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
that would be the end of it then it kind
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
of like didn't matter correct and if you
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
may recall originally emergency
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
licensure was supposed to be for a
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
couple weeks right we didn't anticipate
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
this need for this transferring of all
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
this data so it has it has transformed
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
into something else such that now we
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
need to we need to plan to to migrate
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
good question um to the director can we
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
put something in here to help you
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
with that process
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
can you give me like 400 more people
 
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.550 align:start position:0%
can you give me like 400 more people
no

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
i think i think from a legislative
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint um
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh we should be we should be upset but i
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay i mean
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
you've got a few minutes before we stand
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
it for amendment thank you thank you
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%

well it takes a while yeah
but

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
i really want to submit it
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
say it again do this again next monday
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
without schedule for next monday morning
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
if we have here i believe we might have
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
hearings monday um if we could meet at
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock to review the amendment and
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
pass it i mean it's not going to go
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
forward to the house until the
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
may 5th so we still have plenty of time
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
but if we could review it and get it
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
next week for an exact then it would be
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
on its way yeah but
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can get it by the end
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%

of time to get it together and make sure
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%

monday we have time to do some executing
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
and we can move this through um to get
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
it ready for the next house session on
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
may 5th
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%

we're here we're doing the full
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%

00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.349 align:start position:0%

i don't see the director here
 
00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:38.150 align:start position:0%
i don't see the director here
um

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
quite the only question i have is if we
 
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.430 align:start position:0%
quite the only question i have is if we
remove

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
in removing section two if you go down
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
to line 26
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
it says emergency licensing procedures
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
and out-of-state pharmacies if we're
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
taking that out we may need to strike
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
out out-of-state pharmacies on that line
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's a question okay we
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
can um she's not here but that would be
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
a question i would ask i think we can
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
remove that
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
if two is gone does that
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
and then the last change is line
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
um 28 which engine into june june 30th
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%

earlier this year
 
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
earlier this year
um

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
just on a
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
general basis this is a bill about
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
competition it's a bill about fairness
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
and it's a bill about
 
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.510 align:start position:0%
and it's a bill about
transparency

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
transparency
unlike

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.430 align:start position:0%
unlike
um

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
past efforts
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
regarding project labor agreements this
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill only applies to state projects
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
there was a bill
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
a year ago that applied to state and
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
local projects
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
that any local projects has been
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i'm told and you'll
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
hear uh testimony
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
on this fact
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
later this morning
 
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.750 align:start position:0%
later this morning
that

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.870 align:start position:0%
that
90

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
90
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
um of people who work in the
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
construction industry are
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
not unionized
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so what a project labor agreement
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
does it requires if the state requires
 
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.430 align:start position:0%
does it requires if the state requires
it

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
for collective bargaining
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
for project labor agreement on wages on
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
benefits and so in essence it creates
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
favored treatment for the 10
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
of the workforce that in the
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
is unionized the senate heard testimony
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you'll hear the same
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
tend to drive up costs
 
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.029 align:start position:0%
tend to drive up costs
and

01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that's certainly something that we
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
should be concerned about as we're
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
trying to protect taxpayers
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
especially with a lot of new
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure dollars in new hampshire
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
so let me just walk you briefly through
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bill the purpose statement is as i
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
articulated it's about fair competition
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
and it says on line 5 that the state
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
shall not include project labor
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
agreements as part of a competitive bid
 
01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.349 align:start position:0%
agreements as part of a competitive bid
process

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:43.359 --> 01:04:44.470 align:start position:0%
process
so

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at line 18 it defines
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
government entity as the state
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
no other public entity its state of new
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire contracts
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
on line 22 it
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
defines what a project labor agreement
 
01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
defines what a project labor agreement
is

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's something that establishes the
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions of employment for a
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
specific construction project
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
and then it gets into the meat of the
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
bill starting on line 25
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
where it says no state
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
again government assisted project shall
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
include the following in its bid
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
specifications and then it continues on
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
to page two as to what
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
is not allowed in the bid requirement so
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
a prohibition
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
of for project labor agreement
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
is articulated on lines one through
 
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.190 align:start position:0%
is articulated on lines one through
seven

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
seven
however

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
and i want to be really clear on this
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
what it doesn't do
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
contractor wants to have a project labor
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
agreement that they have entered into
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
with a union
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
set of construction workers there is
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill on a state contract
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
that would preclude it what it precludes
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
is the state mandating
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
and you can see that
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
starting on page 2 line 9 and in
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
particular on line 17 where it says
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
you can voluntarily enter into a project
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
labor agreement
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
there is an exception
 
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.029 align:start position:0%
there is an exception
um

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
on line 27
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
if there are special circumstances and a
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
finding that is required
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of the bill
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's a fairly simple bill
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's narrow in that it only applies to
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire construction
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
projects and i hope that this committee
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
will go forward with it thank you madam
 
01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
will go forward with it thank you madam
chair

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there any
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative marsh
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
senator for coming to us and presenting
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
this bill to us i have a question
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
particularly about the meaning of
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
government assisted on lines 20 and 21
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
and page 1 of the bill
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
in particular that refers to rsa 79e the
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
community revitalization revitalization
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
tax incentive
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
would i be correct that that would
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
include the economic opportunity zone in
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
manchester center around the notre dame
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
bridge where the advanced regenerative
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
manufacturing institute is currently
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
located making that project a
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
government-assisted project
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
i am not sure of the answer to that um
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative marsh i think it would be
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
best to ask um
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
other witnesses that will come behind me
 
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.549 align:start position:0%
other witnesses that will come behind me
that

01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
follow up um i i believe that uh
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
we'll hear that later on um
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
we know that the city of manchester
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
recently received a five hundred
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars from the
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
buildback better regional challenge
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
program to plan establishing a cluster
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
in that area and they're currently
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
competing for a 100 million dollar grant
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
in phase two of that
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
i happen to get the notice of funding uh
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity executive summary which i
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
would be glad to share and i note that
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
on page 21
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
grant that they have applied for it is
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
required that they get a detailed plan
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
on how the coalition will engage
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
community-based organizations and our
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
labor unions how the project will
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
incorporate strong labor standards and
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
economic benefits for local residents
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
including project labor agreements and
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
community benefit agreements that offer
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
wages at or above the prevailing rate
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
and included local higher provisions
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
my question relates to this project
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
which i had thought you were in favor of
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
uh is it your intention to make it less
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
likely that the the
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
city of manchester and their partners
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
will receive this grant or possibly
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
marsh you we cannot question intentions
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
oh you should ask is would the effect of
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
this bill be too okay with the effect
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
of that question madam chair
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
if you look on representative marsh on
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
line 18 government enemy means the state
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
i think you're referring to a city of
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
manchester project
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i think the question
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
relates upon the uh what the definition
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
of government assisted is which i asked
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
we asked you before i have one other
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up question madam chair
 
01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
follow-up question madam chair
follow-up

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
i think we all can agree that the
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
department of transportation
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
is a part of the state of new hampshire
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the department of transportation uh
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
also competes for discretionary grants i
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
have in front of me
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
notice a funding opportunity for the
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
department of transportation's national
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment the rebuilding
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
america infrastructure with
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
sustainability and equity grant program
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i note on that
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
on page 25 that again uh the
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
these grants require the use of project
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
labor agreements uh so uh
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
would this bill make it less likely that
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
transportation would successfully
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
compete for such uh grants and make it
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
unable for the state to actually
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
build these projects i don't believe so
 
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.830 align:start position:0%
build these projects i don't believe so
thank

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you tell me
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
if the state of new hampshire has ever
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
had a pla agreement
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has never
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
entered into a pla but with all of the
 
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.910 align:start position:0%
entered into a pla but with all of the
infrastructure

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
money that's
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
floating around the state of new
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire and some of the surplus
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
dollars that we're allocating for
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
different projects
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that
 
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.669 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that
we

01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
enact this legislation to protect
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as i think you would probably
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
be aware
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
according to information that i've seen
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the job corps center in manchester
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
had more bidders after a project labor
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
agreement was
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
not adhered to and the cost came in at i
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
think it was about 15 percent less
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
open competition i think that's what
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to establish here
 
01:11:21.679 --> 01:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
we're trying to establish here
follow-up

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up is
 
01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:28.390 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up is
with

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
all the money coming uh
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
in the transportation the 1.3 billion
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that's being
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
dispersed trillion that's being
 
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.229 align:start position:0%
dispersed trillion that's being
dispersed

01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
our

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
projects with
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
blas giving a higher
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
grade and a higher uh greater ability to
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
get some of those projects if they
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that again this only
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
applies to state contracts
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would hope you would join me in the
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
intent of trying to make sure that
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
90 of the workforce in this state that
 
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
90 of the workforce in this state that
is

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
not part of a union has as much access
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
actually do the work
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
and do it on time and hopefully under
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
budget and at less cost to taxpayers i
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative goalie i just
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on that comment it
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
are you saying that
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
the ten percent
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
will always overbid the 90
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
and they're not competitive
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
other witnesses
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
that will come after me that are in the
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
field in the construction field that can
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
offer that kind of evidence i think the
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
senate heard testimony that
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements generally cost
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
20 percent more
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
in my high school years i went to don
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
bosco technical high school in boston
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then from there i went to
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts maritime academy i feel at
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
don bosco they gave me college prep and
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
they also gave me a trade i feel that in
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
my life experience i done better with
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the trade than i did with the college
 
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.350 align:start position:0%
the trade than i did with the college
education

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill by eliminating
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh the potential of unions which has
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
journeyman's and quite an exhaustive
 
01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
journeyman's and quite an exhaustive
process

01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
to which
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
a person can come in join the union
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
learn that particular trade and become
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
an expert
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know true professional in that trade
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
by eliminating that 10 percent
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
are we doing the state
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even municipalities a
 
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.110 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even municipalities a
disservice

01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
disservice
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
by having less than qualified labor in
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
working in this
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
for is it not most labor standards copy
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
or mirror the requirements that like a
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
trained journeyman
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh or a licensed uh plumber or something
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
like that would follow
 
01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
like that would follow
so

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the bill
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay and if you look at
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
page 2
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that prohibits a
 
01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.149 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that prohibits a
contractor

01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
themselves from entering into a project
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
labor agreement if they choose to do so
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
there may be reasons that they would
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to voluntarily do that
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is say the state
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
should not enter into a project labor
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
agreement and i think given that we want
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
to have benefits for taxpayers
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
get projects that
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
will have more bidders and free and open
 
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.149 align:start position:0%
will have more bidders and free and open
competition

01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate to protect taxpayers
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
on the other hand the fact that a
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
contractor can enter into
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
a pla and it has nothing to do with the
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
counties or the state are the counties
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
or municipalities there's only the state
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
this is not undermining um
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
labor unions they'll still be able to
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
have project labor agreements but it has
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
to come
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
from the contractor
 
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.310 align:start position:0%
from the contractor
follow-up

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of what i'm kind of
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
talking about because by this particular
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
bill it would eliminate a labor
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
organization from participating to 10
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
percent per se no i don't think that's
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
the case sir
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's not don't yes at all i would just
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state could not demand a project
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
labor agreement there is nothing that
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
would prohibit a
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
contract or a contractor working for the
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
state that voluntarily wanted to do that
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
because they felt it was the best thing
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
to enter into a pla from doing it but it
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
would say the state is not going to set
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
it as a precondition of getting that
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
contract so that's where
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up if i may
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
well in the beating bidding process is
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
that part of the free and open
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
competition currently does exist why do
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
we need this particular band-aid
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
well i think i've answered that question
 
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.270 align:start position:0%
well i think i've answered that question
already

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.229 align:start position:0%
already
okay

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
senator bradley this is a little bit new
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
to me so
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
my question was very similar to how
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
represent representative o'brien's
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
question why is this bill needed i'm
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
sorry if you've answered that question
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
it went
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
through one ear and out the other so if
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
you could kindly repeat it i would
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much because i we let
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
me just
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
we do not require these plas now is that
 
01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
we do not require these plas now is that
correct

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
so the best of my knowledge
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
there haven't been
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
state requirements for a pla that being
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
said what this would say is the state is
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
not going
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the future to require a pla because
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that i articulated that
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
90 of the workforce is non-union
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
plas generally are higher priced
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up representative thank
 
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.630 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up representative thank
you

01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to say that the
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
state's not going to require it
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
but the contractors can require it
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
if the contractor because remember the
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
contractors are are bidding on state
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
contracts is usually an rfp that's put
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
out we want to get as many bidders as
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
possible to get the best price and the
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
best quality that's generally how
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
state contracts are awarded
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
if a contractor themselves believes that
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
put together the best bid using a
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement nothing in this
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill would preclude that if what it
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow is the state to demand as
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
a precondition
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
a project labor agreement so it's very
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
different if a contractor themselves
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
want to do it because they feel it's in
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
the best interest of winning the bid
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of price quality
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
ability to get work done on time they
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
can do that there's nothing that would
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows did you have a
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.310 align:start position:0%
representative fellows did you have a
question

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really expert in this area
 
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.270 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really expert in this area
either

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm i know that
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
state the state
 
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:06.870 align:start position:0%
state the state
um

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
um
will

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
issue an rfp for a contract
 
01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.390 align:start position:0%
issue an rfp for a contract
that

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
uses all or partly federal money
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
so does federal money ever come with a
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
requirement to do this or
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
um something like a preference
 
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
um something like a preference
for

01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
um related to labor unions i mean that
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
could be a term and a condition of um a
 
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
could be a term and a condition of um a
federal

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
award of a grant my understanding is
 
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:38.790 align:start position:0%
award of a grant my understanding is
that

01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion about
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
projects that are over 35 million
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
dollars would have to
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
um to conform with the federal bid
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
process that's my understanding but
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
you'd be better advised to ask that
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
so it i have a follow-up to that
 
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
so it i have a follow-up to that
follow-up

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
the other half of the question it it's
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's on one end so i'm going to look
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
at the other end also the state awards
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
money to municipalities for things like
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment and roads and stuff
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
they would not be impacted that would be
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
a municipal um
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm concerned that this bill might
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:28.390 align:start position:0%
do that
because

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the municipality would be
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing the contract
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
but it would involve some money from the
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
27 of the first page
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
it says no state government assisted
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
project which to me sounds like a
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
assistance of state money so let me just
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
say this if the committee wants to
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is that it is
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
state contracts
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
and if the committee wants to clarify
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
that i would not
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
it doesn't strike me that the bill
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
the wording of the bill says that but is
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
your intent that this only applies to
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
state contracts using a hundred percent
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
state money
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
that was as the bill was brought to me
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
rep for them for the senator
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much okay
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you're welcome
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
i thank you madam chair and members of
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is arnold davis
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
representing coast district 2. also as a
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
freshman rep this is the first time i
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
speak in front of a committee
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
so if i develop a stammer or facial
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
twitches i'm not having a stroke i'm
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
just a little nervous
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'm here before you today
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
to voice my opposition to senate bill
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
274 relative to governmental
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
construction contracts
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 274 is a bill that is a
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
not only that but if passed it is a
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
solution that could mean new hampshire
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
losing millions of dollars in federal
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
funding for infrastructure that our
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
state desperately needs to repair its
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
supporters of senate bill 274 claim that
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will foster competition
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
and will ensure that taxpayers are
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
getting what they pay for
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
in reality this bill if it becomes law
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
will make a process of bidding on the
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
state construction projects less
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
competitive by favoring contractors that
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
are paying their workers less
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in the bill that
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
guarantees competition or even that new
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
will be employed to work on the state
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
funded construction projects
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
what is most troubling about this bill
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
is the unintended consequences that will
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
result if
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
it becomes law right now new hampshire
 
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
it becomes law right now new hampshire
is

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
in desperate need of federal
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
of funding to repair our infrastructure
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and passing this bill into law could
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
result in our state not being selected
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
for federal infrastructure funding
 
01:23:45.679 --> 01:23:46.709 align:start position:0%
for federal infrastructure funding
awards

01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
awards
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan infrastructure law
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
that was passed by congress and signed
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
by the president lays out the criteria
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
that will be evaluated to choose who and
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
where federal infrastructure funding
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
will be awarded
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
in one of the elements for deciding
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
where this funding should go
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh labor standards and project labor
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
agreements on proposed infrastructure
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
projects i have serious concerns about
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
passing a bill that would right off the
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
bat diminish new hampshire's chances of
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
receiving badly needed federal funding
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
in the north country infrastructure
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
money is
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
probably needed more than anywhere else
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the state and the fact that the
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors did not take into consideration
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
that passing this bill could hurt our
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
chances at receiving this funding is
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
reason enough for us to oppose it but i
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
also believe we as legislators should be
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
supporting bills that seek
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
to solve problems that our state is
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
actually facing
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
and as new hampshire
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
has never had a pla
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
this bill seems only to add to
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
governmental red tape in further
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
regulation of the new hampshire
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire has never mandated a
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement for a
 
01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:09.590 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement for a
state-funded

01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
state-funded
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
construction process in its history why
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
are we being asked to pass a bill that
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
would prohibit something that has never
 
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.229 align:start position:0%
would prohibit something that has never
happened

01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
there are far more pressing issues that
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed by the legislature
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
passing senate bill 274 to benefit one
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
group of cons contractors
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
is not a good enough reason to
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
jeopardize millions of dollars in
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
federal funding for infrastructure or to
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
tie the hands of the state from using
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
an efficiency tool like a project labor
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
agreement in the future
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
we should not be in the process of
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
picking winners and loses
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
and that is what this bill will do
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
if it becomes law i respectfully ask you
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
to vote itl on this bill
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
and not to risk our chances of receiving
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
funding that
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
my community desperately needs thank you

want extra government red tape this
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the new hampshire way
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects this bill will
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
not bring a single extra penny to our
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
state coffers
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
as president of the sea trust me when i
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
say our state faces rampant vacancies
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
for example the new hampshire department
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
of employment security has over 700
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
vacant job listings
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
for skilled workers in construction it's
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
been difficult to find workers because
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
this economy workers can choose to be
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
very selective
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
workers want good paying jobs with
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
benefits and protections
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
let's kill this bill and increase the
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
chances of more federal dollars
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
returning to the granite state
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr gullah are you okay to take
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
mr gold for taking my question um we
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
heard in this house a similar bill
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
kind of similar in a way
 
01:28:55.679 --> 01:28:57.030 align:start position:0%
kind of similar in a way
that

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
what has stopped any state funding into
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
a rail project something near and dear
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
to me from the commuter rail into new
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire that affects the
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
d.o.t workers that you may represent
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
and now i'm looking at this particular
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
bill and it seems like new hampshire
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
can't see past his nose the benefits of
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
true infrastructure and revitalization
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
into this community to how much it can
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
help the state raise money and try to
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
help to alleviate
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
some of the burden with the taxpayers
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh so therefore
 
01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.270 align:start position:0%
uh so therefore
uh

01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know this is kind of a loaded
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
question but
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
is is this kind of like an anti-worker
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
type of a situation that we see out here
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
by some members of this legislature to
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
against the state from actually growing
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
and thriving representative please don't
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
speak of other representatives intent
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i apologize madam chair
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh it's just that that it was
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
just a more than casual observation
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh but i'll leave it at that if you want
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
to impine on what i had to say
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
it certainly feels that way
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
are there any other members that have
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman for the record
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
my name's gary abbott i'm the executive
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
vice president of the associated general
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
contractors of new hampshire
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
i have distributed a position paper
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
along with the history of
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
government mandated labor agreements in
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
public construction
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
white paper
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
from our national organization
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
so you can have that information to make
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure that you completely understand what
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about as far as labor
 
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.149 align:start position:0%
we're talking about as far as labor
agreements

01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
i think jeb bradley did a great job in
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
his testimony
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
i look at this bill we are so in support
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
as it does one thing it protects new
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire contractors
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's union or open shop
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
when these pla agreements come under the
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
federal government that has recently
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
been talked about
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
those are federally
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
controlled projects
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're administrated by say the army or
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
the national guard
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
those are administered by those federal
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
governments if they require plas they
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much rule out new hampshire
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
contractors from doing the work
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is a protection bill of new
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire contractors
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i plead with the committee that's
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about this bill isn't
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
about separating union
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
from open shop
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
i represent some union firms as well as
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
open shop firms
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do is preserve
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
the free marketplace in new hampshire
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to maintain that the
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
companies that work and live here
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
are maintained
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
this project this bill limits it
 
01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.390 align:start position:0%
this project this bill limits it
to

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
state projects now i know there's some
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
language in here that needs to be
 
01:32:46.639 --> 01:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
language in here that needs to be
changed

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure it's very clear
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
i know the language that was used in the
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
buy america steel bill that you heard
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
had language that said state
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
administered projects that may be better
 
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
administered projects that may be better
language

01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
used in this bill i'm just throwing that
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
out there as one who's looked at a
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
number of these bills
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think the intent was to move away from
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
municipal projects which have you a
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
number of people have raised those
 
01:33:16.719 --> 01:33:18.550 align:start position:0%
number of people have raised those
questions

01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
i this bill
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
just says and it and it says this other
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
states have adopted similar bills more
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
than 20 other states are adopting bills
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's a protection of the
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense that the government
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't mandate any put conditions on
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
a project
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
that limit
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
the scope of who can bid on the projects
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
based on labor issues
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's really what this bill is about
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
so i would ask that the committee
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
it goes a long way in doing open and
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
fair competition in new hampshire
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
i think you will find that other states
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
are moving in this direction because if
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
a pla was put on a state project most
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
likely we'll get out of state
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
contractors that will be doing the work
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
and some are okay with that but as far
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
as the construction industry we're
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
putting in place something that has been
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
a common practice the practice has been
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we have not had plas to continue
 
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.790 align:start position:0%
and we have not had plas to continue
that

01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
no one has given me a good reason so far
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think it'll stop
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
the money
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter about the state
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
authorizing us i have not seen that
 
01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.149 align:start position:0%
authorizing us i have not seen that
condition

01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
but i think if you were to change some
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
language to state administered projects
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
it would be very clear
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh that you would get rid of some of
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
this state assisted which kind of opens
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
up the gray area but that's my
 
01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.310 align:start position:0%
up the gray area but that's my
recommendation

01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the time today to testify
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
before you but this is a bill in which
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
it looks ahead that these things may
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire and it sets a
 
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.669 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire and it sets a
policy

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are you willing to
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
take questions i i am
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
good morning mr abbott so
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
if you recall because i know you've been
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
in this uh business for a long time
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.109 align:start position:0%
in this uh business for a long time
the

01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:23.119 --> 01:35:24.790 align:start position:0%
the
state

01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislature uh reroofed this very
 
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.550 align:start position:0%
legislature uh reroofed this very
building

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh about
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
15 years ago
 
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.430 align:start position:0%
15 years ago
and

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of problems with that
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
process because
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
without getting into the details
 
01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.189 align:start position:0%
without getting into the details
so

01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
we wound up
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
with a lot of difficulties in getting
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the project completed and
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you recall that so is this bill
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
as it's currently
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
or even with your amended version uh is
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.830 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
likely to put us in a situation that is
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
favorable or unfavorable in terms of our
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
past experience
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
um with
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
construction projects but would it would
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
make no changes to what's currently
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the regulations but
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
you have to understand construction
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications and pre-qualifications
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
that are required like if you go to work
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
for dot
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
you have to be pre-qualified to do the
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
type of work if you're an asphalt they
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
have to pre-approve you to do that work
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
you just can't come in and not be
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
skilled at that work so there are
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
things and protections under the current
 
01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:44.709 align:start position:0%
things and protections under the current
laws

01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
that help the state with making sure
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
that they get qualified contractors this
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
in no way does that this is about
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
the preference of a contractor whether
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
he wants to enter into a legal labor
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
agreement or not is his option
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
but the state can't mandate it to
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
eliminate 90 of the marketplace that
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
really is what about this this is really
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about it's not about
 
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.830 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about it's not about
the

01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifications and the other
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
requirements that are currently in place
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh this doesn't remove any of those this
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
with labor agreements
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so i just want to
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
make sure you completely understand
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's why i put the white paper in
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
front of you that you can kind of
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand the entire process follow up
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
madame peer
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
representatives so there there's been a
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
reference to the fact that some 20 other
 
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
reference to the fact that some 20 other
states

01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
are currently uh you know involved with
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislation of this sort do we have any
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
idea whether any of these
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
other states have experience
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the impact
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
of this type of legislation in terms of
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
how well that works
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know benefiting the contractors and
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
the state and the people thereby
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
or is this all
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
brand new legislation across the board
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
no i more than 20 states have had it in
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
place for i know at least more than two
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
years and have not heard any
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh negative responses to having that in
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
place in those states thank you
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:32.390 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
so

01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
if you could just confirm that the state
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire has never required a
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
pla in any of his contracts
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
not that i'm aware of
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
only the federal project of the
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
the manchester uh project
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
in which that went to court
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
the project labor agreement was moved
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
for the job corps center so it's just
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
something that has highlighted this
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
issue for new hampshire contractors that
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
went through that process we don't want
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
that process to happen for uh
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
state-funded projects
 
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.709 align:start position:0%
state-funded projects
follow-up

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
and you also stated that there are some
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
federal contracts out there that require
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
plas or there may be money tied to
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
a pla for the state of new hampshire to
 
01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
a pla for the state of new hampshire to
receive

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
or a requirement maybe a pla requirement
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
may move you up on the list on whether
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
or not the state receives money funding
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
or granting
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.510 align:start position:0%
is that correct
um

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
state money that has required that the
 
01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:39.510 align:start position:0%
state money that has required that the
state

01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
administer a pla project
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
the reference to the federal government
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
president biden did an executive order
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
in february was an executive order on
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
federal projects over 35 million but
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's not money that comes to the state
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's administered by those federal
 
01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.870 align:start position:0%
it's administered by those federal
agencies

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.229 align:start position:0%
agencies
and

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's problematic for new hampshire
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
but we don't get very many 35 million
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
plus projects
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
for federal projects in the state of new
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire those would be things like the
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
courthouse and the others that are
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
already built so
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
i hope that clarifies here
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
we we are not aware of any requirement
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
that has come down that has a state
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
but in the
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
earlier scenario i put out there is a
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
that is set aside
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
ready to come here to new hampshire for
 
01:40:40.639 --> 01:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
ready to come here to new hampshire for
projects

01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
i know specifically in manchester we
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
have money that we are bidding on
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
for projects that we sent in and
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
submitted to for the federal government
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
to receive funding
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
and those projects
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
may have a pla in them and when we bid
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
them out in manchester and my
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is this could affect that
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
money as it comes through um
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
so as a requirement does that not affect
 
01:41:07.119 --> 01:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
so as a requirement does that not affect
this

01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
legislation would affect those projects
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
well i think if you change it to what i
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier to state
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
administered projects
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
if that federal money comes as a grant
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
from the feds to the town
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh mr abbott if we don't
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
if the state doesn't require it now i
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
guess i'm struggling as to why we need
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
this bill because if it doesn't change
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
anything and we don't require it now why
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
well i think it's a clear policy for the
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
state to make for all state agencies as
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
far as when this question comes up
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll be back here when the
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
first one starts and i think it's a good
 
01:42:01.119 --> 01:42:03.189 align:start position:0%
first one starts and i think it's a good
policy

01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
so as a second term state representative
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you we get a lot of bills
 
01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.510 align:start position:0%
i can tell you we get a lot of bills
so

01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
maybe it's become my personal
 
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.149 align:start position:0%
maybe it's become my personal
mission

01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
but i think we should only we should
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
really serious look at bills that help
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
granite staters and the state needs
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
and if we we're setting a policy that we
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
that already exist because we don't
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
mandate this
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand why
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're just putting a lock on
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
on another lock on a door correct
 
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.229 align:start position:0%
on another lock on a door correct
um

01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
i look at it like i started out in my
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
testimony is
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're putting in place a protection for
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr abbott for taking my
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
question you said for protection of new
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses uh perhaps as you
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
know i come from the firefighting ranks
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
and uh when i was in the committee of
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
transportation we came up with license
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
plate for firefighters and i says uh
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
well what would guarantee a firefighter
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
how would you know and said perhaps
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
maybe having the qualification in
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
education such as firefighter two and i
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
come to find out in the state that you
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
can call yourself a firefighter yet not
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
really meet the same qualifications that
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
i had to meet within the city of nashua
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore removing the safety power
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
of union involvement which has
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
very high standards of method of
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
operations and training and everything
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
else such as you mentioned even in the
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
field of asphalt to make sure that
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
somebody that works for the d.o.t is
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
certified to lay down the asphalt are we
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
not perhaps with this bill removing a
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
potential safety bar of guaranteeing
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
construction projects within the state
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has put in
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
places regulations that require like 10
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
hour osha classes for construction as a
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
mandatory for workers there are other
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
requirements that are already in place
 
01:44:11.679 --> 01:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
requirements that are already in place
that

01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
put in place for whether you work for a
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
union firm or an open shop firm and
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
there are requirements within the
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
industry regarding different
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
fields so i don't believe it has
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
anything to lowering the bar of any kind
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you manager i just have to follow
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
up real brief on a statement you made
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
about trying to protect new hampshire
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
companies and workers are you telling me
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
those that are
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
labor organizations are not new
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers or companies
 
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.629 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers or companies
no

01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
i guess what i want to clarify is
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put it this way i represent
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
both union and open shop
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
and they can compete currently
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
within the new hampshire marketplace
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
they compete on similar jobs
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
but most of the contractors who have
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
labor agreements that have chosen to
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
have labor agreements have them for
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
individual trades their whole company in
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
most cases are not union firms
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
they are union signatory on a project
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
and a project basis and signatory to
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
certain craft
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
even those that i i'm classifying as
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
union do that on occasion
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is their choice and i think that is
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to protect that is
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
not to have the state
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
mandate that through a contract forcing
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
all the other contractors who don't want
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
to do that do that but i i'm i'm saying
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
it protects the marketplace that we have
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
that seems to be functioning fine
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have really complaints and this
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
really is to put in place what we've had
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
for a standard over all these years
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any other
 
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any other
ques

01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
ques
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
abbott for taking my question
 
01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.790 align:start position:0%
abbott for taking my question
um

01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
several many new hampshire contractors
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
don't have large unionized workforces is
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
it not partly because
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
of the practice of designating some of
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
as subcontractors rather than as
 
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
as subcontractors rather than as
employees

01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think you will find on most
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
contracting projects there are
 
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.350 align:start position:0%
contracting projects there are
subcontractors

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
subcontractors
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what the
 
01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.189 align:start position:0%
and what the
and

01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm not really following your
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
question because i think that's a
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
standard practice that if you build a
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
building you're going to have electrical
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
contractors you're going to have
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
plumbing contractors you're going to
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
have many different fields
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
the project labor agreement would be for
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
the entire project and could have
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
so i thank you um so i thought i
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
understood but maybe i don't understand
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
anymore because
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know i know that that electrical
 
01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.470 align:start position:0%
you know i know that that electrical
workers

01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
you know have a union and and
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.910 align:start position:0%
you know
those

01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
contractors i think we're talking about
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
the big contractors that that
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
subcontract most of their work
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
so those big contractors
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
which i think are what you represent
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't actually do they
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
actually have a contractors gen
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
i don't even know what to call them are
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
those the general contractors
 
01:47:47.679 --> 01:47:48.870 align:start position:0%
those the general contractors
or

01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a general contractor who
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
usually bids on the project
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
and he gets quotes from subcontractors
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
to do various portions
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
the general contractor may do portions
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the work themselves
 
01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.669 align:start position:0%
of the work themselves
so

01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
the the agreement the contract is signed
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
with the state agency
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
after they bid in there the low bidder
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
and they go through the executive
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
council process
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're the they're the one responsible
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
for the job
 
01:48:21.679 --> 01:48:23.189 align:start position:0%
for the job
follow-up

01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:24.709 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
now i'm wondering if this bill even
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody bids on a prod project it's
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
that big general i don't know if general
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
contractor is the correct term so
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
general contractor i mean it's not the
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
electricians that are bidding on it it's
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
the general contractor and and i'm think
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
that i think that you're saying that
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
that general contractors are
 
01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.590 align:start position:0%
that general contractors are
not

01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
if if you put a project labor agreement
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
on the project
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
the project labor agreement usually
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
requires everyone on that project to
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
follow those
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
individual rules that are placed in by
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
so it would apply to everyone on the job
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
right now you're absolutely right
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
some companies the plumber may be
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
unionized they or they may not be
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
but the contractor right now
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
selects those subcontractors
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
based on their qualifications are they
 
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.149 align:start position:0%
based on their qualifications are they
available

01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
workforce can they do it in time
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
those things are all handled by the
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
general contractor but it's the general
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
contractor who signs the agreement with
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
the state and puts up the bond and every
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
all the insurances to to complete the
 
01:49:42.639 --> 01:49:44.550 align:start position:0%
all the insurances to to complete the
project

01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm margaret burns
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
municipal it happens all the time the
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
worst one i've ever heard is biernez so
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
brian's i can handle yes it just burns

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.350 align:start position:0%
her brines
[Laughter]

01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
um good morning again i'm margaret burns
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire municipal
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
association and we are opposed to senate
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill 274 on a very narrow basis clearly
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation based on
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors testimony and
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that has come before me is to
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
apply this policy to state projects not
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
to municipal projects and in fact in the
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
senate the bill was amended to add some
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
language to the definition of
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
governmental entity on line 18 but it
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
does not apply to political subdivisions
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
however our concern remains with the
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
definition of government assisted in
 
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.830 align:start position:0%
definition of government assisted in
lines

01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
20-21 which does refer to any project
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
that receives a tax exemption tax
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
abatement or tax credit under rsa 72
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
section 80 through 83 rsa 79-e or rsa
 
01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.430 align:start position:0%
section 80 through 83 rsa 79-e or rsa
162-n

01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
162-n
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
specifically rsa 7280 and 79e are local
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
options for different types of local
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
projects as representative marsh and i
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
believe representative goalie have
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
already referenced
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
79e is the community revitalization tax
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
relief incentive program and rsa 7280
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
is the commercial and industrial
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
construction exemption and both of these
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
are local options so they would only be
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
local projects
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
my concern therefore is not only that
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
this bill could be applied to local
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
projects but that it also creates some
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
internal conflict in the statute does
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
the statute apply to local projects or
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
does it not and i think that's the issue
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
raised by keeping the
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
definition of government assisted
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
project as is to be clear nhma has no
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
position on whether or not
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities should enter into project
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
labor agreements our opposition is
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
simply based on the fact that
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities should be able to make
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
these policy decisions for themselves
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
about their own local projects um and
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
for that reason we are opposed to the
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions if i can
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative marsh
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you kindly
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
answer my question about the project in
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
manchester where they're currently
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
applying for 100 million dollars uh
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
which would include the advanced
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing regenerative institute
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
i believe the project fell under rsa
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
chapter 79e that you referenced and so
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
under the language of this statute it or
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
under the language of this bill it would
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
fall under a government assisted project
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
so i believe it would fall under the
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
parameters of this legislation
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:52:54.159 --> 01:52:55.109 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:55.119 --> 01:52:55.990 align:start position:0%
um

01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
bailey
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
i've heard we've heard from several
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
witnesses including you that this is a
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
problem because it binds the hands in
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
your case of the municipal people below
 
01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.550 align:start position:0%
your case of the municipal people below
us

01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:05.350 align:start position:0%
us
but

01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
isn't it also a problem that we are
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
being bound by the federal government
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
above us
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
i mean shouldn't it shouldn't it be like
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
we should have these
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
our position would be no not only should
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
we not have this bill at all levels we
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
should not have legislation that binds
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
the hands of municipalities either way
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear in the past nhma has also
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
opposed legislation to require the
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
payment of prevailing wages in local
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
construction projects because we believe
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
that municipalities should make those
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
local decisions at the local level
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's hawkinson
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't be allowed to read this
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
as long as you consistently blister
 
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.830 align:start position:0%
as long as you consistently blister
everybody

01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
consistently without doubt
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and you got my name correct
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
which is great it doesn't happen very
 
01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:07.669 align:start position:0%
which is great it doesn't happen very
often

01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm a first-timer as well so i
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for reading but uh i will be
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
doing that this morning
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%

01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
you can just you could just lower it
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
down to a little bit that would help and
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
that goes for everybody you kind of have
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%

council of carpenters very long name
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
i am proud to be here on behalf of our
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
union members more than 2
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
400 in new hampshire
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to speak in opposition of
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
sb 274.
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
first our union supports plas because
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
they benefit everyone on the
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
construction site from the developers to
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the contractors to the workers and to
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
our public work projects like you
 
01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.270 align:start position:0%
our public work projects like you
suggested

01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
all contractors union and non-union are
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
invited to bid
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
non-union contractors can be found on
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
pla projects pla's simply create a level
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
for all contractors because bids must
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
pay the same labor costs
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
this means the winning bidder
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
must demonstrate cost savings that truly
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
add value rather than simply paying
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
their workers less
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
secondly plas create jobs that provide
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
families sustaining wages training and
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
safe working conditions
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
sadly today rampant wage theft and
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
misclassification of workers in our
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
industry have driven down wages and
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
benefits as a result
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
a recent study has shown that more than
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
40 percent of construction workers 40
 
01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:24.950 align:start position:0%
40 percent of construction workers 40
percent

01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
nationwide must rely on some
 
01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.270 align:start position:0%
nationwide must rely on some
some

01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
sort of public assistance 40 percent
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
rely on public assistance
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
by using plas we know that the workers
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
on the job are paid fairly and they have
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
access to industry leading training like
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
the training that we can provide
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
at the carpenters training center in
 
01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:47.830 align:start position:0%
at the carpenters training center in
manchester

01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
this in turn benefits not only the
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
workers but also the state taxpayers
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
finally plas benefit contractors and
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
business owners
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
because they know that they have a level
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
playing field when they're going to bid
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
a job and they are successful that they
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
know that they have access to these
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
well-trained safe reliable workforce to
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that the projects are built on
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
time and on budget like we've heard
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i urge you
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
to vote against sb 274. thank you
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're willing to
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%

would it be fair to say that
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
the workers that would work for these
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
committee

01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
i i rise uh to speak against this bill
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
as someone who's been in the contracting
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
business since i was 15
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that one it's not
 
01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:34.629 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that one it's not
necessary

01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
and two all it does is encourages the
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
cheaters to find more loopholes
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
in all my years in the in the business
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
and by the way i'm 68
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
um it's been a long time i can tell you
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
that when when you decide that you're
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
not going to have any kind of a pla on a
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
big job
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
all you get
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
is the people who aren't paying workers
 
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.270 align:start position:0%
is the people who aren't paying workers
comp

01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
comp
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
are aren't paying their people the going
 
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.229 align:start position:0%
are aren't paying their people the going
rate

01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
i was on a job recently where i noticed
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
some of the roofers weren't eating lunch
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
i needed an interpreter to ask him why
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have his green card so they were
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
paying him seven dollars an hour
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
i've also been on jobs where they do
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
have their green card but they're so
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
afraid to say anything
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
and you find out they're not getting the
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
35 an hour that the rest of the guys are
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
getting to do that roof
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
and and what did we do
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
on my job i threw them out
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
not the guys that didn't have green
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
cards but the contractor because that's
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
not the way we do things we we require
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
that you pay your people
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
that anybody who's working there has to
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
be legitimate
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
and that nobody's abused we right now
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
have jobs going on in the state of new
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire large jobs paid for with
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
where the contractors come from either
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
vermont or maine where the workers comp
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
is cheaper
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
they don't follow our rules here which
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
says you can only work three days here
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
before you have to have a new hampshire
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
workers comp they just keep saying oh
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
well i left and i came back
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
because their rates are so much cheaper
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
than ours so basically the idea that
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to save some of the new
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire contractors is a fallacy
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're not saving anybody because right
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
now we're allowing the abuse
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
and it's every single day
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
as i said we
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
in our company pay workers comp we
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
follow the labor laws
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and we have safety requirements and
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
everybody is our employee
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
you're right when somebody asks the
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
question how easy is it to make
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
everybody a subcontractor it's very easy
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
all you'd say to them is here's what you
 
02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.149 align:start position:0%
all you'd say to them is here's what you
get

02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
and you know the worst part about that
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
is those guys don't know enough to save
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
enough money to pay their taxes that
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
they owe so at the end of the year
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're looking for their unemployment
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
tax and everything else they didn't make
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
any money
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
in fact on one case where i tried to
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
help somebody when they finally paid
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
their taxes and everything else that the
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
state came after them for
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
they actually made five dollars and 75
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
cents an hour
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
not even minimum wage but what they were
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
offered looked really good
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
until they got caught
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
so i'd ask you to not bother passing
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
this bill it's not necessary
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
and and to say that a state can't have a
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement it just says
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
here's what you have to follow here's
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
everybody has to be paid right they have
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
to have their workers comp
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
you have to have their fighter food or
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
suitor all that all that stuff has to
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
come out
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
and you can't make them
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
a subcontractor because it's cheaper
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
as i said i've been doing this a long
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
time and probably one of the few people
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
in this room who have actually run very
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
large jobs
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
and had both union and non-union people
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
working side by side
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
but on my jobs everybody's paid the same
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
so the only arguments we ever got into
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
is who was the better craftsman
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
and i appreciated that because that
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
meant that everybody was trying to outdo
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
the other to be even better
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
to take away the pla's on my right to
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a pla
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
is to take away the idea that
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to have a fair
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity and every contractor can
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually bid
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're not going to be
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
outbid by the guy who cheats on a
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
regular basis thank you madam chair i'll
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's not my first time representative
 
02:02:31.599 --> 02:02:33.669 align:start position:0%
it's not my first time representative
goalie

02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
being around long enough
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.629 align:start position:0%
we hear
plas

02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
plas
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
could be increased costs on a project up
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
to 15 percent somewhere in that range
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
in being around in construction business
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
long enough does
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
a low bid
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
always mean
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
a quality project quality
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
completed project
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
if somebody's 15 less
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
typically what happened is they've
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
they've forgotten something or they have
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
a plan on not doing something and if you
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to talk about asphalt instead of
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
three inches you're going to get two and
 
02:03:15.679 --> 02:03:16.709 align:start position:0%
three inches you're going to get two and
a half

02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
a half
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
um there's all kinds of ways of cheating
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
and and cheap it's not always the best
 
02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.350 align:start position:0%
and and cheap it's not always the best
bid

02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative fought now
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just for the
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
record could you
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
state what your name is and either what
 
02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:33.910 align:start position:0%
state what your name is and either what
company

02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
you represent my name is robert clegg
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
i live in hudson new hampshire
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm actually here speaking for
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
myself and some of the companies that
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
i'm a partner in
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
mr clegg
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't require plas it just
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
leaves that up to
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bidding process so i'm not sure
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
your position is that
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be prohibited but they
 
02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.790 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be prohibited but they
aren't

02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill will will entice
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
people to prohibit them
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
in order to take the lowest bid
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's typical when you get federal money
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is a good example
 
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
when the federal money rolls in and you
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
bid on work in massachusetts
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
is basically what i would call a pla
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
everybody has to pay
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
some people know it as bacon davis act
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire contractors are allowed
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
to go into mass but but you have to pay
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
the going rate and and you have to treat
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
your people the same
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
i honestly believe that the intent of
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is to
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
ice out anybody who or
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
keep out anybody who has
 
02:04:47.119 --> 02:04:48.709 align:start position:0%
keep out anybody who has
um

02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
decent wages
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
whether they're union or non-union
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
um if if i'm going to go in a bid
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
against people who are allowed to have
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
an entire force of subcontractors with
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
no workers comp no insurances
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to bother bidding so i
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
think that what happens when you put
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
something like this out there you say to
 
02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
people don't bother
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
to bid here go to work in mass or
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
someplace else um we'll we'll take the
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
cheap labor it's it's a problem because
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
i believe the quality of the work goes
 
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.189 align:start position:0%
i believe the quality of the work goes
down

02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
when you say you don't have to be a
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
morning bob
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the statement was made in response to
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
a question that i asked of an earlier
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
individual who referenced the fact that
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
is in effect in about 20 other states
 
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i said do they have any experience
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
with the bills or is it in
 
02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
these agreements in pla these
 
02:05:54.079 --> 02:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
these agreements in pla these
legislation

02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
bills are they in effect in other states
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can say
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
with some degree of a certain certitude
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the bill works
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
the legislation works and he said
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
that they don't have any he was not
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
aware of any of them having any problems
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any experience with other
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
states that have this type of
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation in place
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
every state i've done work for has has
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
basically what i would call pla
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
requirements you you can't bid on on a
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
project with them without following
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
certain criteria
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
and you might as well say it's it's it's
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
almost like being part of the union but
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know before you go in what the
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
criteria is
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
so instead of waiting for somebody to
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
come in and he says well you didn't tell
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
me i had to have liability insurance on
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
everybody or you didn't have to tell you
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
didn't tell me how to have workers comp
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
whether they're subcontractors
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
at that point it's too late you're
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
already the low bidder and if you've got
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
the job who's who's responsible for that
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's the state who's had to pick up the
 
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
it's the state who's had to pick up the
difference

02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't know about other states i
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
only know the the new england states
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think we still call new york or new
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
england state but
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i've worked in hartford connecticut
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
having a pla of some sort and i'm not
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
saying a union peeler having a pla to
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
work off of makes it so much easier
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
to be competitive
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.719 --> 02:07:32.310 align:start position:0%

senate bill 274

the bill that would essentially
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
allow out of state workers to overtake
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
any publicly funded capital improvement
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%

and i'll read
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
my personal experience of pla provide me
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
with a stock reminder of the value of
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
keeping our locals working
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
over 12 years ago when walmart came to
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
gorham to erect a superstore there
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
the contractor brought laborers not only
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
from out of state but from out of
 
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
country there were some arrests for
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
being in the country illegally
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
while not one single laborer from the
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
berlin gorham area was hired to do the
 
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.109 align:start position:0%
berlin gorham area was hired to do the
work

02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
three years later bell heary a non-pla
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
contractor was awarded the contract to
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill fci berlin
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
though bell hirey did hire many locals
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
most of the workforce was from outside
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
coast county
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
they provided work for many but did not
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
offer young people a chance to learn a
 
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.229 align:start position:0%
offer young people a chance to learn a
trade

02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%

02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
the following year babcock and wilcox
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
with a pla signed
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
with a developer of burgess biopower
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
built the 75 megawatt power plant
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the labor force was
 
02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
from coast county
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
and as part of a structured agreement
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
between k street capital
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
and myself with the city of berlin
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
the different building trades all
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
started apprenticeship programs
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
many of the 18 to 25 year olds with
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
little construction backgrounds but a
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
motivated willingness to learn a
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
lifelong skill
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
were hired by the union halls
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
it is a success story for these young
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
productive adults
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
a chance that they more likely would not
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
have been given if not for the new
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire building trades crafts
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill 274 was written without
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
consulting federal government agencies
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that hold the power to assist new
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%

bridges
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
it was written without consideration for
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
its potential impact on towns and cities
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%

02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
and was clearly written as a solution in
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
search of a problem as new hampshire has
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
never in its entire history
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
had a project labor agreement on
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
state-funded construction projects
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of berlin in the north country
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
i ask you to please kill sb 274
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
a short-sighted bill that would impede
 
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
our state's ability to receive millions
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
of dollars in federal infrastructure

02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
and if pass
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
will only fill the pockets of a few big
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
shark contractors at the expense of our
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
great new hampshire skilled craftsmen
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%

paragraph there about the federal
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
agencies uh are you essentially
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
answering my question to senator bradley
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
as to whether this bill would make it
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
impossible for the new hampshire to
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
access the competitive grants to the
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
department of transportation i think the
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written the language is
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
so nebulous that we're going to be
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
feeding lawyers and not paying
 
02:12:19.679 --> 02:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
feeding lawyers and not paying
contractors

02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
it makes zero sense to me
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you know we're trying to fix a
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
in hearing your testimony on the last
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
few paragraphs
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding and your
 
02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.550 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding and your
experience

02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier testimony that this
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill before us would protect new
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire workers and companies
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like apla protected the
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
north country workers and companies is
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
that not correct well i don't want to
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
wait in the waters of speculation all i
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
can talk about is my experience
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
when babcock and wilcox came to berlin i
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
sat down
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
with babcock and wilcox and then joe
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%

trades council
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
and we worked out an agreement where the
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
billing trades would hire
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
a bunch of
 
02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
a bunch of
young

02:13:19.750 --> 02:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
young
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
berlin gorham residents to learn trades
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
and there were approximately a hundred
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
new people learning a trade and all the
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
various trades on that three-year
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
construction project
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%

berlin they are living they're working
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
jobs that have a livable wage they're
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
productive members of berlin and without
 
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
that project they probably would have
 
02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.629 align:start position:0%
that project they probably would have
left

02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%

delivering those construction services
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
are not conducive to our company's ways

when there are project labor agreements
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
you've essentially
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
mandated that my company will be not
 
02:17:18.639 --> 02:17:19.910 align:start position:0%
mandated that my company will be not
afforded

02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
afforded
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
to bid on the project
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
our 175 employees and let's say their
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
two dependents
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
would make up 525 people that would be
 
02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.230 align:start position:0%
would make up 525 people that would be
affected

02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
affected
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
by not having the opportunity to even
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
bid on a job
 
02:17:46.469 --> 02:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
we've had experience uh with project
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
labor agreement opposition in the past
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
there was a job course center that was
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
federal in in manchester years ago
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
fortunately the project did not go with
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
a pla had it gone with a pla at the time
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
we would not have participated
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
the project ended up getting built
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
without a pla and my company was
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
successful bitter
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
to design furnish and install the fire
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
protection system
 
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
so if plas are to be
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
put forward in a meaningful way
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire fire protection will not
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
participate and the state
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
would not be afforded
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%

small businesses in new hampshire
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
don't favor plas

and i wanted to ask you
 
02:18:57.439 --> 02:18:59.349 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to ask you
why

02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
you would not bid on a project with a
 
02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:04.709 align:start position:0%
you would not bid on a project with a

um
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm not expert in this but i'm trying
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
to understand why you think
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to participate
 
02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to participate
because

02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you have good benefits and
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
do do you use
 
02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:47.670 align:start position:0%
do do you use
subcontractors

02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
we self-employ
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
our labor they're genuine employees of
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
our company they're they're not
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
from a union hall
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
they are direct employees of hampshire
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
fire protection
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:21:07.270 --> 02:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
we are a merit shop company we are not a
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
union shop company and and therefore a
 
02:21:10.319 --> 02:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
union shop company and and therefore a

02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.030 align:start position:0%

affiliations that would cause us to have
to

02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.590 align:start position:0%

02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
essentially union is a non-starter for
 
02:21:22.479 --> 02:21:23.750 align:start position:0%
essentially union is a non-starter for
us

02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
us
follow-up

02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
follow-up
up

02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
up
so

02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
maybe i don't understand but
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
um what i had been hearing
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
is that these agreements don't necess
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't make you
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
don't require
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
at least in some cases to hire union
 
02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
at least in some cases to hire union
employees

02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
they have provisions that say like you
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay the prevailing wage
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
you know and and you can't use you know
 
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
you can't use
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
you can't use sub contractors people who
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
are really
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
just employees but some people call them
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
subcontractors so they don't have to do
 
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
the workers comp and don't have to give
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
them benefits so i'm i'm not entirely
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
are you sure that this you would be
 
02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
are you sure that this you would be
excluded

02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
from you from being a subcontract i mean
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
you're not going to bid on these
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
projects anyway these are big
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
representatives please don't please
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
don't debate the witness just ask ask
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
your question and let him answer i am
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to because my understanding
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
is that this is not
 
02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
is that this is not
for

02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
just like a retro fit that you might be
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
doing for a building but that these are
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
big construction projects and your
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
we are a specialty contractor and we do
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
work with prime contractors or
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
construction managers who would execute
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
that prime contract
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh say with with the the owner or the
 
02:22:50.479 --> 02:22:53.349 align:start position:0%
uh say with with the the owner or the
state

02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
our employees are truly our employees
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
with with full benefits we pay all of
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
our workers comp we
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
we apply all the requirements
 
02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:08.309 align:start position:0%
we apply all the requirements
for

02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
proper classification of employees and
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
wages it's not
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
to be that we are less than
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's that the
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements are such that
 
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements are such that
the

02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
rules and the necessity to adhere to
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
union labor type rules
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
aren't ones that we in the merit shop
 
02:23:34.479 --> 02:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
aren't ones that we in the merit shop
community

02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
um adhere to and if there's a
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
pla those rules would be in effect in in
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's incongruous with with who we are
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
as merit shop contractors

02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
if there was a pla
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
your choice to bid on the con bit not
 
02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
bid on the contract is your choice
 
02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
bid on the contract is your choice
that

02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't preclude you from bidding on
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the contract just because it is a pla
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's your choice not to bid is that
 
02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:14.230 align:start position:0%
it's your choice not to bid is that
correct

02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's correct we would choose not to
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
bid on a pla project
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
based on the union work rules that would
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
be in effect and in so doing
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's a special carve out for that
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
type of labor versus say 90 percent of
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
construction work
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
that is merit shop
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
i i will be denied or my employees and
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
their dependents will be denied
 
02:25:40.399 --> 02:25:42.070 align:start position:0%
their dependents will be denied
opportunity

02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
if a pla
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so just to confirm
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
if if this bill didn't pass and a pla
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
were instituted on a job you're saying
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
your firm would be denied the right to
 
02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
your firm would be denied the right to
bid

02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
bid
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's not my my my right to bid it is my
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
choice okay because
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
i can't i am i will not be subjected to
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
the union uh uh project labor
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
arrangements or or rules that are in
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
effect based on the pla these these are
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
these are onerous rules
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
that that i am
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
not going to be adhering to and i don't
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
adhere to them in the private sector
 
02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
adhere to them in the private sector
currently

02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
follow up i just i just wanted to
 
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
confirm because i keep hearing
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
precluded from bidding denied
 
02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.270 align:start position:0%
precluded from bidding denied
bidding

02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
bidding
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
and and i'm just trying to find out if
 
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's the case you will be you won't
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
you won't be allowed i believe that the
 
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the witnesses answered that
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
question i think three three times thank
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
i i have not seen a pla
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
are you requi
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
how involved how involved is it
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're deputized to be in
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
the union or have to follow all of their
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
rules is it that extensive i think it
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
would appear that it's
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
you've got to do reasonable things
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
follow osha follow workman's
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
compensation uh
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
wages are specified but beyond that
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
is there do all the work rules come with
 
02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.670 align:start position:0%
is there do all the work rules come with
this

02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
is that your objection i don't quite see
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
why it's so
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
burdensome for you
 
02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
burdensome for you
we

02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
we abide by all the rules already so it
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
the the pla isn't going to uh cause us
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
to do something uh that we're not
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
already doing already
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
besides the union requirements that the
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
finer points of the language and the
 
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
agreement would uh
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
pertain to
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
would have us have to be beholden to
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
other decision makers who are providing
 
02:28:21.309 --> 02:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
those work rules that are
 
02:28:21.319 --> 02:28:23.110 align:start position:0%
those work rules that are
union-driven

02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
union-driven
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
work rules
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
and we are a merit shop company and and
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be subjected to
 
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be subjected to
those

02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you madam
 
02:28:42.070 --> 02:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
chair i will be brief uh thank you sir
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question it sounds like
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
you're a good businessman and uh you
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a very successful business i am
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
aware of it but if this bill gets
 
02:28:51.439 --> 02:28:53.429 align:start position:0%
aware of it but if this bill gets
defeated

02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
you still would have a very successful
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's likely i will continue to be
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
successful i i don't like the notion of
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
a special carve out
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
in denying my company and my employees
 
02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:11.670 align:start position:0%
in denying my company and my employees
opportunity

02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
um you know if i'm doing business now
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
um i would like the opportunity to do
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
business on the next big project that's
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
involved with the state
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
and not have it be that we're going to
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
have to pass
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
because of a pla
 
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
you've essentially tied my hands
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
when it becomes a pla and even if i am
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
say a dominant fire sprinkler company
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
the state's not going to have the
 
02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:41.190 align:start position:0%
the state's not going to have the
benefit

02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll leave that thank you
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%

02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh this was a period of time
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
we had you know quite a bit of
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
construction at the time we had about 30
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
000 construction workers
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
the construction industry was growing
 
02:31:53.439 --> 02:31:54.309 align:start position:0%
the construction industry was growing
um

02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:54.319 --> 02:31:55.270 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know we were looking forward to um
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know proven
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
proving that uh a project labor
 
02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:02.710 align:start position:0%
proving that uh a project labor
agreement

02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
on a
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh government
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
construction job uh would be beneficial
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
and to the workforce here in the state
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.950 --> 02:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
under

02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
we had already had a series of
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
procurement new hampshire state
 
02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:26.230 align:start position:0%
procurement new hampshire state
procurement

02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
bills that were put forward
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire to
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
try to address a lot of the concerns
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we spoke about that was spoken
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
and senator clegg
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
was on that was on that committee
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and opposed to the building trades
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
and where we were on a lot of these
 
02:32:44.319 --> 02:32:45.990 align:start position:0%
and where we were on a lot of these
issues

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
it was during those hearings that a lot
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
of this information came out
 
02:32:50.479 --> 02:32:51.429 align:start position:0%
of this information came out
about

02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
how construction workers were being
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
treated on job sites all throughout the
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire now obviously we
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of great contractors that are
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
non-union in the state of new hampshire
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of great contractors that
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
are union
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
but we also have a lot that um
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
take advantage of their workforce and
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
that was the basis of the project labor
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
agreement that we were working on
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
to try to prove that it would have been
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
a benefit with the worker in the state
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
where workers
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
would have had representation they would
 
02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
have they would have made
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
the wages
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
for their craft that they were supposed
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
in all of that
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:36.469 align:start position:0%
and uh
after

02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
the challenge went through
 
02:33:38.319 --> 02:33:39.429 align:start position:0%
the challenge went through
um

02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
they uh they took away the project labor
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
agreement job was re-bid
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
contractor got the job
 
02:33:45.359 --> 02:33:46.469 align:start position:0%
contractor got the job
um

02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it was essentially a 100 non-union
 
02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:50.710 align:start position:0%
and it was essentially a 100 non-union
project

02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
that was taken place
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we lost the
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement when we were
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
trying we were trying to um
 
02:33:59.040 --> 02:33:59.910 align:start position:0%
trying we were trying to um
uh

02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know make a point and show
 
02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:04.150 align:start position:0%
you know make a point and show
how

02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
the young worker in the state of new
 
02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:07.750 align:start position:0%

02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:09.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire
uh

02:34:09.270 --> 02:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
was not interested becoming interested
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
in the in the industry anymore
 
02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
in the in the industry anymore
um

02:34:16.389 --> 02:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
we followed the project by
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
the freedom
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
information act in pulling the payroll
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
from the job so that we can make sure
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
that although the job was not under a
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
all of the employers were still subject
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
to have to pay
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
the davis bacon rates because it was a
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
federally funded project
 
02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:38.630 align:start position:0%
federally funded project
and

02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
the first couple of months they did
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then about the third month
 
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
um we noticed that
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
some of the trades most
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh most significantly the trades that
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
were working on the civil portion of the
 
02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:54.469 align:start position:0%
were working on the civil portion of the
project

02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're now making about five six dollars
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
an hour less than that they were making
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
the previous month
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
i contacted the department of labor or
 
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
the u.s department of labor
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
and asked what the deal was with that
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
the winning contractor for the for the
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
project had solicited the department of
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
labor for a new davis bacon rate
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
which was significantly less the job was
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
bid under building our contractors
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
bidded under building
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they changed it to the heavy
 
02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:27.429 align:start position:0%
and they changed it to the heavy
category

02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
category
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
which allowed the employer to now cut
 
02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
which allowed the employer to now cut
wages

02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
wages
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh in some cases up to six dollars an
 
02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
uh in some cases up to six dollars an
hour

02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
this was in 2009
 
02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:42.950 align:start position:0%
this was in 2009
[Music]

02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
by the time the project had started
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
the world in construction had fallen
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
apart at that point
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
we were down about 12 000 workers in the
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
because of the crisis in the economy
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
and these people just basically didn't
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
have any other place to go
 
02:36:01.439 --> 02:36:02.630 align:start position:0%
have any other place to go
and

02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:03.510 align:start position:0%
and
that

02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
what this project labor agreement was
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to was supposed to stop and
 
02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:10.710 align:start position:0%
supposed to was supposed to stop and
prove

02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
prove
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
decision

02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
i in the building trades we appealed the
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
decision by the department of labor and
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
well after the project was complete
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
the department of labor said that they
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
did air in making that decision and they
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
should never have allowed that to happen
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
the poster child project
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
that is cited as far as
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
as far as um
 
02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
why we should not have project labor
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
agreements and what have you here in the
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the very project turned out to be a
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
disgrace for the worker
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
now these are the young workers right
 
02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
now these are the young workers right
who

02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
our dads
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
and uh grandfathers
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
that we expect to send
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
their kids and their grandkid children
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
into the trades
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
and will now wonder why we can't find
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
any help
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state from the workforce
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
and why nobody wants to come into the
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
trades it's the last place you're going
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
to see people like that sending their
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
kids including me
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh and i'll tell you it's uh
 
02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:21.670 align:start position:0%
um and uh and i'll tell you it's uh
it's

02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:37:24.150 --> 02:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're in a real world of hurt as far as
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
bringing trying to bring in uh
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
young kids young workers or those that
 
02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
worked in the trade
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
half of the half of the construction
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
workers that are worth anything in the
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire right now
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
and we're wondering where they are and
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
why they're not working on new hampshire
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
projects across from the border and
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
working in massachusetts they didn't
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity before they do now
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
now project labor agreement's not going
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
to solve all our pro
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
all our problems
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
but there's a reason why we have lost a
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
lot of workers and we continue to do so
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
and if we really want to um
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
start looking at how we're going to
 
02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:02.469 align:start position:0%
start looking at how we're going to
increase

02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
the young kids
 
02:38:05.359 --> 02:38:06.230 align:start position:0%
the young kids
and

02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
want them to come into the trades
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
these are some of the tools that we can
 
02:38:10.479 --> 02:38:11.590 align:start position:0%
these are some of the tools that we can
use

02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
if we show choose to do so if not we
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to it's just a tool taking it
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
and just you know cable
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
no municipality anybody that has state
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
funding on on a project
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
will not be able to do so uh is just
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
ridiculous considering the fact
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
that i can't see it happening
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
it has never happened
 
02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
it has never happened
and

02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know it probably won't
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
but if a municipality certainly wanted
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
to use that tool
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
to put some people in their high school
 
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
to work on a project
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
if any shape or form any work force
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
agreement in any shape or form
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
would now be illegal and that's exactly
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
what how this is worded
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it's wrong
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
and uh that concludes my testimony thank
 
02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:04.870 align:start position:0%
and uh that concludes my testimony thank
you

02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
but this hearing has run into two other
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
bills which i'm going to reschedule for
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
the afternoon so we can fin we will
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
finish up the hearing here and then go
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
to lunch and do the other two bills of
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and i apologize to all of
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%

uh
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
for scheduling this ceiling actually
 
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.110 align:start position:0%
for scheduling this ceiling actually
um

02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%

02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
the chair calls
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
josh reap
 
02:40:26.030 --> 02:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and i want to be i want to be
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
sensitive to people's time and thank you
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak today uh in lieu of
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
my written testimony which is being
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
passed out i just wanted to
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
hit on a couple of uh points that are in
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
my written testimony because i think
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're germaine and relate a lot to the
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions and conversations been
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
happening so i'll stick mostly to that
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh my name for the record is joshua
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
reeve i'm from manchester new hampshire
 
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
but i represent associate builders and
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
contractors which is based in concord
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
we represent over 260 merit shop or open
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
shop contractors here in new hampshire
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
and a few in vermont
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
but ultimately our contractors uh
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
do bid private public work every day
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
and they provide a lot of good quality
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
construction you see even here in this
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
building and next door in the capitol
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
and across the entire campus here
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
throughout concord
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
um ultimately for us
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements it should be
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
left up to the contractor because it's
 
02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
one of those work rule tools that are
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
utilized by contractors if they choose
 
02:41:38.080 --> 02:41:39.190 align:start position:0%
utilized by contractors if they choose
to

02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion earlier about
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
what the state requires you don't need a
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
pla to guarantee workers comp if someone
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
is a citizen if someone's got insurance
 
02:41:49.030 --> 02:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
and bonding all that's established by
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
state law already
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
so if there's a general contractor
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
around here that chooses someone on to
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
as a roofer
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
for their sub as a roofer that is
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
employable illegal illegal
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
workers i question that general
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
contractors work ethic but in general
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
our contractors don't do that they are
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
pre-vetted by the state they are high
 
02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
quality high performing contractors
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
and for us just in general
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out the fact that
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're having this conversation today
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's very passion on both sides
 
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
shows you that this legislation is very
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
necessary because there's a lot of talk
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
out of the beltway in politics in dc
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
about implementing mandates in a variety
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
of parts of life including in
 
02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
construction with a pla mandate now
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
again if a contractor chooses to use a
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
pla that works well for them
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
but let me tell you the problems when
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
you have a government mandated pla and
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
why we need this bill to prevent them
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
from ever happening
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
they are effectively a one size fits all
 
02:42:42.309 --> 02:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
and when a general contractor is told by
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
the state you have to divide by this pla
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
and all your subs have to abide by all
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
the work rules in there too it throws
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
out any kind of collective bargaining
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
agreement those subs had or any
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
relationship they had with their
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
employees and that's the problem when
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
the government mandates a pla
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
it also removes certain efficiencies
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
that a contractor may have with their
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
workforce a guy here from this hampshire
 
02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
fire talked about his merit workforce he
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
directly employs his individuals and
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
they work out what the work rules look
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
like in processes when you jumble in a
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
pla from the government the government
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
says here's one size fits all you need
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
to work within that scope they go what
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
the hell i can't work with that because
 
02:43:18.479 --> 02:43:19.429 align:start position:0%
the hell i can't work with that because
we

02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar with those broke rules
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
it may work for some contractors but not
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
it removes
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
pathways into construction now the sure
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
pla can include them but it limits which
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
ones they are under a project labor
 
02:43:33.429 --> 02:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
agreement an open shop contractor with
 
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
an apprentice program
 
02:43:36.150 --> 02:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
can't use their apprentices on the
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
project it eliminates that pathway into
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
into the careers in construction because
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
what happens is the pla says you have to
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
use an apprentice program recognized by
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
the local union hall that's fine for a
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
union contractor because that's where
 
02:43:50.309 --> 02:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
they borrow their labor from but for a
 
02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
merit shop or open shop contractor
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
when you're told you can't use your
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
apprentices on a project or you can't
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
use your apprentice program on the
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
project what's the point of even having
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
one anymore because that closes the door
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
of opportunity for craft workers in the
 
02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:04.630 align:start position:0%
of opportunity for craft workers in the
state

02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
there's also something i want to mention
 
02:44:06.479 --> 02:44:07.510 align:start position:0%
there's also something i want to mention
too

02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know the benefits right there's a
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
question earlier to someone about
 
02:44:13.190 --> 02:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges of why you
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to bid a government
 
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
mandated pla project it's very simple
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
under a project labor agreement when
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's mandated by the government
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
it says where the benefits go the
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
benefits has to go through the union
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
hall now if i'm an open shop or
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
non-union contractor and i bid on a job
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
the government says i have to use a cba
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
or collect collective bargaining
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
agreement under a pla
 
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
all that benefit package goes through
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
the union hall my worker is not going to
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
be on that job long enough to meet the
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
investment requirements of that union's
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
program so what happens is an open shop
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
contractor i'm paying double benefits
 
02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm paying to a union hall for the
 
02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
privilege of working on this public work
 
02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:49.910 align:start position:0%
privilege of working on this public work
project

02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm paying my worker separately for
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
their 401k
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
their healthcare and their apprentice
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
fund separately because that's what a
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
good employer would do that's an example
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
of some of the increased costs that come
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
when you have a government mandated pla
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
and ultimately at the end of the day
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is about just making sure that
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire as government we don't
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
start putting in requirements that
 
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
aren't necessary there's some talk
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
earlier about some of the investment
 
02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
recovery funds that are coming from the
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
federal government so let's say a state
 
02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
agency applies for it in that grant
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
language it talks about having local
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
labor local hire and local
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
project labor agreement discussions with
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
local labor you could still do all that
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
under this bill the very last portion
 
02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
talks about exemptions all it says is if
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
you still want to do a pla you got to
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing if you're going to
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
talk about a pla which amends state
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
contract laws in a completely different
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
way and foreign to new hampshire you got
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
to at least have conversations so
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
situations like this like you have today
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
you have the diverse opinions that come
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
into factoring whether or not that works
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the local workforce and the local
 
02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:51.750 align:start position:0%
for the local workforce and the local
contractors

02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately what that's about on
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
the end of it the exemptions on that
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the other points i want to
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
make on the bill the reason why there
 
02:46:00.309 --> 02:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
are some references to those rsas
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
is because we want to make sure that if
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
if a municipality goes to the state and
 
02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
says we want this carve out please give
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
it to us there's not going to be some
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
state agency bad actor is going to say
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
well you got to do it my way you got to
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
do it with a pla or without a pla it's
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
your choice by the way because that's
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately what the rest of the bill
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
says on here so the bill as it says is
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
it merits now if the state is a direct
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
a direct
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
contract holder on this that project
 
02:46:25.830 --> 02:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
won't have a mandated pla but if a
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
municipality or someone else wants to
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
get an exemption for something it's just
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
saying the state won't mandate that they
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
have a pla on it
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
so um i know that we've been here for a
 
02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
while and you know i'm happy answering
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions i hope i clear
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
clarified some that may already be out
 
02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:40.870 align:start position:0%
clarified some that may already be out
there

02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
nice job thank you very much
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative lucas
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you it appears there weren't
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
enough copies your written test wanted
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
to go around possible please email it to
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
the committee absolutely i'll do that by
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
end today thank you thank you thank you
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
before i call the the next witness to
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
testify i would ask that
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
please keep your testimony to
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
information that the committee has not
 
02:47:08.950 --> 02:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
already heard from a prior witness
 
02:47:11.349 --> 02:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
if you believe that you're going to just
 
02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
kind of regurgitate the same thing we've
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
already heard if you could just um
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
please wave off that would be fantastic
 
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:16.790 align:start position:0%
please wave off that would be fantastic
um

02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:18.230 align:start position:0%
um

02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee i appreciate the opportunity
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
to speak with you today
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
my name is john gilbert i'm the
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
president of martino electric we're an
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
electrical contractor in dover we have
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
25 employees and the company is 100
 
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
employee owned through an employee stock
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
ownership plan
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
briefly we employ local people we pay
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
competitive wages we offer excellent
 
02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
benefits and we train our people
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
thoroughly and carefully and we have a
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
very strong focus on safety
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
mandated plas would introduce a number
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
of unknowns into our efforts to provide
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective results for our
 
02:48:07.359 --> 02:48:08.469 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective results for our
customers

02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
it would force us to introduce
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
inequities into our compensation
 
02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:13.030 align:start position:0%
inequities into our compensation
programs

02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:48:14.950 --> 02:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
and our management program internally by
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
bringing in union workers that are paid
 
02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
and managed differently than our
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
employees inducing
 
02:48:22.469 --> 02:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
harmful stresses within within the
 
02:48:22.479 --> 02:48:25.030 align:start position:0%
harmful stresses within within the
organization

02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
in addition outside workers that we have
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
not developed trained and worked with
 
02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
would be a wild card for us with respect
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
to quality productivity and possibly
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
safety we simply would not know them the
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
way that we know our own people
 
02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
our costs would therefore be higher to
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
hedge against uncertainty which is
 
02:48:46.230 --> 02:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
inefficient for the customer
 
02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
this uncertainty i would note adds
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
substantially to the considerable
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
uncertainty we already face with the
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
availability and costs of construction
 
02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:56.630 align:start position:0%
availability and costs of construction
materials

02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
materials
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
our people care very deeply
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
about the quality of their work the
 
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
customers the company and they have
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
chosen to work in a merit-based model
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
because of their desire to do great work
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as possible
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
we believe that plas are not aligned
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
with that model
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
we are confident that the business
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
leaders and owners in our industry are
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the best position to decide the right
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
model for their businesses without
 
02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
government involvement influencing labor
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
management practices
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request that you support
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%

thank you very much are there any
questions

02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions

representative goalie
 
02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
has

02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
the way the current law is written now
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
prevented you from
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
as the as as
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
currently this this law is not in place
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
so in the absence of this law no we have
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
not been prevented from from bidding on
 
02:50:09.279 --> 02:50:13.110 align:start position:0%
not been prevented from from bidding on
contracts

02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:14.550 --> 02:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
would this law prevent you from being
 
02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:15.670 align:start position:0%
would this law prevent you from being
follow-up

02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:19.429 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes we would be disinclined for the very
 
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasons that you heard from the
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the sprinkler company
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
it'd be the same same issue you know we
 
02:50:27.279 --> 02:50:28.469 align:start position:0%
it'd be the same same issue you know we
have

02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
established internal management
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
practices and procedures we would be
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
required to bring some in that do not
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
comport with the ones that we have
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
chosen to use
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be a factor in deciding
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
whether we were going to bid on the
 
02:50:45.429 --> 02:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
project or not one last follow-up
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that decision on whether or not you
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
bid on the contract isn't because it's a
 
02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
pla it's a business decision on your
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
behalf correct it's a business decision
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman

members of the committee i will keep my
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
comments short

annually
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh we are a merit-based shop and you go
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
on to our website you'll be very clear
 
02:51:48.389 --> 02:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
to notice is a team effort
 
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
the entire company works together as a
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
team we go on a job site each crew is a
 
02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:55.110 align:start position:0%
team we go on a job site each crew is a
team

02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
team
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to use one quick example
 
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
as to how that differs
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
from other organizations
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to use the example of a
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
steel reinforced concrete retaining wall
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
we go on site the team crew chief
 
02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
has his members
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
they form the footing
 
02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
pour the concrete
 
02:52:19.910 --> 02:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
tie the rebar
 
02:52:22.230 --> 02:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
put the
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
reinforcing panels in place pour the
 
02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:26.070 align:start position:0%
reinforcing panels in place pour the
concrete

02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
strip the wall and begin the backfill
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
process they do that as the team
 
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
together the same crew
 
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
under other scenarios
 
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
you would look at the carpenters union
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
to come in to form the footing
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
the steel workers to do the rebar in the
 
02:52:42.479 --> 02:52:45.110 align:start position:0%
the steel workers to do the rebar in the
reinforcing

02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
reinforcing
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
the labor crew to to help pour the
 
02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:49.429 align:start position:0%
the labor crew to to help pour the
concrete

02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
02:52:52.309 --> 02:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
the carpets to push and pieces in place
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
pour the concrete with the concrete
 
02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:55.110 align:start position:0%
pour the concrete with the concrete
laborers

02:52:55.110 --> 02:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
laborers
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
carpenters come back to strip that and
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
then another crew comes in to do the
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
earth work
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
essentially the same product at the end
 
02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
but clearly you can see that the
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and efficiency
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be less
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
so our model of our merit-based model
 
02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
working truly as a team throughout the
 
02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
company is what we believe makes us
 
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
different and has kept us a successful
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um i understand the steps that
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
you just went went through it sounds
 
02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
sounds a lot like um putting down
 
02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
putting in the foundation for a house
 
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
so do you um have a lot of jobs that are
 
02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:36.710 align:start position:0%
so do you um have a lot of jobs that are
on

02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
big projects like 20 like 30 million
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
dollar projects or do you do more
 
02:53:45.269 --> 02:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
like residential kinds of things most of
 
02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
our projects are in excess of 10 million
 
02:53:47.359 --> 02:53:48.469 align:start position:0%
our projects are in excess of 10 million
dollars

02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're presently working with
 
02:53:52.230 --> 02:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
manchester waterworks on their new well
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
and treatment system in hooksett which
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
was nearly 40 million dollars
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of completing the
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
renovations and expansion of the the
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
merrimack wastewater treatment plant
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
we have a project at the portsmouth
 
02:54:09.429 --> 02:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
naval shipyard that's in excess of 60
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars

mr delgado said i'm not going to waste

any more time a couple of things i
 
03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify from previous
 
03:00:42.960 --> 03:00:44.070 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify from previous
statement

03:00:44.070 --> 03:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:00:46.469 --> 03:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
number one it is a violation of federal
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
law for any company to be excluded from
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
a project labor agreement union
 
03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
non-union whatever it's a violation of
 
03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:00:55.830 --> 03:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
if an employer chooses not to
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
participate that's their choice it's not
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
the law says they can choose
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
the reason we've never had a project
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
labor agreement state funded here in new
 
03:01:06.790 --> 03:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire is because
 
03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
we are never the low bid
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
we come in we bid the job wages benefits
 
03:01:13.510 --> 03:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
and working conditions
 
03:01:15.750 --> 03:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
the independent the so-called merit
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
shops come in they don't pay the same
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
thing that we do and that
 
03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
and what ends up happening is that we're
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
not low bid
 
03:01:27.429 --> 03:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
now why are we trying to pass
 
03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
that would say
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
even if you get the job with low bid you
 
03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't have it because that's what this
 
03:01:35.910 --> 03:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislation says
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
so that's the one thing i wanted to
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
clear up number two competition
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that everyone is
 
03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
entitled to compete for these jobs when
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
someone tells you ninety percent of the
 
03:01:46.469 --> 03:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
companies in this state can't
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
participate they're not being accurate
 
03:01:50.710 --> 03:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
every company in this state can
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
participate in a project labor agreement
 
03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to well hey i don't
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
shop at walmart should we have a bill
 
03:01:59.590 --> 03:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
that no one can shop at walmart it's
 
03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:01.110 align:start position:0%
that no one can shop at walmart it's
unfair

03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
what i did pass to the clerk was a copy
 
03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
of the transportation
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
the requirements from the department of
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
transportation for federal money
 
03:02:11.349 --> 03:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's 75 pages long so please excuse
 
03:02:13.670 --> 03:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
me for not killing 10 000 trees
 
03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:14.469 align:start position:0%
me for not killing 10 000 trees
um

03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of things we have to look at
 
03:02:23.910 --> 03:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
no one that was questioned today could
 
03:02:25.269 --> 03:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
give an answer to what happens with
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
federal money in this with this bill
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
going through
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
i'm different i called the department of
 
03:02:31.279 --> 03:02:32.230 align:start position:0%
i'm different i called the department of
labor

03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
labor
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
i spoke to the commerce department i
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
spoke to the transportation department
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i spoke to the white house and i'll
 
03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
tell you this
 
03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes sb 274 becomes law
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
in this state federal money is in risk
 
03:02:46.389 --> 03:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
coming into this state
 
03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
the mayor of manchester has written a
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
letter that she's looking at 80 million
 
03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
dollars coming in on the 80 million
 
03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
dollars coming in there's a percentage
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
of that money which is
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh cost sharing or a match by the state
 
03:02:58.319 --> 03:02:59.269 align:start position:0%
uh cost sharing or a match by the state
government

03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
so manchester's looking at an 80 million
 
03:03:02.950 --> 03:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
dollar infrastructure project and this
 
03:03:06.389 --> 03:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
bill has every ability to sideline that
 
03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bill
 
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
that isn't necessary
 
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
if we had an issue where we've always
 
03:03:13.590 --> 03:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
been doing this and it was unfair that
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
would make sense
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
we've never done it
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
if it's about competition
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
competition's there it's the law
 
03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's about fairness
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
fairness is there it's the law
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
changing this law to suit the needs of
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
some people that have a political or
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
ideological agenda that they don't want
 
03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
to get involved in project or labor
 
03:03:37.359 --> 03:03:38.389 align:start position:0%
to get involved in project or labor
agreements

03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
that is strictly 100 their choice
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
not mine so that is the extent of my
 
03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'd be more than willing
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
to take some questions
 
03:03:47.279 --> 03:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
to take some questions
representative

03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um maybe you can
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
clarify something i don't understand and
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
i think the law of the bill explicitly
 
03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
says that you can't require plas but
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
also you can't prohibit them
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
but i thought i heard you say that if
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
this were passed then even if um
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
the people you're involved with were the
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
low bidders they still could not been on
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
the project i don't see how that is
 
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
correct given the bill if the language
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
says that you can't use state money for
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
state money for a contract with the cba
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
if that's what if that that's where the
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is
 
03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
follow up cba
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
contract i'm sorry collective bargaining
 
03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:28.790 align:start position:0%
contract i'm sorry collective bargaining
agreement

03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
union contract union contract uh
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up i i think the bill maybe i'm
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
wrong and you can point out where i am
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
but i think the bill explicitly says
 
03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
but i think the bill explicitly says
that

03:04:38.550 --> 03:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
you you can't require a pla but also you
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
cannot prohibit a pla i think what my
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
testimony says representative is that
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government has requirements
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
when they bring um stimula uh
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure packages into the state
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
and again i'll reference you to the the
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
the package that i gave the the the
 
03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:57.910 align:start position:0%
the package that i gave the the the
clerk

03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
that specifically specifically that if
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to have no project labor
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
agreements in new hampshire then the
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
ability to get federal funding is in
 
03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
ability to get federal funding is in
jeopardy

03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
03:05:09.990 --> 03:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up you recognize follow-up thank
 
03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:10.710 align:start position:0%
follow-up you recognize follow-up thank
you

03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i wasn't
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
i wasn't talking about the federal
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
projects i was talking about ones funded
 
03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
by the state and you've said that if
 
03:05:19.990 --> 03:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going bill doesn't say we're
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
not going to have
 
03:05:23.190 --> 03:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements or plas
 
03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
at least that's my understanding if you
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
can point in the bill where it says that
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
please do so i don't have the bill in
 
03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
front of me but i would i would say that
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
i would stick to my main point that if
 
03:05:35.750 --> 03:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
we if this legislation does pass we are
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
not eligible for federal funding
 
03:05:40.710 --> 03:05:40.720 align:start position:0%

the senate

and
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh currently
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
we have 10 604 total positions that are
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
classified in the state of new hampshire
 
04:04:56.429 --> 04:04:56.439 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
1967 vacancies
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's 18.6 percent
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
we have 407
 
04:05:07.990 --> 04:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary listings that's up
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
to six months we have 185 vacancies
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's 45.4 percent
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified full-time we have 427 we
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
have 69 vacancies that's 15.5
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
totally we have 11 428 jobs in the state
 
04:05:28.269 --> 04:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we have
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
2221 that are unfilled
 
04:05:30.800 --> 04:05:31.630 align:start position:0%
2221 that are unfilled
that's

04:05:31.630 --> 04:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
19.4 percent
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
so the vacancy rate of the state is
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 20
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
i've got a breakdown of all of where
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
these vacancies occur but clearly we
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
needed to go in a new direction
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
and recruitment and retention are vital
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting the best possible people
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
and retaining the best possible people
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for that process to
 
04:05:56.720 --> 04:05:57.750 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for that process to
begin

04:05:57.750 --> 04:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
begin
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
directed by
 
04:06:00.000 --> 04:06:01.030 align:start position:0%
directed by
our

04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
des agency and uh
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's it we have we have a
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
crying need for people
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
this is one way to try to recruit and
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
retain people
 
04:06:13.760 --> 04:06:14.550 align:start position:0%
retain people
and

04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
admin services knows how difficult this
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
is people are here from admin services
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
that can comment on this but
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
when you have this many vacancies for
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
this long period of time
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
state government can't function as
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
as it has in in the past and that
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
creates uh that creates problems i think
 
04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
i've stated to do this to you before
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
that if we could fill every vacancy at
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
we would have no waiting list
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
currently waiting lists exist for both
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
children and adults
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
so if we could fill these jobs
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have vacancies that would be
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the public in
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
order in order to do that
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
so uh you know with that i'll address
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
any questions as i say people are here
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
from admin services who can go over the
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
specifics and can go over the amendment
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the bill uh
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
sets a process in place where you go
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
here you go there to get together excuse
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
me senator is that the amendment that
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
you adopted in the senate yes it is okay
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
well then we don't need to
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
know the details because that is the
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
bill as well that's cool that's correct
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you thank you for that
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
clarification madam chairman i couldn't
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
figure it out myself but that's okay
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you don't need to try to
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
confuse us we do just fine on our own
 
04:07:36.309 --> 04:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
confusion is the byword of the
 
04:07:36.319 --> 04:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
confusion is the byword of the
legislature

04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
mass confusion is even more important
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
senator d'allesandro this is i have an
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable question
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
um don't you think state government
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
the departments and state government are
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
striving mightily to do this on their
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
own what rabbit do you think can be
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
pulled out of the hat the rabbit of
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
course is more money but that's not
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
quite on the table well
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for the
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
question i'm sure
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
that that at each department is working
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
diligently to fill its vacancies but as
 
04:08:15.110 --> 04:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know the vacancies are there the
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
vacancies haven't been filled this is
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
another methodology to put in place to
 
04:08:22.630 --> 04:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
aid the departments in their search for
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
quality individuals but more important
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
quality individuals
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's another it's another
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
little thing in in the rabbit's hat
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
we call it a plus
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you senator you're welcome pearson
 
04:08:43.110 --> 04:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
04:08:43.120 --> 04:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
d'alessandro

04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:08:47.760 --> 04:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
so

04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
aside from looking at
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
a veto proof majority of senators that
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
are even co-sponsors of this i'm trying
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
the this is not a commission
 
04:09:03.750 --> 04:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
or a committee so this is this is sort
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand just the
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
methodology here that would
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
be employed to to come up with
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
this because as an example we in this
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee we see the
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
gentleman from
 
04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
personnel and we have a lot of
 
04:09:26.309 --> 04:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
interaction with jcec as far as
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
classifications and we heard testimony
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
earlier in reference to
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
their inability to modify
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
pay grades based on market yes things
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
that are going on so
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
with this
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
i like the idea don't get me wrong i'm
 
04:09:45.269 --> 04:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
just trying to wrap my brain around
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
how what this looks like since it's not
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
a committee or a commission okay well

cassie kane
and

04:09:52.870 --> 04:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:52.880 --> 04:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
and
her

04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%

director

04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
and director laurie could uh be very
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
helpful in giving you a clear and
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
succinct explanation
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes i cloud the issue they're
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're getting the assignment to do the
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
work so i think we should ask them what
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
it involves
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
04:10:10.319 --> 04:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
senator

04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%

so um
 
04:10:56.149 --> 04:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
we proposed this legislation and worked
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
with senator d'alessandro because
 
04:11:01.220 --> 04:11:01.230 align:start position:0%

as as the data he shared with you
[Music]

04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:11:05.110 --> 04:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
reveals we have been facing
 
04:11:05.120 --> 04:11:06.710 align:start position:0%
reveals we have been facing
significant

04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates throughout state
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
government and often in very significant
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
positions he mentioned for example new
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital commissioner hanks is
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
here department of corrections has has
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
significant vacancies nurses corrections
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
officers engineers
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
child protection workers
 
04:11:27.040 --> 04:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
child protection workers
and

04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
we've been racking our brain over the
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
years of working together about what
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
could we do differently to try and
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
recruit people to these difficult
 
04:11:37.760 --> 04:11:38.950 align:start position:0%
recruit people to these difficult
positions

04:11:38.950 --> 04:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:11:38.960 --> 04:11:40.070 align:start position:0%
positions
so

04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
one of the tools that we do not have in
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
our tool chest today is proposed in this
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and it it would give the
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
director of the division of personnel
 
04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
authority to establish a program to pay
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
incentives for recruitment and retention
 
04:11:57.439 --> 04:11:58.950 align:start position:0%
incentives for recruitment and retention
so

04:11:58.950 --> 04:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
so to get to the heart of representative
 
04:12:03.110 --> 04:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
pearson's question
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
how does this work
 
04:12:07.590 --> 04:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
it says the department shall obtain the
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee of the
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
general court prior to development
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
developing and implementing the program
 
04:12:20.640 --> 04:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
developing and implementing the program
so

04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
this would be enabling legislation that
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
director reuters would then work with
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
her staff and with our commissioner's
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
office to establish the parameters of
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
a paid incentive program for recruitment
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and retention
 
04:12:38.149 --> 04:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
and and when we settle on what that
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
model looks like the the first thing i
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
think we have to do under this bill is
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal committee and get their
 
04:12:44.159 --> 04:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal committee and get their
approval

04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
approval
 
04:12:47.910 --> 04:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that is required in line four and
 
04:12:47.920 --> 04:12:48.870 align:start position:0%
and that is required in line four and
five

04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
that would that would lay out what would
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
this program look like and i'll let
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
laurie talk a little bit to that
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
but i also want to just further answer
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's question
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
because if you go over to page two
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
line ones through three
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
it says that any expenditures for
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention incentives or
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
bonuses pursuant to this paragraph shall
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
require the approval of the fiscal
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee for the general court so the
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
way i see this um this authority
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
structure in here being is that the
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee wants to see the
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
program before it's up and running and
 
04:13:29.680 --> 04:13:30.550 align:start position:0%
program before it's up and running and
then

04:13:30.550 --> 04:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
as any agency decides that it would like
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
to offer a
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
a recruitment or attention or retention
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
incentive that they would have to go to
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and get that permission
 
04:13:45.189 --> 04:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
before they could actually offer that
 
04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
and and and of course pay
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes and then
 
04:13:50.479 --> 04:13:51.429 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes and then
schmidt

04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
are you able to um specify or give me an
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
example of the vacancies that you that
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of are these fuller
 
04:14:02.469 --> 04:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
part-time positions
 
04:14:02.479 --> 04:14:03.429 align:start position:0%
part-time positions
um

04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:03.439 --> 04:14:04.630 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
those are full-time positions not the
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
part-time positions
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
is is there more one or the other that
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
that appear to be like the most
 
04:14:12.880 --> 04:14:14.070 align:start position:0%
that appear to be like the most
vacancies

04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
it would be the full-time positions
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
right now i mean you have to look at um
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me you have to look at seasonal
 
04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
hires so those ebb and flow based on the
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
season hiring up for the parks and the
 
04:14:26.550 --> 04:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
beaches versus
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
for the ski mountains and things like
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
that but predominantly it's the
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
full-time positions that have the most
 
04:14:33.990 --> 04:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies yes thank you representative
 
04:14:34.000 --> 04:14:35.349 align:start position:0%
vacancies yes thank you representative
schmidt

04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
so uh i understand at the beginning you
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want fiscal involved
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh i know you and you for the
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility aspect fiscal would also be
 
04:14:49.750 --> 04:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
very good on a continuing basis but are
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
they going to be the only
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
authorizing or
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
can you put it in the
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
to some degree just
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe finance would be involved in
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
some respects
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
i i i always envisioned that agencies
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
would uh request uh budgeting to support
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
these programs so i i see it as multiple
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
layers of legislative oversight on on
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
where is this going and and how is it
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
being uh mobilized if you will so um i i
 
04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
no matter what an agency has to have the
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
money that they could use to
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
pay this and and the first place you do
 
04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
that is in budgeting and should an
 
04:15:33.040 --> 04:15:34.309 align:start position:0%
that is in budgeting and should an
agency

04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
access this kind of program and not have
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
it then they have to get transfer
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
permission within the budget and they
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
would do that by going to fiscal
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee as well yes
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
thanks i noticed that this
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
is uh repealed as of
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
july 1 2023
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
so which is the start of the next
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
biennium's budget
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i presume you're assuming that
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you develop in the next
 
04:16:05.040 --> 04:16:06.309 align:start position:0%
whatever you develop in the next
year

04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
will be implemented as necessary in the
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
next budget and it won't be this
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary program is that correct
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes i also think it was another check
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
and balance put in place
 
04:16:20.950 --> 04:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
around the authority and and how is it
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
um how is the program established how is
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
it being operationalized and and do they
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
want to continue
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when i look at um
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill if you go back to the first
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
page and you look at rsa 21i 42 roman 6
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
it is both a it's a it's a law that
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
gives the director of the division of
 
04:16:47.110 --> 04:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
personnel authority and responsibility
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
to take certain actions and so
 
04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
i view it as enabling legislation
 
04:16:54.560 --> 04:16:55.510 align:start position:0%
i view it as enabling legislation
okay

04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you that's uh that helps
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:17:01.680 --> 04:17:03.189 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
can you
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
are you able to compare your your
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
recruitment difficulties with those in
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
the economy at large i mean are you
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.630 --> 04:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
04:17:15.640 --> 04:17:18.630 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
[Laughter]

04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
i would say that we have some challenges
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the market comparing if
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking just base salaries that
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
we're looking at and but we have
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
excellent benefits and we're really
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
trying to market those benefits to try
 
04:17:35.110 --> 04:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
to make up for some of that compensation
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
but i think we need some flexibility i
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
think we need some tools on our toolbox
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
to compete when it's necessary and i'll
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
give you an example we have agencies
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
that might have an engineer and they're
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
both saying oh well i'll give you this
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you this and i'll give you
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
this and then this person gets this you
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
know this say the hundred thousand
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
dollars that they're getting an offer
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
for and then they just take it they go
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
to the outside community and they're
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
probably getting a hundred and forty
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for it so there's gotta
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
be multiple layers of tools that we can
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
use we would wanna focus on making sure
 
04:18:09.429 --> 04:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
that we are looking at the positions
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
that are most difficult to fill
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be like across the board
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay everybody gets a bonus everybody
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
gets to do this we also have a lot of
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
personnel laws where we have to make
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
sure that there's fairness included in
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
whatever program that we're developing
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
we can't leave it up to somebody to get
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
themselves in trouble saying i like a
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't like b and i'm going to do
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
this for a and not for b so
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that we just give
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves all the tools we can and we
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
when we need to compete
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
um we have some departments that are
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
really low on on some specific jobs that
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um are critical i would call them
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
critical positions so we need to have
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
some tools to be able to
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
retain people as well as recruit
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you does that answer your question
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you very much
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative judy
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair good afternoon
 
04:18:57.680 --> 04:18:58.550 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair good afternoon
ma'am

04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
04:19:00.630 --> 04:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
on live 15
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh can you give me more explanation
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
your retention incentives please
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
and based on what
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
life 15
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
retention incentives
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
i think i think the purpose of this is
 
04:19:20.710 --> 04:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
to make clear that it's not a gift and
 
04:19:25.349 --> 04:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
um and trigger uh rsa 21g
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
ethical obligations and i'm sorry i'm
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
not familiar with specific
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
provisions right now but it's intended
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this payment is
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good afternoon
 
04:19:42.000 --> 04:19:44.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good afternoon
ladies

04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
ladies
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
i am curious to know the nature of
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
the vacancies are you finding that these
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
are just
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
literally long-term not filled
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
or have there been situations where
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
a number of people have been employed
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
but then are dissatisfied with
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the the reason work or our
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
well i can give you a little bit
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
information and we are breaking down um
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
when somebody leaves state government
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're trying to
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
build in now is exit surveys why are you
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
leaving what is the reason
 
04:20:24.710 --> 04:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
right now they currently have if you're
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at a chat okay
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
there's a large section that says
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
personal well personal doesn't tell us
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
anything so we're working with our
 
04:20:35.110 --> 04:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
financial data management um folks to
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
get in there is it because specifically
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
because of pay are you leaving the state
 
04:20:41.349 --> 04:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
are you is it benefits you know is it a
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
bad working environment is it a
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
supervisor so um we'll be able to drill
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
down and get you more information in the
 
04:20:47.199 --> 04:20:48.550 align:start position:0%
down and get you more information in the
future

04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
so do you have
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
any kind of projection as to when this
 
04:20:57.429 --> 04:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
kind of data might be available
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um i would say we would probably
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
probably july somewhere around july we
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to have it up and running
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
and then it would take each quarter we
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
could come back and
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
be able to deliver that information
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows you had
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
04:21:16.640 --> 04:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
i know that
currently

04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:21:21.110 --> 04:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have some special incentives
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're probably related to kobit for
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
some positions
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think they both or bonuses oh okay but
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
they were
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
how how did that operate and are you
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
04:21:41.670 --> 04:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
um modeling
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
along the same line as that one did so
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
do you identify particular you don't
 
04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
identify in individuals that they have
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
to go back to fiscal to get approved i
 
04:21:58.229 --> 04:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
assume it's like some class of um i
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
agree i think what they're looking for
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
us is a program and what maybe potential
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
costs are probably fiscal no going with
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
it to say you know what do you think
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
this would cost
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
i'm imagining is that um yeah i also do
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
see us targeting um types of positions
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
that are particularly hard to recruit so
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
um i think that might be where you were
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
getting at
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
i wish i could think of a question i
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
just want to say good luck
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you man of chair
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
so this is going to tie into a couple of
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
other things that were said
 
04:22:39.439 --> 04:22:40.630 align:start position:0%
other things that were said
we

04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the jcec right we have it we
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
that are similar amongst agencies right
 
04:22:51.760 --> 04:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
that are similar amongst agencies right
together

04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
okay tip step and grade government
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
government pay it's everywhere right
 
04:22:57.920 --> 04:23:00.469 align:start position:0%
government pay it's everywhere right
so

04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:00.479 --> 04:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
so
how

04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to and i i don't
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
know if you can answer this now but
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to figure out a way
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
where you have a very specific one of
 
04:23:10.640 --> 04:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
where you have a very specific one of
those

04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
step and grade jobs right to move it
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
either move the grade
 
04:23:17.359 --> 04:23:19.030 align:start position:0%
either move the grade
or

04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
because what's going to end up you know
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
what i what jc easy was
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
created to do was to level the playing
 
04:23:24.560 --> 04:23:25.670 align:start position:0%
created to do was to level the playing
field

04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
field
 
04:23:26.830 --> 04:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
concerned that this
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
will completely untie that knot
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know in the sense of
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
not specific individuals like
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative fellows would seem to
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
address but when we're looking at
 
04:23:40.640 --> 04:23:42.149 align:start position:0%
address but when we're looking at
reclassification

04:23:42.149 --> 04:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
reclassification
 
04:23:42.159 --> 04:23:43.590 align:start position:0%
reclassification
of

04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
certain job types
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
that would that may be an answer to your
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
to what the you guys come up with
 
04:23:55.110 --> 04:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to i'm just trying to
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
can you senator d'alessandro couldn't
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
answer it but
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
this is not a committee or a commission
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
so when you're talking about a broad
 
04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
spectrum of
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
across the board government
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
um i'm confused and please help us out
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
here on because you mentioned on page
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
two line four the repeal of this
 
04:24:16.479 --> 04:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
two line four the repeal of this
that

04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
seems there's a repeal for
 
04:24:20.080 --> 04:24:21.189 align:start position:0%
seems there's a repeal for
this

04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
one or i-426
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
this rewrites i are you just
 
04:24:28.710 --> 04:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
i don't understand this repeal business
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.319 --> 04:24:33.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
so do you feel you can accomplish this
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
um i do believe that
 
04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
we will get something up and running in
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
the nature of a pilot and we will have
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
data that will allow
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature to decide oh this was a
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
good idea it worked
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
this wasn't enough time to prove the
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
idea or disprove it or it turns out it
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't a great idea and we want it to to
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
go away um
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
pardon i'm just
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that that the timeline is too
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
aggressive well if you would like to
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
extend it you're you're not going to
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
hear any opposition
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:23.110 --> 04:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
if you're aware government moves at the
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
speed of smell right so
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
a year in the real world in government
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
is not the same and that's
 
04:25:31.760 --> 04:25:32.469 align:start position:0%
is not the same and that's
right

04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:25:32.479 --> 04:25:34.309 align:start position:0%
right
we

04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
helpful to us i would expect that if
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
nothing else this would be inclu
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
any successful parts of this would be
 
04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
included in the budget
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
i hope so too
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes they would have to be yes and i had
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh this obviously is going to affect
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the employees unions
 
04:25:58.319 --> 04:25:59.670 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the employees unions
is

04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
how what are you doing about that or is
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
that a concern or what so so um there is
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
a paragraph of this that says it's
 
04:26:15.510 --> 04:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
specifically outside of um
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining i'm looking for
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
the language now so oh it's paragraph d
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
on line 24 beginning on line 24.
 
04:26:23.040 --> 04:26:23.330 align:start position:0%
on line 24 beginning on line 24.
um

04:26:23.330 --> 04:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:23.340 --> 04:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
i actually think that the unions will
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
welcome this legislatively authorized
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
program because i think what we do with
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
a recruitment and retention incentive
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
plan is we we mobilize our workforce and
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
ask them to help us
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
i'll let laurie talk about the best way
 
04:26:49.349 --> 04:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
to recruit people uh and um it turns out
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's all around us but go ahead
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
sure um i'll just talk about um a
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
program that i had in my former position
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
so it was called say we were looking at
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
getting um highway maintainers
 
04:27:03.429 --> 04:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
and that was going to be an area that we
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
were going to focus on what would do is
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
we'd have a referral bonus so that way
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
the employee's getting something after a
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
period of time and the new um the new
 
04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
employee and the
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
employee that referred them
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
so um those are the type of programs
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
that you would say okay i'm gonna go out
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
and recruit some of my buddies because
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i have a little incentive in
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
this myself to earn some bonus money so
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna you know be out there talking
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
to people that word of mouth and you're
 
04:27:32.630 --> 04:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
already working for the state is very
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
popular because you can speak to all the
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
benefits and what we have and what the
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
hours may be and to different
 
04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities throughout
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know state government so that's an
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
example of something that we would use
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
it for okay thank you representative
 
04:27:47.110 --> 04:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
blackish you had a question oh yes thank
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
you so um
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
assuming this passes and you end up
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
finding some things that work
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
for this to continue beyond
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
july of 2023
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
would it require an addition to
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
something in the budget would it require
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislation to extend or make permanent
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
some of the things in here
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
it would require a change of the date
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
and um i i think if this passes that we
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
will begin working on two fronts one is
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
we will be working on the design of the
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
program what would we want to present to
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee for approval the other
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
thing is we would begin working with
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
agencies to educate them about the
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
passage of this law so they could
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
consider the kinds of vacancies that
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
they have and and whether and to what
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
extent they might want to propose
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
funding in their budgets
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
for for the next biennium
 
04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so if i understand
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
correctly um
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
for this for anything to continue beyond
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
july 2023
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
you'll have to come back and ask for
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
some legislative change
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes unless this committee amends the
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill uh well eventually you can't yes
 
04:28:59.189 --> 04:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you good job
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative pearson you have a
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up i have a question for the
 
04:29:02.870 --> 04:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
chair i'm just trying to do i'm just
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the calendar here right so
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to start working on the next
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature will start working on
 
04:29:09.910 --> 04:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
the next budget in the fall of 22.
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
so your timeline of july of 23
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really fall in line with the
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar it it gives us
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 to get this up and
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
running and
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
because you're not going to we're you
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
know you're talking if you were to do
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
that in july you know the fall of 23
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
you're talking about amending an enacted
 
04:29:29.279 --> 04:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
you're talking about amending an enacted
budget

04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
right so this really could go you this
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
date of july of 23 could be pushed out
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
to december
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
of 23 and have really no substantive
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
effect on what you would recommend
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
on in the budget cycle because the next
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
budget cycle would be fall of 24. so so
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the next budget and forgive me if i get
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
the dates wrong but but the legislature
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
comes back in january of 23 and that's a
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
budget year and the budget is debated
 
04:29:55.760 --> 04:29:56.550 align:start position:0%
budget year and the budget is debated
from

04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
january through june right the filing
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
period would be the fall of 22. right so
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
so what you are saying that's correct is
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
all agency budgets for next fiscal year
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
are already decided right so if an
 
04:30:09.279 --> 04:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
are already decided right so if an
agency

04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
if we have approval from fiscal
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
and an agency wants to seek authority to
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
pay a recruitment or a retention
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
incentive bonus i i think most agencies
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
are going to have to go to fiscal and
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
ask to transfer money as well as
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
permission to
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
um pay a bonus for certain positions and
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
also they would include it in their
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
budget going forward for that absolutely
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay and then and they would include it
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes it's very tightly in their proposed
 
04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
budgets it's very very tight
 
04:30:44.080 --> 04:30:44.950 align:start position:0%
budgets it's very very tight
um

04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
we think it's worth it we think it's a
 
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
very important tool in the toolkit
 
04:30:51.670 --> 04:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we will
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
we will continue to be concerned about
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
your performance on the schedule
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
which which of you has a question
 
04:31:07.110 --> 04:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you i
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:10.720 --> 04:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:15.670 --> 04:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
so when this gets repealed in in july of
 
04:31:15.680 --> 04:31:17.590 align:start position:0%
so when this gets repealed in in july of
2023

04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
right now you have the authority
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
for developing a program of recruitment
 
04:31:28.960 --> 04:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
for developing a program of recruitment
selection

04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
selection
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
of qualified applicants why do you even
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
need this why can't you just operate
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
i personally don't think we have
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
authority to pay
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
incentive bonuses for recruitment or
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
retention purposes and so so um that's
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
why we
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
we asked for the legislation to be
 
04:31:54.399 --> 04:31:55.510 align:start position:0%
we asked for the legislation to be
proposed

04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
this authority that you see in existing
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
law i think it's again
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
a law that establishes the director of
 
04:32:02.800 --> 04:32:04.429 align:start position:0%
a law that establishes the director of
personnel's

04:32:04.429 --> 04:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
personnel's
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and authorities um but
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
none of it
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
none of that authorities is explicitly
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
empowers her to have a paid recruitment
 
04:32:14.640 --> 04:32:15.429 align:start position:0%
empowers her to have a paid recruitment
or

04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh retention she needs the legislation
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
to put money into it instead of just add
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
a boys and certificates yes
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
which are valuable but not not not
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
always as useful
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
you'll follow up
 
04:32:28.560 --> 04:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
you'll follow up
so

04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
i thought that you had been doing this
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
were you using federal money and so
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's why it's different was different
 
04:32:40.469 --> 04:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
than what you're proposing now
 
04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what are you talking about
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
like when the liquor stores got a 10
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
increase no she's talking about the
 
04:32:49.110 --> 04:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
covid and emergency bonuses and
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
retention programs which were federal
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
and they were also limited in time to
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
the emergency yes
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
exactly so
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't that
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
under this authority to use
 
04:33:11.670 --> 04:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
to use that no no it was under um an
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:15.039 --> 04:33:16.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
represent allegro
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting point
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
um you've had a trial period with
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to it i'll try to speak to it
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
what i think happened with that was we
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have we had people who could have
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
chosen to
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
not work any longer due to covid and
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
that we would have had a crisis on our
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
hands if we didn't give some incentives
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
i would say it was used more as like a
 
04:33:55.029 --> 04:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
hazard pay would be used saying you're
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
at risk and you're out inside of these
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
environments and we're going to
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that risk as we do we do have
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
um hazard pay that happens in other
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
areas so um i think it was more used to
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
that than really understanding how do we
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain people
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.400 --> 04:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
this this is actually i think a question
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
for the chair and that is uh sort of
 
04:34:19.520 --> 04:34:20.869 align:start position:0%
for the chair and that is uh sort of
understanding

04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
what this language does on the repeal so
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
right now there's something in 21i42
 
04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
roman 6
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
and this bill would replace it and then
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
after july 2023 it would it looks like
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
it repeals
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
rsa21i426 as it does it revert to the
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
this kind of piggies back with my
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
original question and then some of the
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
other questions and i apologize if this
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
was answered because i'm still trying to
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
figure it out from other questions
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
are you able to
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
what area
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
would you say are you having the most
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
difficulty is there like a certain area
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
where you you look at your departments
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
and say
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
this like this is the department
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we just can't keep jobs filled
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what i wanted
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
yeah we could talk corrections we could
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
talk nurses we could talk
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
child support
 
04:35:22.719 --> 04:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
child support
workers

04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:35:26.709 --> 04:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
um we have enforcement in health care
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
and in other areas um child protection
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
yeah child protection workers we have
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
engineers we have a tough we are um
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're getting out competed by the market
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
in um technology um so it's um highway
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
maintainers in in das we have um a
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
series of positions called building
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
service workers they clean state
 
04:35:49.520 --> 04:35:50.869 align:start position:0%
service workers they clean state
buildings

04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
04:35:53.590 --> 04:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have a 50 percent vacancy rate in
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
04:35:57.670 --> 04:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's just really really difficult to
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
recruit people
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
and to
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
other questions representative fellows
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
one question please
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that part of the most
 
04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
of the problem is probably that we just
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
don't pay enough you know we don't have
 
04:36:21.189 --> 04:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
competitive wages
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
thinking that
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
you know this recruitment and retention
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
bonus thing and for just a year or two
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
is not going to solve the problem and
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
also i know with the
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
on your classified employees you use
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
that firm that does an analysis of of
 
04:36:41.910 --> 04:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:36:41.920 --> 04:36:42.709 align:start position:0%
what the
what

04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
the positions and what the pay grade
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
ought to be when was the last time we
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
did something like that for the
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
classified employees positions
 
04:36:51.520 --> 04:36:53.590 align:start position:0%
classified employees positions
so

04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'll ask lori to help me out a little
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
but um when representative pearson was
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
discussing the jcec and the process that
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
we use with corn ferry we our classified
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
positions are part of a classified um
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
system and we do that same
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
sort of comparison of position types
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
across state government for all
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
classified positions in a unit in the
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
division of personnel okay
 
04:37:23.680 --> 04:37:24.949 align:start position:0%
division of personnel okay
so

04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
so we do
 
04:37:27.750 --> 04:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
if if i'm
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
i'm coming up dry with an example but if
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
i if i do this job in this department
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
and same job in this department and same
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
job in that department
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
there are similar job functions and
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
therefore those positions are ranked
 
04:37:44.561 --> 04:37:46.310 align:start position:0%
therefore those positions are ranked
similarly

04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
04:37:46.320 --> 04:37:47.269 align:start position:0%
similarly
also

04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
we just when did you let's do that um
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
well as a matter of fact we we do it um
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
fairly okay i'll let laurie's talk yeah
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
so we're doing this almost daily right
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
we have four people
 
04:38:02.789 --> 04:38:02.799 align:start position:0%
we have four people represent our
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
you like
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
when you did it for the unclassified
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
that you were comparing it
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
not just within state government you
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
were comparing it to other
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
similar positions outside of our state
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
government but i distinctly heard you
 
04:38:21.039 --> 04:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
government but i distinctly heard you
say

04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
that you answered me by saying you can
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
you were comparing positions
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
across the state i'm asking when is the
 
04:38:32.230 --> 04:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
last time for classified you made a
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
comparison to
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
outside of state government or compared
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
to other state governments and i
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
understand benefits are different but
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
you can do a calculation that kind of
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
adjusts for that i assume
 
04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i won't ask another question as long
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
as they answer my question so there's a
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
difference between ranking positions and
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
pay and we did just do a compensation
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
study and i'll let laurie speak to how
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
we do the ranking of positions and then
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll tell you about our
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
compensation study
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think the question was compensation
 
04:39:05.760 --> 04:39:06.709 align:start position:0%
i think the question was compensation
okay

04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i think um cassie's going to speak
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the fact we did two years ago um we
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
um received the authority or or we were
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
asked to
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
do a compensation study we picked 100
 
04:39:17.359 --> 04:39:18.789 align:start position:0%
do a compensation study we picked 100
positions

04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
all across the agencies all different
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
levels of the agencies
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
that report is posted on our website now
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you could take a look at if you
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
but two years a lot of things have
 
04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
changed right so um we've come into
 
04:39:36.869 --> 04:39:36.879 align:start position:0%
covert we a lot of things have happened
 
04:39:38.788 --> 04:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
that have made the market a different
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
place than it was two years ago
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the internal ranking that's
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
happening every day
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%

04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
hiring processes unveiled a dedicated
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
jobs website and initiated statewide
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
radio and social media recruiting
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
campaigns those initiatives while
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
helpful are still competing with
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
organizations like the federal bureau of
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
prisons that is offering an eleven
 
04:41:02.788 --> 04:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar sign-on bonus at their

berlin new hampshire facility
 
04:41:06.628 --> 04:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
locally even police departments like
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
pelham rochester bedford and concord are
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
offering sign-on bonuses up to fifteen
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country states like
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
alabama florida south carolina delaware
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
iowa virginia and nebraska have
 
04:41:22.230 --> 04:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
increased pay for corrections officers
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
and many have added new higher bonuses
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
to their recruitment efforts iowa as an
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
example increased pay and added hiring
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
bonuses and have seen a 15 percent
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
increase in qualified applicants
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
the department of corrections currently
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
has a 34 percent department-wide vacancy
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
rate among its security staff a 16
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate among its nurses and a 50
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate among
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
mental health clinicians
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
that equates to poor work-life balance
 
04:41:52.708 --> 04:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
for our team and significant overtime to
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
fill positions to meet our minimum
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
standard for shifts
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
corrections work is challenging work
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it's even more challenging to find
 
04:42:02.310 --> 04:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
the right person not any person but the
 
04:42:04.150 --> 04:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
right person to work inside the walls of
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
a prison allowing the state to offer
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention incentives
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
including bonuses and referral fees is
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
one positive step toward helping our
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
department attract the right people i
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you support senate
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill 226 thank you and we're happy to
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr raymond thank you

thank you mr raymond thank you
commissioner

04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
34 is pretty staggering so it
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the course of your budget
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
how fast do you expend your overtime
 
04:42:44.798 --> 04:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
how fast do you expend your overtime
line

04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:42:47.910 --> 04:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
your yearly over how quick do you use
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you for
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
that question
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
we expend the budgeted line
 
04:42:57.990 --> 04:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
in approximately one quarter in one
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
month and we have a budget foot yep
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
we've spent about three million dollars
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
a quarter in overtime
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
we budget about 4 million in that line
 
04:43:09.190 --> 04:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
there is a budget footnote that allows
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
us to move money from our
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
funded position lines and benefits lines
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
that are result of vacancies to fund the
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
overtime that's caused from those
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies so we use our own internal
 
04:43:20.240 --> 04:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
vacancies so we use our own internal
budgeting

04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
04:43:22.868 --> 04:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
lines but we have a transferring
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
mechanism last year we spent
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 16 million dollars in
 
04:43:26.958 --> 04:43:28.390 align:start position:0%
approximately 16 million dollars in
overtime

04:43:28.390 --> 04:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
and we're forecasting about the same
 
04:43:32.070 --> 04:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
this year because of the number of
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
retirements we had in december and
 
04:43:36.310 --> 04:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
poor retention efforts going on
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
currently in the work environment
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:43:44.310 --> 04:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%

04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to you and the entire
 
04:44:11.520 --> 04:44:13.030 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to you and the entire
committee

04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is harold french
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
i'm senator for district seven
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to present to you
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
senate bill 225.
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
short bill
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
so this bill will eliminate the need for
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire licensed auctioneer to
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
carry a 25 000 performance bond
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
i personally been a licensed auctioneer
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
in this state since i was 18.
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
i became an auctioneer when i was a
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
senior in high school
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
i grew up in the industry and has
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
changed drastically since the 1970s
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
until the advent of the internet a
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of all goods sold at
 
04:44:56.160 --> 04:44:57.110 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of all goods sold at
auction

04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
auction
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
were sold live and in person
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
all were conducted by licensed
 
04:45:02.000 --> 04:45:04.390 align:start position:0%
all were conducted by licensed
auctioneers

04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
auctioneers
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
today perhaps two percent of goods sold
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
at auction in new hampshire are sold
 
04:45:09.440 --> 04:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
at auction in new hampshire are sold
live

04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
live
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
with the majority being sold on the
 
04:45:12.638 --> 04:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
with the majority being sold on the
internet

04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
internet
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
this state does not require licensing
 
04:45:19.510 --> 04:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
for those conducting auctions online as
 
04:45:21.750 --> 04:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
it was determined to be impossible for
 
04:45:23.830 --> 04:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
the state to regulate interstate
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
commerce when dealing with online
 
04:45:26.638 --> 04:45:28.550 align:start position:0%
commerce when dealing with online
auctions

04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
auctions
 
04:45:31.990 --> 04:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
since the start of licensing auctioneers
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
had the requirement of maintaining a
 
04:45:36.390 --> 04:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
performance bond
 
04:45:39.270 --> 04:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
there has never been an instance where
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
the bond was used to settle a dispute
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
among the parties
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would update our licensing
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
laws making them more reasonable for the
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
way businesses conducted today
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
in eliminating an unneeded expense in
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
hurdle for those wishing to pursue
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
their business goals of auctioneering
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%

04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:47:36.440 --> 04:47:38.070 align:start position:0%
the bill
[Music]

04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a fairly
 
04:47:42.550 --> 04:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
might be uh
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
having been
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
complicated somewhere along the way i
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.680 --> 04:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.000 --> 04:47:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:47:59.350 --> 04:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
we've had a temporary licensure
 
04:48:01.600 --> 04:48:02.868 align:start position:0%
we've had a temporary licensure
requirement

04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
emergency order
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the emergency order ended
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
at december 31st
 
04:48:18.000 --> 04:48:22.150 align:start position:0%
at december 31st
2021

04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:25.670 --> 04:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
and that temporary order allowed uh
 
04:48:25.680 --> 04:48:27.110 align:start position:0%
and that temporary order allowed uh
out-of-state

04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
physicians to
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
practice in the state of new hampshire
 
04:48:31.440 --> 04:48:32.788 align:start position:0%
practice in the state of new hampshire
uh

04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.230 --> 04:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.240 --> 04:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
about

04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
that there were many
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
licenses involved in that then you've
 
04:48:45.840 --> 04:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
licenses involved in that then you've
got

04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
here they can answer that question but i
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
believe the number is somewhere around
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
22 000
 
04:49:00.320 --> 04:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
22 000
22

04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
22
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
000 contemporary licensures thank you we
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
have that we've gotten that information
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
on many other occasions okay
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
significant is that
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are several pieces of legislation
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
attempting to clarify the process of
 
04:49:18.320 --> 04:49:19.670 align:start position:0%
attempting to clarify the process of
moving

04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
moving
 
04:49:23.830 --> 04:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
from temporary licensure status
 
04:49:23.840 --> 04:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
from temporary licensure status
to

04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
permanent or continuing licensure
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
one of which is senate bill 277 and
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that's one madam chair that you've
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
already heard that extends that
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
temporary licensure date
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
got it
 
04:49:41.920 --> 04:49:44.550 align:start position:0%
got it
and

04:49:44.550 --> 04:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
so the reason why to pass on this bill
 
04:49:47.920 --> 04:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
so the reason why to pass on this bill
one

04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
is we
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
want to provide the same
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
quality assurances
 
04:49:55.280 --> 04:49:56.788 align:start position:0%
quality assurances
for

04:49:56.788 --> 04:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
for people receiving
 
04:50:06.070 --> 04:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
care from people in state as they
 
04:50:08.550 --> 04:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
receive out of state
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of quality control is assured
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
with a licensure provision
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
a person who is licensed out of state
 
04:50:19.830 --> 04:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
will present that license
 
04:50:21.270 --> 04:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's easy to do those kinds of
 
04:50:23.910 --> 04:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
background checks on people
 
04:50:26.550 --> 04:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
those quality controls are important for
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
patient safety and health
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
the second is that that's important for
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh insurers are going to be looking for
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh have has that kind of uh
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
quality assurance been verified by our
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that's uh important to make sure that
 
04:50:53.670 --> 04:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
people are getting the reimbursements
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
that they deserve for the care that
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
they're seeking
 
04:50:56.718 --> 04:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
they're seeking
uh

04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh finally uh
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know that we need a transition
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
for those folks that uh continue to use
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the temporary licensure route uh beyond
 
04:51:14.550 --> 04:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
january of 2024
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to transition
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
to a permanent licensure and this
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.240 --> 04:51:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:51:24.310 --> 04:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
new section that was added in section
 
04:51:26.638 --> 04:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
new section that was added in section
two 2

04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
the state will seek reciprocity
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
agreements with those that are not in
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
the physician compact
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
that compact covers 31 states
 
04:51:43.200 --> 04:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
that compact covers 31 states
uh

04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:51:45.600 --> 04:51:46.708 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
trying to to reach to those that might
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
not be in that compact currently
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the
 
04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
and uh because
 
04:51:59.190 --> 04:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
director lindsey
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
courtney is here i i think a remainder
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
of questions probably most efficiently
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
asked of her
 
04:52:05.440 --> 04:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
asked of her
but

04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
thank you senator we'll probably will
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
grill you a little first i think
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
i have a question what is the
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
consultation services
 
04:52:17.910 --> 04:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
referred to in line seven
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
um that would be
 
04:52:20.000 --> 04:52:20.788 align:start position:0%
um that would be
uh

04:52:20.788 --> 04:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
where a
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
in-state physician is consulting with an
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
out-of-state physician on a particular
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
type of care or modality of treatment so
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's a physician-to-physician
 
04:52:33.990 --> 04:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
consultation and not patient to
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
physician that's correct thank you very
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
much are there any other questions
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam cure
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon senator uh so has it been
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
either has it been resolved
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
established or ju by adjudication or
 
04:52:54.320 --> 04:52:56.868 align:start position:0%
established or ju by adjudication or
whatever

04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
i know the mayfair decision came down a
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
couple years ago
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether a service that's provided
 
04:53:06.550 --> 04:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
by telehealth
 
04:53:06.560 --> 04:53:07.510 align:start position:0%
by telehealth
is

04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
is being
 
04:53:09.280 --> 04:53:11.030 align:start position:0%
is being
performed

04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
performed
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of the recipient or the
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
state of the provider or maybe even both
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
what is the state status status of the
 
04:53:20.480 --> 04:53:21.510 align:start position:0%
what is the state status status of the
law

04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
right at the moment with regard to that
 
04:53:23.600 --> 04:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
right at the moment with regard to that
issue

04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:53:26.708 --> 04:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
the director
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
answer that because i think they're
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're picking up on the variety the
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
variations on
 
04:53:36.788 --> 04:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
delivery uh if a person is in state i
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
mean this is this is particular to an
 
04:53:38.798 --> 04:53:40.070 align:start position:0%
mean this is this is particular to an
in-state

04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
in-state
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh person seeking care in-state
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
and then there are all sorts of
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
variations off of that
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah you probably everything follow up
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you probably have seen some of
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
them yourself i certainly have received
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
a bunch of emails
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
talking about please kill 282 because
 
04:54:04.470 --> 04:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
sorry 382 because uh we want the freedom
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah but the question is
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
what is the law with regard to
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
and there again there are very many
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
variations if a person is deployed out
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
of state and has out-of-state insurance
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
coverage uh for that the person is going
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
to seek the
 
04:54:24.550 --> 04:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
the care from a person in whatever state
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
that their they have their insurance
 
04:54:26.240 --> 04:54:27.190 align:start position:0%
that their they have their insurance
coverage

04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:54:29.110 --> 04:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh provided for
 
04:54:29.120 --> 04:54:30.868 align:start position:0%
uh provided for
uh

04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
but again i i i'll let that
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of i understand your
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
reluctance to just a lot of variations
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
on that question
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
other questions for the center
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:57.030 --> 04:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon lindsay courtney
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
oplc is pleased to testify in support of
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 382
 
04:55:04.160 --> 04:55:05.110 align:start position:0%
senate bill 382
which

04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
is really intended
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
to clarify the existing state of the law
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire which is that in order
 
04:55:13.590 --> 04:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
to practice in this state and the
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
provision of services is deemed to occur
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the state where the patient is
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
located that you need a license
 
04:55:20.320 --> 04:55:21.270 align:start position:0%
located that you need a license
um

04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that is is not explicitly
 
04:55:25.830 --> 04:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
clear because it's not set forth in
 
04:55:28.628 --> 04:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
statute but it's been interpreted i
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
think by regulators as well as other
 
04:55:32.320 --> 04:55:34.310 align:start position:0%
think by regulators as well as other
states

04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
to to be that way and the reason for
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
twofold first the state obviously has an
 
04:55:42.868 --> 04:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting the people within
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
its state
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
um if a person is in new hampshire we
 
04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
have an interest in protecting the
 
04:55:49.830 --> 04:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
person in new hampshire we probably
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the same interest in
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
protecting somebody in you know alabama
 
04:55:53.920 --> 04:55:55.350 align:start position:0%
protecting somebody in you know alabama
um

04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
but also um our jurisdictionally right
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
our our ability our jurisdiction only
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
extends uh to new hampshire so when
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
given the choice of does our jerks
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction extend to where the
 
04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
provider is located or does it extend to
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
where the patient is located
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
um public policy probably dictates that
 
04:56:18.150 --> 04:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction really is uh governed
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
by where the patient is located because
 
04:56:21.750 --> 04:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of licensing is to protect
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:56:26.470 --> 04:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
so um throughout the pandemic obviously
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
as you know telehealth essentially
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
exploded overnight and and um you know
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
the platform grew immensely
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we started to field a lot of
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions about do i need a license for
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
this do i need a license for that um
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's not typically with within our
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
practice based on legal advice from doj
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
to provide such legal advice right do
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
you need a license
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
we point people to the statute and the
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
rules and the statute and rules say well
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
if you're practicing medicine in new
 
04:56:57.990 --> 04:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire you need a license in new
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire but it doesn't explicitly
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
state what constitutes practice in new
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so that's what this is
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
intended to cover
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
the other issue this addresses is choice
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
of law
 
04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
the only other
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
association group of
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
a group of associations that i'm aware
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
of that have taken an alternative
 
04:57:19.520 --> 04:57:21.270 align:start position:0%
of that have taken an alternative
position

04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:57:21.280 --> 04:57:22.868 align:start position:0%
position
to

04:57:22.868 --> 04:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the idea that the provision of
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
services occurs where the patient is
 
04:57:26.878 --> 04:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
services occurs where the patient is
located

04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
located
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
is a couple of the social work or mental
 
04:57:31.990 --> 04:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
health associations nationally have
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
taken the position that
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the service occurs where both the
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
provider and the patient is located
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
that really makes no sense
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
because the laws differ in each state so
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the duty to warn may be
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
different than in massachusetts
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
so if the provider is in new hampshire
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
but the patient is in massachusetts
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
which law do they have to follow
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
there there really should only be one
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
that they have to follow and i would
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
submit that it should be
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts because that's where the
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
patient is located and massachusetts has
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
an interest in protecting that patient
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
so again this was intended to clarify
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
the existing state of the law
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
which has always been that if you're
 
04:58:19.920 --> 04:58:21.030 align:start position:0%
which has always been that if you're
practicing

04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
or providing services in new hampshire
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
to somebody located in new hampshire
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
that you need a license
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
um there were concerns i think based on
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
confusion in the stakeholder community
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:58:36.868 --> 04:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
that this statute would essentially
 
04:58:39.190 --> 04:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate the ability to seek providers
 
04:58:39.200 --> 04:58:40.390 align:start position:0%
eliminate the ability to seek providers
elsewhere

04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
04:58:43.510 --> 04:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and that from my perspective is not
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
um not the case
 
04:58:47.670 --> 04:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
however um
 
04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
based on those concerns you know i think
 
04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
what we largely heard was that there was
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
a concern that providers needing
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
licensure could not obtain licensure
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
easily and so particularly for
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
physicians and so section two is
 
04:59:04.550 --> 04:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
intended to address that by allowing the
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
state to enter into reciprocity
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
agreements to streamline that process
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
we do have a medicine compact so
 
04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
physician compact
 
04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
and again 31 states are participating i
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
would not say it's the best compact
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's not like the nursing
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
compact or the driver's license compact
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
that you can just go wherever
 
04:59:28.948 --> 04:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
it does require one to apply to the
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
federation of state medical boards
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
to process their credentials and right
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
now there's an eight to twelve week
 
04:59:35.040 --> 04:59:37.110 align:start position:0%
now there's an eight to twelve week
backlog

04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
backlog
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
i will say that this would allow us to
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
enter into separate agreements with
 
04:59:41.920 --> 04:59:43.910 align:start position:0%
enter into separate agreements with
states

04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process
 
04:59:48.550 --> 04:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
and additionally
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
we already have existing ability to
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
issue temporary licenses to people who
 
04:59:54.550 --> 04:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
are pursuing permanent licensure so
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
um there certainly is an opportunity for
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
people to obtain license in a in a fast
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
um with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
05:00:06.788 --> 05:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
my goodness
 
05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%

05:00:14.948 --> 05:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll ask my question by way of
 
05:00:18.628 --> 05:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
example so that it
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
can lead us to a yes or no answer
 
05:00:23.190 --> 05:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
say a patient lives in massachusetts
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
they're physicians in massachusetts they
 
05:00:27.430 --> 05:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
move to new hampshire
 
05:00:30.230 --> 05:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
they can't find a suitable or acceptable
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
physician in new hampshire that does the
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
same thing maybe it's a specialist
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
so they go back to their massachusetts
 
05:00:36.798 --> 05:00:37.990 align:start position:0%
so they go back to their massachusetts
physician

05:00:37.990 --> 05:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
physician
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
and indeed that physician even
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
prescribes a medication for them
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
which is delivered to a new hampshire
 
05:00:43.840 --> 05:00:45.030 align:start position:0%
which is delivered to a new hampshire
pharmacy

05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
and insurance covers that prescription
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
will that be allowable under
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
this current bill or this law
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
the question will depend on where did
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
the consul where did the patient visit
 
05:00:58.798 --> 05:00:59.670 align:start position:0%
the consul where did the patient visit
occur

05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
occur
 
05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
um if the person went down to boston
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
like i do i get all my specialist
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
treatment in boston um
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
then certainly the provider was
 
05:01:09.830 --> 05:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine in massachusetts
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law is governed
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
they absolutely can do that this bill
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
has no impact on that
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
and they can certainly
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
dispense to a new hampshire pharmacy
 
05:01:20.400 --> 05:01:21.750 align:start position:0%
dispense to a new hampshire pharmacy
follow-up

05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
so let's i'm gonna complicate it a
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
little bit and say it's
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
there was no visit no subsequent visit
 
05:01:30.150 --> 05:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
but the patient is on an ongoing
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
prescription so they haven't visited
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
that physician now in massachusetts
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
since they changed their residence to
 
05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:01:37.280 --> 05:01:38.150 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
but

05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
they need that prescription the
 
05:01:40.080 --> 05:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
they need that prescription the
physician

05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
physician
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
supplies the prescription and it's
 
05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
picked up in new hampshire is that
 
05:01:44.240 --> 05:01:47.270 align:start position:0%
picked up in new hampshire is that
allowable

05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes because that there was no
 
05:01:50.400 --> 05:01:51.750 align:start position:0%
yes because that there was no
service

05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
service
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
occurring between the physician and it's
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
based on a first of all there's an
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
exemption in the medical statute for the
 
05:02:01.110 --> 05:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
medicine statute
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
for those types of consultations across
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
border and then secondly i would submit
 
05:02:07.590 --> 05:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
that that's not
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
providing a service it's certainly
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
continuing to authorize prescriptions
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
but as you know
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i know representative marsh knows
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
that physicians will call you back often
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
for a visit saying i can't authorize any
 
05:02:20.320 --> 05:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
for a visit saying i can't authorize any
more

05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptions based on prior
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
examinations without submitting to
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
another examination so the question
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know in a follow-up service how does
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
that occur and i will also say that this
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
issue came up during the pandemic the
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
reason why we issued 22 000 health care
 
05:02:40.868 --> 05:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
licenses was because 15 000 of them were
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
boston providers who were new hampshire
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid enrolled
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
providers and our patients could not go
 
05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
to boston hospitals to receive the
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
services in massachusetts they didn't
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
typically need a new hampshire license
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
because they were physically going there
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
and when the blossom providers moved to
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
a telehealth platform they were deemed
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be practicing in new hampshire which
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
is why we needed to issue all of those
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
licenses so that those services could
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
continue so it it does it is the state
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
of it is the existing state of the law
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
there would be no change in the existing
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you you this gets to the
 
05:03:21.270 --> 05:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
question of
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
as to whether
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know someone resides in new
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they consult through
 
05:03:28.000 --> 05:03:30.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they consult through
telemedicine

05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know is it clear that that doctor
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
must be licensed in new hampshire and my
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
question you said there would be
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
you gave some justification for a
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
particular interpretation what i'm
 
05:03:47.190 --> 05:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
asking is has there been any case law
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
either in new hampshire
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
first or if not new hampshire elsewhere
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
addressing that question that you know
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
of i'm not aware of any case law in new
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire addressing that issue i am
 
05:04:00.550 --> 05:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
aware of case law elsewhere um
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
i obviously don't have citations off the
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
top of my head and i could certainly
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
provide that information to you i would
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
say that it's implicit not explicit in
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
the existing statutory framework because
 
05:04:14.550 --> 05:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
the for example the physician practice
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
act speaks to requirements for licensure
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
that you need a license
 
05:04:22.628 --> 05:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
to do x y and z in new hampshire it's
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
implied right because the state can only
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
regulate what's in their
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
what's within their border and then it
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
carves out exemptions
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions being consultation services
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
which implies that you know maybe the
 
05:04:38.310 --> 05:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
service is actually occurring in new
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire but we're going to carve out
 
05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
this exemption
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
also carves out an exemption for if you
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
have an established physician-patient
 
05:04:46.000 --> 05:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
have an established physician-patient
relationship

05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
05:04:49.590 --> 05:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
um it carves out that
 
05:04:52.470 --> 05:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
exemption and you're on the border
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
so the fact that the legislature felt
 
05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
the need to carve out exemptions to me
 
05:04:57.680 --> 05:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
the need to carve out exemptions to me
suggests

05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
from a statutory standpoint that
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
certainly this is the case
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i understand
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
that i mean that's your interpretation
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it's whether it's
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not um just uh if you
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
could send me anything where there's
 
05:05:15.510 --> 05:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
actually you know been uh judicial
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
opinions on that i appreciate sure
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
director courtney for taking my question
 
05:05:27.990 --> 05:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
my question relates to the consultation
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
exemption on line seven and i'm asking
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
this question in the context of being
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
the chair of the rare disease advisory
 
05:05:36.150 --> 05:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
council where that exemption comes into
 
05:05:36.160 --> 05:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
council where that exemption comes into
play

05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
play
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
there may be some
 
05:05:41.590 --> 05:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
certain physicians who may be one in the
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
country say in los angeles who knows a
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
particular disease my understanding of
 
05:05:49.990 --> 05:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
that exemption is that the the 329 21 2
 
05:05:52.948 --> 05:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
exemption allows my rare disease patient
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be seen in a telemedicine servicing
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with the rare disease
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
specialist who is for instance in
 
05:05:59.120 --> 05:06:00.550 align:start position:0%
specialist who is for instance in
california

05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
california
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
as long as that
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
patient also has a physician in the
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire who actually
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
writes the orders for whatever treatment
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
is decided by is that correct yes that's
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
i have i kinda i guess i have two
 
05:06:18.160 --> 05:06:20.470 align:start position:0%
i have i kinda i guess i have two
questions

05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:06:20.480 --> 05:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
questions
this

05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:06:23.110 --> 05:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
outside of a compact we're looking at
 
05:06:31.830 --> 05:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
some folks in some other states
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
is there
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
any state in new england that is not in
 
05:06:42.708 --> 05:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
that the compact that we're in
 
05:06:44.628 --> 05:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head representative i
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
don't know for medicine
 
05:06:50.788 --> 05:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
okay i can get that information too
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay so then
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
my second my second question
 
05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
this this amends 310 a1g house senate
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill 277 amends 310 a1i and f
 
05:07:03.040 --> 05:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
bill 277 amends 310 a1i and f
or

05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:07:12.868 --> 05:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
do these have to exist together i mean i
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
i i know that one of them involves the
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
temporary the emergency licenses that
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
were issued under coven and whether or
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
not we're going to extend those out to
 
05:07:22.320 --> 05:07:23.830 align:start position:0%
not we're going to extend those out to
2024

05:07:23.830 --> 05:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
2024
 
05:07:25.750 --> 05:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
and this one's
 
05:07:28.150 --> 05:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
along the lines of continuing to do some
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
covet type of things we did but it isn't
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it is in reference to licensing
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise this committee wouldn't have
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
it but
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
do you see a tie-in between
 
05:07:40.708 --> 05:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
382 and 277
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to some extent i think the reason why
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
we drafted as creating a new section
 
05:07:46.708 --> 05:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
was so that it there wouldn't be
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
conflicts when the bills are enrolled
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
because we saw that last session um so
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
i've learned my lesson with that
 
05:07:52.400 --> 05:07:53.590 align:start position:0%
i've learned my lesson with that
um

05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
but i think overall portability is a
 
05:07:57.430 --> 05:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
huge problem and we'll talk about that
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
at 3 30. uh these are really band-aids
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
and like 277's a band-aid
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
um i think the state we really need to
 
05:08:08.390 --> 05:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
figure this out um and have one cohesive
 
05:08:10.948 --> 05:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
solution or two uh to the problem of
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
portability because new hampshire is not
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're not home growing our workforce so
 
05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're attracting it from other states
 
05:08:17.840 --> 05:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
we're attracting it from other states
and

05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think our licensure needs to
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
recognize that portability is is going
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
to impact our ability to meet our
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
workforce demands so i view it as a
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
band-aid i don't think there's a
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
conflict because of the way that it's
 
05:08:32.400 --> 05:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
conflict because of the way that it's
written

05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
um but i'm hopeful that uh that over the
 
05:08:36.638 --> 05:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
um but i'm hopeful that uh that over the
next

05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
session we'll be able to to make some
 
05:08:39.440 --> 05:08:43.590 align:start position:0%
session we'll be able to to make some
decisions

05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
represent marsh
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to answer the question
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
about the interstate medical licensure
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
compact because this is something we
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with in hhs it's my understanding
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
that the state of massachusetts does not
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
participate in that compact although
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
they just introduced legislation in
 
05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
march to do something
 
05:09:03.750 --> 05:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of disconcerting since
 
05:09:08.550 --> 05:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense because they
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
historically have not joined compacts
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
in that case i certainly hope you get a
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
a reciprocity agreement very very
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
quickly although i understand they're
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
not excited about those either right
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay um i do have one question i've
 
05:09:27.440 --> 05:09:28.868 align:start position:0%
okay um i do have one question i've
heard

05:09:28.868 --> 05:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
numerous advertisements for ver for uh
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
various websites and so forth that say
 
05:09:36.320 --> 05:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
various websites and so forth that say
you

05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
just call us log on the doctor will talk
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
to you and we'll give you a prescription
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
for viagra
 
05:09:47.190 --> 05:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's the most common one yes
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
no i've heard the ads my question is are
 
05:09:50.320 --> 05:09:51.270 align:start position:0%
no i've heard the ads my question is are
those

05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
websites and programs practicing
 
05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
medicine illegally
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
i would think if they're not licensed
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
then yes
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
if there's a new hampshire patient
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we saw that with cannabis right
 
05:10:06.550 --> 05:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
during the emergency order we there are
 
05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
shops that
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
popped open
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
05:10:13.120 --> 05:10:14.230 align:start position:0%
specifically to
approve

05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
approve
 
05:10:16.708 --> 05:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis for new hampshire patients but
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
if yeah if they were not
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
if they're not licensed here then i
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
would think that that would be
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:26.550 --> 05:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i thought that was the case
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
but it
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm not a lawyer any other questions
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
just my general edification how is that
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
enforced for instance if somebody orders
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
a viagra from seven states away
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the problem and that's
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
another reason why we want to clarify
 
05:10:46.400 --> 05:10:48.628 align:start position:0%
another reason why we want to clarify
that

05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
that the service occurs where the
 
05:10:51.670 --> 05:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
patient is located because often you're
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
in an investigation or disciplinary
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
action your witnesses are going to be
 
05:10:54.958 --> 05:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
action your witnesses are going to be
here

05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:10:55.920 --> 05:10:56.788 align:start position:0%
here
um

05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:58.948 --> 05:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
the person complaining should be able to
 
05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
complain to the local medical board
 
05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
05:11:03.360 --> 05:11:04.390 align:start position:0%
but uh
that

05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
the enforcement mechanism it depends on
 
05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
the board
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
most of them have no enforcement
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism other than to refer it over to
 
05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
the department of justice and the
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
for potential criminal and civil action
 
05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
we in the last budget cycle um
 
05:11:20.958 --> 05:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
we in the last budget cycle um
and

05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
we we changed the way we
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
work with doj in that sense and that
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're fully funding their
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
two positions and consumers specifically
 
05:11:32.230 --> 05:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated to unlicensed practice because
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
medicine does have the capability to
 
05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
fine people for unlicensed practice
 
05:11:40.560 --> 05:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
fine people for unlicensed practice
but

05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's hit or miss whether we collect and
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
whether it actually prevents people from
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
so in the last bill and i think you were
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
still well are you already here for that
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot about
 
05:12:05.440 --> 05:12:06.868 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot about
um

05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
low numbers of employees in
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
a number of agencies and ways of trying
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
to get at that but this strikes me as as
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
being something that is maybe
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
as bad or worse
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to all this interstate stuff
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
and tele whatever
 
05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
telemedicine especially
 
05:12:29.350 --> 05:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
are we as bad off
 
05:12:29.360 --> 05:12:30.150 align:start position:0%
are we as bad off
and

05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
because it looks to me like we're kind
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
of heading for a cliff where thing
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
things break down in terms of the
 
05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
ability you already talked about
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and so forth so you can
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
so if they're licensed here we can take
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
action so that's why we prefer them to
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
be licensed because if we take action on
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
their license we have obligations to
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
report it to the national practitioner
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
data bank and if it's other professions
 
05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
other reporting and then if they try to
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
get licensed elsewhere or if the public
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
wants to look them up they can see it's
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
completely transparent
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
the unlicensed practice is problematic
 
05:13:05.040 --> 05:13:06.230 align:start position:0%
the unlicensed practice is problematic
because

05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
because it lacks that
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
level of transparency but the generally
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
a licensing board's jurisdiction only
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
extends over their licensees it probably
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
should be the case right which is why we
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
refer to doj
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
was your question more about the
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
workforce are we do we have workforce
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
issues or is it more about enforcement
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
as we roll out uh continue to roll out
 
05:13:30.080 --> 05:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
as we roll out uh continue to roll out
telehealth

05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
well enforcement is obviously a very
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
important aspect because to the degree
 
05:13:39.350 --> 05:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
you get some kind of an order
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
because somebody's doing something
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
illegal and they say
 
05:13:43.680 --> 05:13:44.788 align:start position:0%
illegal and they say
basically

05:13:44.788 --> 05:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:13:46.070 --> 05:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
piss off
 
05:13:46.080 --> 05:13:49.670 align:start position:0%
piss off
uh

05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:49.680 --> 05:13:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's a very bad situation because that
 
05:13:55.270 --> 05:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
on the it with the internet that's going
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
to get around
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
nationwide worldwide
 
05:13:59.280 --> 05:14:00.070 align:start position:0%
nationwide worldwide
and

05:14:00.070 --> 05:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:02.550 --> 05:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
so then it grows like topsy
 
05:14:02.560 --> 05:14:03.430 align:start position:0%
so then it grows like topsy
so

05:14:03.430 --> 05:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
yeah the international stuff is more
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
difficult with interstate practice
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit easier so for example
 
05:14:11.120 --> 05:14:12.070 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit easier so for example
if

05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
we caught wind that somebody was
 
05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
practicing without a license but they
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
were licensed elsewhere
 
05:14:20.788 --> 05:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
we would typically report it to that
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
licensure board wherever they're
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
licensed because they may they probably
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
have a catch-all clause that says you
 
05:14:26.320 --> 05:14:27.190 align:start position:0%
have a catch-all clause that says you
know

05:14:27.190 --> 05:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
agree to practice ethically which it's
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
probably not ethical to
 
05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
you know illegally practice
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
um so that's why it's the people who
 
05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
are not licensed in another state and
 
05:14:41.830 --> 05:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
are just doing things um
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that i think are most
 
05:14:48.150 --> 05:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
difficult um but doj has pursued uh you
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
know criminal and civil actions against
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
those individuals you know after
 
05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
investigation so
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
i know we in the past we've had big
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
pill mills in florida for example but
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's not the only state or
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
maybe not even the worst state anymore
 
05:15:07.760 --> 05:15:08.708 align:start position:0%
maybe not even the worst state anymore
because

05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
everything is expanding so crazily
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
an opening is like water goes wherever
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
the opening is
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think the question with
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill has to be whether or
 
05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
not the state has requirements that are
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent or exceed our
 
05:15:25.840 --> 05:15:26.788 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent or exceed our
um

05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:26.798 --> 05:15:28.470 align:start position:0%
um
our

05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
requirements and the idea of a compact
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
or reciprocity agreement really is based
 
05:15:34.868 --> 05:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
on trust of the other state we're
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
trusting the other state first of all
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
they have the requirements in place that
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
are like ours and we're trusting the
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
other state to vet them
 
05:15:40.958 --> 05:15:42.390 align:start position:0%
other state to vet them
um

05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we don't want to trust
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
the other state to vet them and then we
 
05:15:46.550 --> 05:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't have any compacts in any
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
agreements but then it takes longer for
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
our people to get licensed which could
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
impact workforce so those are the type
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
of policy
 
05:15:52.480 --> 05:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
of policy
um

05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
things that you know the state needs to
 
05:15:55.200 --> 05:15:56.150 align:start position:0%
things that you know the state needs to
consider

05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
i've i support compacts because i think
 
05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
first of all it recognizes the state's
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
right to regulate people within its
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
borders and um
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
and to determine the requirements
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
um ours may not be the same so if if
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're not the same we don't enter into
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
a compact
 
05:16:15.760 --> 05:16:16.708 align:start position:0%
a compact
um

05:16:16.708 --> 05:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
and it allows us to
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
to promote or to allow workforce
 
05:16:27.510 --> 05:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we are un under
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
duress in terms of uh timeline and all
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
this other kind of stuff
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
is is it
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
your opinion as oplc director that this
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
is something that we can and should do
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i think so i think that
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
there needs to be clarity um although
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's clear i'm an attorney so uh
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's not clear because we get
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
calls with us every day
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
i think it would be nice to be able to
 
05:17:05.590 --> 05:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
point them to a statute saying this is
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
i have a question you said that there is
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
an exemption
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
how what kind of an exemption is that
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
how long does it go for so
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
i believe the exemption on that that one
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
is if you're traveling so let's say
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
somebody in florida is traveling
 
05:17:33.750 --> 05:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
and they're here temporarily i think the
 
05:17:35.670 --> 05:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
statute uses the term temporarily in the
 
05:17:35.680 --> 05:17:37.110 align:start position:0%
statute uses the term temporarily in the
state

05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:17:38.150 --> 05:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
they can
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
still consult with their position but
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
down in florida and donate a license
 
05:17:44.470 --> 05:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then there's also an exemption for
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
cross-border practice so if you're
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
if you're somebody who practices on the
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
border let's say with massachusetts and
 
05:17:53.590 --> 05:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
the patient lives over the border
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's an exception for that as well
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:18:00.400 --> 05:18:01.270 align:start position:0%
other questions
okay

05:18:01.270 --> 05:18:01.280 align:start position:0%

05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for joining us thank
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
you all right is there any anyone else
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i will close the
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:18.788 --> 05:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
and we have 12 minutes before the next
 
05:18:18.798 --> 05:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
and we have 12 minutes before the next
one

05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:52.320 --> 05:31:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:57.350 --> 05:31:57.360 align:start position:0%

the
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
the notice was a little confusing
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
because it repeated everything the bill
 
05:32:11.040 --> 05:32:11.910 align:start position:0%
because it repeated everything the bill
did

05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%

right and and it addressed the original
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee that was in
 
05:33:20.150 --> 05:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%

senator gaida as the prime sponsor
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
and our chair as one of the co-sponsors
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the suggestion
 
05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
of our chair
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
i added
 
05:33:36.480 --> 05:33:37.430 align:start position:0%
i added
the

05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
portions of
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
the study that we killed from senate
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill 313
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
that addressed funding
 
05:33:51.750 --> 05:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
part of the funding issues for oplc
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
that was added into
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:33:55.440 --> 05:33:56.948 align:start position:0%
this amendment

24
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
rather than create two separate studies
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
just have the study that was in this
 
05:34:01.920 --> 05:34:03.590 align:start position:0%
just have the study that was in this
bill

05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:34:08.230 --> 05:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
then um
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
on page 2
 
05:34:16.850 --> 05:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
beginning page line 16
 
05:34:16.860 --> 05:34:18.788 align:start position:0%
beginning page line 16
[Music]

05:34:18.788 --> 05:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:34:20.548 --> 05:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
again with
 
05:34:23.670 --> 05:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
some oversight from our chair
 
05:34:26.708 --> 05:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
i worked on the language to create an
 
05:34:29.110 --> 05:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
05:34:29.120 --> 05:34:30.150 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
to

05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
try and examine some of the issues that
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
05:34:34.878 --> 05:34:36.470 align:start position:0%
we've heard
between

05:34:36.470 --> 05:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
interactions of various boards
 
05:34:38.320 --> 05:34:40.310 align:start position:0%
interactions of various boards
commissions

05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
05:34:40.320 --> 05:34:41.430 align:start position:0%
commissions
councils

05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
councils
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
and the administration portion of oplc
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
an oversight committee
 
05:34:49.920 --> 05:34:51.110 align:start position:0%
an oversight committee
somewhat

05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
like the oversight committee for health
 
05:34:54.548 --> 05:34:54.558 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to hear some of these
 
05:34:56.080 --> 05:34:57.830 align:start position:0%
would be able to hear some of these
concerns

05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:34:57.840 --> 05:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
concerns
suggest

05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
05:35:01.110 --> 05:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
remedies and
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully smooth things out
 
05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
so that the operation
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
of all the boards and commissions
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
is a little more smooth
 
05:35:12.548 --> 05:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
other than that if i can answer any
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions i will try
 
05:35:15.920 --> 05:35:19.110 align:start position:0%
questions i will try
representative

05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
at least initially just one on the new
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
section um line 32 on page two
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
um and it's saying you know who all
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
should be um
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
to bring things the attention i would
 
05:35:32.240 --> 05:35:33.270 align:start position:0%
to bring things the attention i would
suggest

05:35:33.270 --> 05:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
given that the whole purpose of
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing is at least
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
nominally to protect the public
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
that it should have said and members of
 
05:35:44.310 --> 05:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
should i don't see it in there
 
05:35:47.440 --> 05:35:48.708 align:start position:0%
should i don't see it in there
um

05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
then a follow-up if i could
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
a lot yeah at uh
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
at some point i'd like an explanation of
 
05:35:57.840 --> 05:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
at some point i'd like an explanation of
um

05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%

the part dealing with the repeals and
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
the interaction with the original bill
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the wrestling commission and all
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%

appeals
 
05:36:20.948 --> 05:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
however the uh drafting attorney
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
objected to that language stating that
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
appeals are something that need to be
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by courts the repeals the
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%

different study committee that we're
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
combining with the funding
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
portion from 313 correct and then all
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
after section 9 we're adding a new
 
05:38:04.708 --> 05:38:04.718 align:start position:0%

non-germain
 
05:38:37.830 --> 05:38:37.840 align:start position:0%

interruption but please proceed
 
05:38:47.830 --> 05:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i appreciate
 
05:38:49.430 --> 05:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
the assistance i
 
05:38:49.440 --> 05:38:50.390 align:start position:0%
the assistance i
unfortunately

05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:38:52.150 --> 05:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
i had
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
a different draft of the amendment i'm
 
05:38:57.030 --> 05:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
not sure how that happened but
 
05:38:58.788 --> 05:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
we went through a couple different
 
05:39:02.628 --> 05:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
iterations trying to craft the language
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
and it it's true the the rest of the
 
05:39:04.958 --> 05:39:05.990 align:start position:0%
and it it's true the the rest of the
bill

05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:39:09.350 --> 05:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
was not my intention to be affected just
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
adding the funding to the original study
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then the oversight committee
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i leave it to the
 
05:39:20.070 --> 05:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee members if they feel
 
05:39:23.190 --> 05:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
somehow the public should be included
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
in some of that language
 
05:39:26.000 --> 05:39:26.948 align:start position:0%
in some of that language
the

05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:28.470 --> 05:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:39:28.480 --> 05:39:30.230 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
perhaps

05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
director courtney can answer if
 
05:39:35.590 --> 05:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the public is actually
 
05:39:35.600 --> 05:39:36.948 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the public is actually
involved

05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
in interactions of oplc and their boards
 
05:39:41.750 --> 05:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
and councils
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
the boards have public members
 
05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
and most of the complaints come from the
 
05:39:51.440 --> 05:39:53.670 align:start position:0%
and most of the complaints come from the
public

05:39:53.670 --> 05:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:39:53.680 --> 05:39:54.788 align:start position:0%
public
okay

05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
 
05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
um schmidt
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering i mean i i hear where
 
05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
you're coming from tony with regard to
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
the idea that a member of the public
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
maybe should be involved the problem is
 
05:40:10.230 --> 05:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
that even in this committee where we
 
05:40:11.510 --> 05:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
all these things to some degree on a
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
or have in the past
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:23.520 --> 05:40:24.548 align:start position:0%
 
just

05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with all the various
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
different aspects that he or she might
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
have to be involved in and they
 
05:40:34.150 --> 05:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
might or might not be more trouble than
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're worth
 
05:40:38.788 --> 05:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of being able to be helpful
 
05:40:38.798 --> 05:40:39.990 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of being able to be helpful
um

05:40:39.990 --> 05:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:42.788 --> 05:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
even if i like the idea of maybe getting
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of a genius uh that could help
 
05:40:45.680 --> 05:40:47.670 align:start position:0%
some kind of a genius uh that could help
um

05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we have any geniuses that
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
want to take this on
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a question representative
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
well the first question i have is just
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
since representative schuett says she
 
05:41:01.310 --> 05:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
has a funky copy are we all looking at
 
05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
1424 h
 
05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes i have the correct
 
05:41:08.230 --> 05:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative grota found the correct
 
05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
copy for me
 
05:41:11.910 --> 05:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i will point out that
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
the original study
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
requested in 3 30
 
05:41:20.310 --> 05:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
is designed to report by i believe it's
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
november 1st
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
of this year and the oversight committee
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
is to take effect
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
january 1st of 2023
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to perhaps utilize
 
05:41:38.470 --> 05:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
study originally in 330 may come up with
 
05:41:42.000 --> 05:41:43.030 align:start position:0%
study originally in 330 may come up with
as

05:41:43.030 --> 05:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
suggestions or things to be looked at
 
05:41:49.750 --> 05:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative lekis thank you i just
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify the question i was
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
asking um
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
and it was on
 
05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
the section three line of page two line
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
thirty two
 
05:41:59.910 --> 05:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
i was asking if you consider adding
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
members of the public to the list not as
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee
 
05:42:05.430 --> 05:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
but as um
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know the group of people that might
 
05:42:08.240 --> 05:42:09.430 align:start position:0%
you know the group of people that might
um

05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
bring issues to the attention
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
it says as brought to its attention by
 
05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
the office personnel legislators it goes
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
on and i was just wondering if there was
 
05:42:19.990 --> 05:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
a reason why members of the public was
 
05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
not included in that list not membership
 
05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
i would just say that
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
as with health and human services
 
05:42:33.910 --> 05:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
oversight committee members of the
 
05:42:35.910 --> 05:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
public obviously can
 
05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
attend listen and hear the
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
reasonings what have you for
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
whatever interactions they're examining
 
05:42:48.070 --> 05:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
they also examine
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
interactions between health care
 
05:42:50.000 --> 05:42:51.270 align:start position:0%
interactions between health care
providers

05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the agencies of the state
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
just a brief follow-up if i may
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i i know it's a public hearing and
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
they could attend but my question was
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
that they could be people would be
 
05:43:02.788 --> 05:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
recognized as people who could bring
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
issues before the committee that was
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i'm
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
05:43:18.070 --> 05:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
i have my my concern
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:43:20.558 --> 05:43:21.670 align:start position:0%
is that
you're

05:43:21.670 --> 05:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
am i understanding this correctly that
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee
 
05:43:30.310 --> 05:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
would not sunset would just be permanent
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
now there is
 
05:43:35.350 --> 05:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
a sunset provision
 
05:43:37.270 --> 05:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
part of the repeal
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
that you see um line five
 
05:43:42.470 --> 05:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
is due to sunset
 
05:43:46.548 --> 05:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
under the effective date paragraph 2
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
sun sets january 1st of 2028
 
05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
so it would have a five-year life span
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
and if
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee determines that
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
there is enough reason to continue
 
05:44:07.430 --> 05:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature could choose to do that
 
05:44:09.430 --> 05:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
but right now it's built in with a five
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:13.280 --> 05:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:44:14.390 --> 05:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
so the oversight committee would run
 
05:44:21.030 --> 05:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
the study committee and the
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee would run in tandem
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
are they the same people no no i believe
 
05:44:30.958 --> 05:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
are they the same people no no i believe
the

05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
we need to add a repeal of the study
 
05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee after it issues its final
 
05:44:40.390 --> 05:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
report in november of 2020 okay that's
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
my confusion that would be the
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do it okay thank you
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
yeah as i stated that's why
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
we made the effective date of the
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee january of 2023
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
because the study committee technically
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
is supposed to do
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
a report on november 2022
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
and then a final report november of 2023
 
05:45:09.110 --> 05:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
but if the oversight committee has
 
05:45:09.120 --> 05:45:10.470 align:start position:0%
but if the oversight committee has
issues

05:45:10.470 --> 05:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
that were put forward by the report on
 
05:45:13.600 --> 05:45:14.670 align:start position:0%
that were put forward by the report on
november

05:45:14.670 --> 05:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
november
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
2022 they could begin looking at those
 
05:45:17.920 --> 05:45:23.750 align:start position:0%
2022 they could begin looking at those
issues

05:45:23.750 --> 05:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to take representatives
 
05:45:34.230 --> 05:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
lucas's of um suggestion to include
 
05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
would that not cause confusion as to
 
05:45:42.868 --> 05:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
what the lines of communications are
 
05:45:42.878 --> 05:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
what the lines of communications are
because

05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:45:46.230 --> 05:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
is the public now
 
05:45:47.990 --> 05:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
oplc with their complaints and this this
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
ca if i understand correctly
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee is just to
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
discuss the issues between the board
 
05:46:00.070 --> 05:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
and the director it's not
 
05:46:03.990 --> 05:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
the function of the oplc is that correct
 
05:46:04.000 --> 05:46:05.270 align:start position:0%
the function of the oplc is that correct
okay

05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's my intent
 
05:46:08.230 --> 05:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
yes we
 
05:46:09.990 --> 05:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed this year we had a
 
05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
number of bills dealing with the
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
relationships of the boards and the oplc
 
05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
and we decided that since the op has
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
become larger and larger
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
that that's something we ought to keep
 
05:46:28.548 --> 05:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:30.150 --> 05:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:46:32.230 --> 05:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions comments
 
05:46:32.240 --> 05:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions comments
concerns

05:46:35.750 --> 05:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:37.590 --> 05:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
i would state that if
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
the committee chooses
 
05:46:41.910 --> 05:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
we could
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
change line 12 just delete line 12 and
 
05:46:46.000 --> 05:46:47.350 align:start position:0%
change line 12 just delete line 12 and
leave

05:46:47.350 --> 05:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
leave
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
november of 2022 as the
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.948 --> 05:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
i believe we could make that change
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
without a major um
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.000 --> 05:47:10.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:47:10.628 --> 05:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions for representative schuett
 
05:47:18.070 --> 05:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative psychic
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
is there a second amendment
 
05:47:22.708 --> 05:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
for the boxing and wrestling
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
there is a second amendment which
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
basically mirrors 14 24
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the exception it deletes the boxing
 
05:47:33.430 --> 05:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
and wrestling commission
 
05:47:35.670 --> 05:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
which we sort of took a straw poll
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
before if you'll recall that
 
05:47:40.470 --> 05:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
this committee agreed that that should
 
05:47:44.310 --> 05:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
not be regulated by oplc
 
05:47:46.548 --> 05:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
that's the only change and that's the
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
one that will will be presented at the
 
05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
05:47:50.000 --> 05:47:51.510 align:start position:0%
executive session
with

05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's we will only see one amendment at
 
05:47:55.590 --> 05:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
the executive session yes okay all right
 
05:47:57.670 --> 05:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's all i we don't usually have two
 
05:47:57.680 --> 05:47:58.708 align:start position:0%
that's all i we don't usually have two
inventions

05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
inventions
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
it's simpler if we don't yes
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:48:04.310 --> 05:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
05:48:06.948 --> 05:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
schuett uh rep
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
director li cartney wishes just to speak
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney executive director oplc
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh oplc certainly doesn't take a
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
position um
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
or on this amendment rather
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
and for the record i'm looking at one
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
four two four
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
um we
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know being at oplc the last couple
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
years it's been a little bit like
 
05:48:45.750 --> 05:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
building an airplane while flying um
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
so i certainly you know would welcome
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
the input and i think the members of the
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee who would serve on this would
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
certainly i think find it
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
enlightening as to how
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
is currently working in new hampshire
 
05:49:06.548 --> 05:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
my only question or observation is
 
05:49:06.558 --> 05:49:08.070 align:start position:0%
my only question or observation is
really

05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:49:08.080 --> 05:49:08.948 align:start position:0%
really
is

05:49:08.948 --> 05:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not the scope of the
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee's work is sufficiently broad
 
05:49:15.190 --> 05:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
i know that the committee throughout the
 
05:49:17.190 --> 05:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
legislative session heard probably some
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
grumblings and complaints from
 
05:49:18.958 --> 05:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
grumblings and complaints from
stakeholders

05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
we've been strategic in trying not to
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
complain uh you know
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
regarding boards we have a good
 
05:49:32.230 --> 05:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
relationship with the majority of them
 
05:49:34.708 --> 05:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
for example should oplc be able to bring
 
05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
issues to the to this oversight
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee regarding boards
 
05:49:41.760 --> 05:49:42.948 align:start position:0%
committee regarding boards
um

05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
true story
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know if a board is uh facilitating
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
the commission of a crime
 
05:49:52.868 --> 05:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
and declines to do anything when that's
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
brought to their attention
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
is that something that we should be able
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
to bring to the to this oversight
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
committee's attention
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
as it's currently drafted it just says
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
the committee shall provide legislative
 
05:50:05.830 --> 05:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
oversight and informational meetings on
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
the policies and rules of the office
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
i guess my suggestion would be to make
 
05:50:12.868 --> 05:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
it clear that if
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
that if oplc observes
 
05:50:15.440 --> 05:50:17.110 align:start position:0%
that if oplc observes
concerns

05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
that we'd be able to bring that to the
 
05:50:20.230 --> 05:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
oversight committee's attention but
 
05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
certainly um we don't take a position on
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
this and you know if assume this passes
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
we look forward to working with the
 
05:50:26.958 --> 05:50:28.230 align:start position:0%
we look forward to working with the
committee

05:50:28.230 --> 05:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd be happy to answer any
 
05:50:29.520 --> 05:50:31.590 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd be happy to answer any
questions

05:50:31.590 --> 05:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i would hope that if there
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
is a crime being committed you're
 
05:50:37.270 --> 05:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
reporting it to the appropriate
 
05:50:37.280 --> 05:50:38.628 align:start position:0%
reporting it to the appropriate
authorities

05:50:38.628 --> 05:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
um i did
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:43.510 --> 05:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt has a question
 
05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
oh that was going to be my suggestion i
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
thought we already had an attorney
 
05:50:48.868 --> 05:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
general's office to handle that kind of
 
05:50:48.878 --> 05:50:51.990 align:start position:0%
general's office to handle that kind of
thing

05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:53.910 --> 05:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes whether or not
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
people exercise their discretion to
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
prosecute cases is a separate matter you
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
know but i think it from a structural
 
05:51:00.000 --> 05:51:01.190 align:start position:0%
know but i think it from a structural
standpoint

05:51:01.190 --> 05:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
05:51:02.948 --> 05:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
there are you know by and large our
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
board members have very good intentions
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
i think the problem with the offices
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
have always been um and with the boards
 
05:51:11.510 --> 05:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a lack of internal controls
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a comp you know there has
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
been um a lack of an inventory over what
 
05:51:18.628 --> 05:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
the statutory regulatory requirements
 
05:51:18.638 --> 05:51:19.350 align:start position:0%
the statutory regulatory requirements
are

05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:51:19.360 --> 05:51:21.110 align:start position:0%
are
um

05:51:21.110 --> 05:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
the boards and the office historically
 
05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
have just regulated based on how they've
 
05:51:27.510 --> 05:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
always regulated without regard to what
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
the statute actually requires which is
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
why it's part of our plan to establish
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
internal controls but so i think that's
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
why we've gotten into a situation where
 
05:51:37.110 --> 05:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
we stumble upon issues like this
 
05:51:39.190 --> 05:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
and even with best intentions you know
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
there are a decent number of
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
legal issues out there that i would
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
think would be appropriate to bring to
 
05:51:48.868 --> 05:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.878 --> 05:51:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:51:50.470 --> 05:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:51:50.480 --> 05:51:51.190 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
i i i do understand that there's a
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
difference between things which are
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
illegal and things which are crimes uh
 
05:51:59.590 --> 05:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
and and certainly that's one of the
 
05:52:02.788 --> 05:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
advantages of this commit news oversight
 
05:52:05.190 --> 05:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee is to try to sort some of this
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
out because otherwise you're just doing
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
too much
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh all by yourself and without enough
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:17.590 --> 05:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any other
 
05:52:17.600 --> 05:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any other
questions

05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:52:19.680 --> 05:52:20.830 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
bailey do i understand it say that you'd
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
like it to flow both ways it's not just
 
05:52:28.230 --> 05:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
us overseeing you you would like to be
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
able to have us oversee these boards if
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
you get into trouble with them
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
correct because
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
correct representative because i mean
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
i know that um the boards i shouldn't
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
say all of them but several of them may
 
05:52:43.510 --> 05:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
feel differently but if you actually
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
look at oplc's authority it's it's quite
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
limited and if you look at the board's
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
authority it's generally not limited
 
05:52:52.948 --> 05:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
they have uh
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know oftentimes full discretion uh
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
to regulate um what happens in their
 
05:52:57.200 --> 05:52:58.390 align:start position:0%
to regulate um what happens in their
profession

05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
profession
 
05:52:58.400 --> 05:52:59.430 align:start position:0%
profession
um

05:52:59.430 --> 05:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
so i you know there are there are thing
 
05:53:04.470 --> 05:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think that that uh that it should go
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
both ways um i think that for the most
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
part you know we've got 54 boards we've
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
got a good relationship with about 40 of
 
05:53:14.470 --> 05:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
them uh 15 of them you've probably heard
 
05:53:14.480 --> 05:53:15.270 align:start position:0%
them uh 15 of them you've probably heard
from

05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:53:15.280 --> 05:53:16.230 align:start position:0%
from
um

05:53:16.230 --> 05:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:16.240 --> 05:53:17.270 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
but i think that there could be
 
05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
improvements on both sides
 
05:53:23.270 --> 05:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.030 --> 05:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:30.310 --> 05:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
testify on this amendment to senate bill
 
05:53:34.160 --> 05:53:37.270 align:start position:0%
testify on this amendment to senate bill
330.

05:53:37.270 --> 05:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:39.990 --> 05:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing anyone
 
05:53:42.548 --> 05:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing will resume at
 
05:53:42.558 --> 05:53:43.430 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing will resume at
three

05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:53:50.310 --> 05:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:12.310 --> 05:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
did she know of any other boards that
 
05:54:15.270 --> 05:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
did this
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh she's not saying
 
05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
oh she said yes there's there's a few of
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
the very old board
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
that are
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
um that have that author and he's gonna
 
05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.600 --> 05:54:28.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
i wonder if it's ever been used
 
05:54:31.600 --> 05:54:34.708 align:start position:0%
i wonder if it's ever been used
well

05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:40.470 --> 05:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:40.480 --> 05:54:54.948 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:57.270 --> 05:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
you won't be offended yeah well
 
05:55:01.350 --> 05:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
one or the other nice to hear how mike's
 
05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
doing yeah that would be nice i hope
 
05:55:08.948 --> 05:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.270 --> 05:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh yeah right right i have found
 
05:56:38.948 --> 05:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
by the way that there are other boards
 
05:56:40.708 --> 05:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
that can do the
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
what i have just done
 
05:56:44.070 --> 05:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
she said
 
05:56:47.830 --> 05:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
not most hold on some of the old boards
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that i'm
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
that i like this the fact that there's a
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
i would i voted again
 
05:56:54.878 --> 06:01:22.230 align:start position:0%
i would i voted again
thanks

06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%

the case management agencies do not

federal regulation prohibits them from

doing so
 
06:03:39.750 --> 06:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
the department amended amendment is
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
problematic as it has unintended
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
consequences and the department
 
06:03:45.670 --> 06:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendment creates a substant a
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
substantive change from the practices of

the last 28 years without explanation as
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
to why this monumental change
 
06:03:55.270 --> 06:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
is being requested
 
06:03:57.910 --> 06:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me senator what department
 
06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%

06:04:03.350 --> 06:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
department so that that'll be coming i'm
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
pretty sure or
 
06:04:05.760 --> 06:04:07.190 align:start position:0%
pretty sure or
so

06:04:07.190 --> 06:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you yeah it should be noted
 
06:04:12.470 --> 06:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
that uh three of the uh three of the
 
06:04:14.470 --> 06:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
four from 1915

services which are not in compliance
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
with federal law which requires that the
 
06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
case management be provided
 
06:04:31.990 --> 06:04:32.000 align:start position:0%

the part the department amendment has
 
06:04:38.230 --> 06:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of limiting
 
06:04:40.230 --> 06:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
solutions before
 
06:04:41.430 --> 06:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
06:04:43.750 --> 06:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
is in place to resolve the deficiencies
 
06:04:45.910 --> 06:04:45.920 align:start position:0%

private insurance and private pay
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are significant significant cost
 
06:05:09.990 --> 06:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
savings which results from keeping our
 
06:05:13.510 --> 06:05:13.520 align:start position:0%

do i understand you correctly to say
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
that this operation has been proceeding
 
06:07:04.708 --> 06:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
until hhs changed their rules
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
and now
 
06:07:05.760 --> 06:07:07.590 align:start position:0%
and now
the

06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%

do not comply with the rules

uh my name is jeb curlop i'm with life
 
06:09:20.868 --> 06:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
coping case management we're as a case
 
06:09:22.788 --> 06:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
management agency located in nashville
 
06:09:24.868 --> 06:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
we provide case management
 
06:09:27.270 --> 06:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of new hampshire
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
life coping is an independent
 
06:09:29.440 --> 06:09:30.948 align:start position:0%
life coping is an independent

06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management agency
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
which means we only provide case
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
management services to our clients
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
we do not provide any direct services to
 
06:09:39.600 --> 06:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
we do not provide any direct services to
them

06:09:40.470 --> 06:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
rather we conduct a comprehensive needs
 
06:09:44.390 --> 06:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
assessment of the patient's clinical and
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
non-medic non-clinical needs develop a
 
06:09:49.590 --> 06:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
care plan and help find the appropriate
 
06:09:51.350 --> 06:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
06:09:53.590 --> 06:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
the case management we provide is a
 
06:09:55.990 --> 06:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
health care service specifically home
 
06:09:58.470 --> 06:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
and community-based care for the elderly
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
and chronically ill who are eligible for
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
a nursing home level of care so these
 
06:10:04.948 --> 06:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
individuals would be in a nursing home
 
06:10:04.958 --> 06:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
individuals would be in a nursing home
otherwise

06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
06:10:08.708 --> 06:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
case management agencies have many
 
06:10:11.190 --> 06:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
nurses and social workers on staff who
 
06:10:13.350 --> 06:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
regularly assess their clients medical
 
06:10:15.750 --> 06:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
and non-medical needs and coordinate
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
their care so that they can safely live
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
at home
 
06:10:20.548 --> 06:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
life coping serves clients who are
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for services under medicaid
 
06:10:26.150 --> 06:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
waiver programs specifically choices for
 
06:10:26.160 --> 06:10:28.390 align:start position:0%
waiver programs specifically choices for
independence

06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
independence
 
06:10:30.548 --> 06:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities acquired
 
06:10:38.470 --> 06:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
so sb 333
 
06:10:42.708 --> 06:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
is really intended just to be a very
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
simple housekeeping bill
 
06:10:46.708 --> 06:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
the issue is that
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
from our understanding hhs has recently
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
taken the position that their statutory
 
06:10:54.150 --> 06:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
authority to license case management
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
agencies needs to be clarified um this
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
came as a surprise to us because hhs as
 
06:11:01.830 --> 06:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
you've heard from senator avart has been
 
06:11:04.470 --> 06:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
licensing live coping and similar case
 
06:11:07.510 --> 06:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
management agencies for nearly 30 years
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 151
 
06:11:12.470 --> 06:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
colon to b
 
06:11:14.708 --> 06:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
as well as hhs rules
 
06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
to carry that out sp 333 is simply meant
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify the department's authority to
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
continue licensing case management
 
06:11:24.548 --> 06:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
agencies and really essentially maintain
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
the status quo
 
06:11:28.948 --> 06:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
life coping fully supports licensing of
 
06:11:30.948 --> 06:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
case management agencies
 
06:11:33.270 --> 06:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
from our perspective it ensures critical
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
consumer protections and quality of care
 
06:11:38.230 --> 06:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
for vulnerable populations that the case
 
06:11:40.868 --> 06:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
management agencies serve
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
again those are elderly and disabled who
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
would otherwise
 
06:11:45.990 --> 06:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for a nursing home
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
level of care
 
06:11:47.600 --> 06:11:48.628 align:start position:0%
level of care
but

06:11:48.628 --> 06:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:11:50.470 --> 06:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
are able to stay in their homes and in
 
06:11:52.150 --> 06:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
licensure also ensures that case
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
management agencies are held to the same
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
high standards that are applied to other
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
health care providers
 
06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
and it protects new hampshire's federal
 
06:12:04.150 --> 06:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
matching funds
 
06:12:05.910 --> 06:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
it also allows a certain case man
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
certain case management agencies to be
 
06:12:10.390 --> 06:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for critical federal funds
 
06:12:13.030 --> 06:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
federal grants um so we would like to
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
explain uh from our perspective where we
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
stand with the law um and the rules
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
so rsa 151 is the residential care and
 
06:12:26.230 --> 06:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
health facility licensing statute
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
the phrase case management agencies is
 
06:12:31.990 --> 06:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
only explicitly mentioned
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
in rsa 151 colon 5 which is the section
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
where license fees are listed
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
the phrase case management agencies is
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
not explicitly listed by name in the
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
list of entities that appear under
 
06:12:49.830 --> 06:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 151 colon 2 which is the section
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
about license or registration required
 
06:12:53.600 --> 06:12:54.390 align:start position:0%
about license or registration required
however

06:12:54.390 --> 06:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:12:56.788 --> 06:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
case management agencies are implicitly
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
listed there specifically under rsa 151
 
06:13:02.708 --> 06:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
colon 2
 
06:13:05.190 --> 06:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
roman 1 parentheses b
 
06:13:07.030 --> 06:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
which refers to
 
06:13:09.910 --> 06:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
quote home health care providers as
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
defined in the later part of the statute
 
06:13:14.708 --> 06:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
151 colon
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
2 dash b
 
06:13:18.548 --> 06:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
and when you go and read that definition
 
06:13:23.110 --> 06:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
in rsa 151 colon 2 dash b it reads and i
 
06:13:23.120 --> 06:13:24.150 align:start position:0%
in rsa 151 colon 2 dash b it reads and i
quote

06:13:24.150 --> 06:13:24.160 align:start position:0%

06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
home healthcare provider means any

organization business entity or

subdivision thereof whether public or
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
private whether operated for profit or
 
06:13:36.150 --> 06:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
not which is engaged in arranging

arranging or providing directly or
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
through contract arrangement one or more
 
06:13:42.150 --> 06:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
of the following and then there is a
 
06:13:44.948 --> 06:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
list of services that
 
06:13:47.830 --> 06:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
clients patients could be eligible for
 
06:13:50.150 --> 06:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
so case management agencies like life
 
06:13:52.628 --> 06:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
coping are a business entity which is
 
06:13:55.510 --> 06:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
engaged in arranging one or more of the
 
06:13:58.868 --> 06:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
listed services that their clients need
 
06:14:01.110 --> 06:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
case management agencies have and should
 
06:14:03.270 --> 06:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
continue to fall within the definition
 
06:14:06.070 --> 06:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
of home health care provider and the
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
licensing authority
 
06:14:08.558 --> 06:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
licensing authority
there

06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:14:11.350 --> 06:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
at one point life's coping's licensing
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
application actually referenced home
 
06:14:23.750 --> 06:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:23.760 --> 06:14:24.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:26.708 --> 06:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
and you heard earlier senator avard
 
06:14:28.868 --> 06:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
06:14:31.910 --> 06:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
the rule it's our understanding that
 
06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
hep 819
 
06:14:36.310 --> 06:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
which is relative to case management
 
06:14:39.030 --> 06:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
agencies used to reference
 
06:14:42.948 --> 06:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
151 colon 2-b and however at some point
 
06:14:44.788 --> 06:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
along the way the rule was changed an
 
06:14:46.948 --> 06:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
error was made and it now
 
06:14:48.788 --> 06:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
states that a license to operate a case
 
06:14:51.910 --> 06:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
management agency is pursuant to 151
 
06:14:54.868 --> 06:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
colon 2 roman 1f which is a reference to
 
06:14:56.948 --> 06:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
adult daycare services and that's
 
06:15:01.270 --> 06:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
clearly wrong we don't know why
 
06:15:02.788 --> 06:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
you may hear that case management
 
06:15:04.628 --> 06:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
agencies have not been licensed or
 
06:15:07.030 --> 06:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
should not be licensed under home health
 
06:15:10.310 --> 06:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
the home health care provider statute
 
06:15:12.628 --> 06:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
and we would like to share three items
 
06:15:14.070 --> 06:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
with you that demonstrate that case
 
06:15:16.230 --> 06:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
management agencies have been licensed
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
under the home health care statute and
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
should continue to be
 
06:15:21.110 --> 06:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
licensed under the home health care
 
06:15:21.120 --> 06:15:22.230 align:start position:0%
licensed under the home health care
statute

06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:15:24.150 --> 06:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
which again this simple fix is simply
 
06:15:25.830 --> 06:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
meant to clarify
 
06:15:29.030 --> 06:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the handouts i gave to you
 
06:15:30.788 --> 06:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
first is that in
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
department rules he 805
 
06:15:38.868 --> 06:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
it defines case management agency as an
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
agency that is licensed in accordance
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
with rsa 151 colon 2
 
06:15:47.670 --> 06:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
roman 1 parentheses b and again that's
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
the law that says license is required
 
06:15:54.150 --> 06:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.990 --> 06:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
secondly another piece of evidence that
 
06:15:57.430 --> 06:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
we have been
 
06:15:59.110 --> 06:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
and should continue to be
 
06:16:01.270 --> 06:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
licensed under home health care is that
 
06:16:04.390 --> 06:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
in march of 2021 a report was issued by
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
06:16:07.030 --> 06:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
services about findings and
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations on new hampshire's
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services for
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
seniors and individuals with physical
 
06:16:16.310 --> 06:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the report reads and i
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
quote consider contracting with case
 
06:16:21.670 --> 06:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
management entities directly rather than
 
06:16:24.150 --> 06:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
having them licensed as home care
 
06:16:24.160 --> 06:16:25.590 align:start position:0%
having them licensed as home care
providers

06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
providers
 
06:16:27.350 --> 06:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
through the standard medicaid provider
 
06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment process so that is straight
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the department report
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
licensed as home care providers
 
06:16:37.910 --> 06:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and finally a third piece of evidence is
 
06:16:40.470 --> 06:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
that case management agencies um
 
06:16:42.470 --> 06:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they have been licensed under the
 
06:16:46.230 --> 06:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
home health care statute is in hep
 
06:16:49.830 --> 06:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
819 those rules say that licensed case
 
06:16:52.150 --> 06:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
management agencies must comply with the
 
06:16:55.110 --> 06:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
home care clients bill of rights which
 
06:16:57.590 --> 06:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
is set forth in 151
 
06:16:59.350 --> 06:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
colon 21b
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
and when you read that statute it says
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
that these client rights apply
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
only to services delivered by or on
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of a home health care provider
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
so this is yet further evidence that
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
case management agencies are licensed
 
06:17:15.910 --> 06:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
under the home health care provider
 
06:17:15.920 --> 06:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
under the home health care provider
statute

06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:17:21.030 --> 06:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
so in summary sb 333 as amended by the
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
senate simply adds case management
 
06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
agencies explicitly to the definition of
 
06:17:28.230 --> 06:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
home health care providers in order to
 
06:17:31.270 --> 06:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
clarify that hhs does indeed have the
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to license case
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
management agencies
 
06:17:38.310 --> 06:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
under this under that statute
 
06:17:40.390 --> 06:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
this in our opinion will preserve the
 
06:17:42.548 --> 06:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
status quo with respect to licensing of
 
06:17:44.548 --> 06:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
case management agencies
 
06:17:46.470 --> 06:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
that serve individuals covered by
 
06:17:49.270 --> 06:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid as well as by private insurance
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
and private
 
06:17:52.708 --> 06:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
self-pay patients
 
06:17:54.628 --> 06:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
we thank you for your time and your
 
06:17:56.788 --> 06:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
consideration and we respectfully ask
 
06:17:59.750 --> 06:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
for your support of sb 333 as amended by
 
06:18:01.350 --> 06:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
06:18:06.788 --> 06:18:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:10.470 --> 06:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i'm i'm hope hoping
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting the part about why the
 
06:18:18.708 --> 06:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
case manager
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the distinction
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
between case management service provider
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
and case management agency and i also
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
don't understand why
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment to add case
 
06:18:32.638 --> 06:18:34.470 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment to add case
management

06:18:34.470 --> 06:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
management
 
06:18:37.590 --> 06:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
in that existing paragraph that begins
 
06:18:40.230 --> 06:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
with home health care's
 
06:18:42.070 --> 06:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
providers and why it's why case
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
management doesn't have its own little
 
06:18:43.680 --> 06:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
management doesn't have its own little
paragraph

06:18:45.510 --> 06:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
right so i think um the case management
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
services provider and case management
 
06:18:51.430 --> 06:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
agencies is probably one in the same i
 
06:18:52.868 --> 06:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
06:18:55.990 --> 06:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think it is one in the same um and to
 
06:18:59.110 --> 06:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
answer your second question
 
06:19:01.510 --> 06:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
we that's where we have been
 
06:19:03.350 --> 06:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's the in our opinion that's where
 
06:19:05.910 --> 06:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
the authority has come from
 
06:19:08.390 --> 06:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
to license case management service
 
06:19:10.310 --> 06:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
providers or case management agencies it
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
has come from this authority
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
um to license home health care providers
 
06:19:16.080 --> 06:19:17.430 align:start position:0%
um to license home health care providers
and

06:19:17.430 --> 06:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:18.548 --> 06:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
06:19:20.548 --> 06:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
this information that i was just going
 
06:19:20.558 --> 06:19:21.910 align:start position:0%
this information that i was just going
through

06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:19:21.920 --> 06:19:23.910 align:start position:0%
through
where

06:19:23.910 --> 06:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:19:25.190 --> 06:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of pieces of
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:31.830 --> 06:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
kind of supporting supporting that and
 
06:19:33.270 --> 06:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
06:19:35.190 --> 06:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
from our perspective
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
we you know life coping is a
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
business entity
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
a private business entity
 
06:19:45.190 --> 06:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
which is engaged in arranging
 
06:19:47.590 --> 06:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh through contract arrangement one or
 
06:19:50.070 --> 06:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
more of the following services for our
 
06:19:51.990 --> 06:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
clients so that
 
06:19:54.468 --> 06:19:54.478 align:start position:0%
language we think that that's been there
 
06:19:56.468 --> 06:19:56.478 align:start position:0%
that that's where we think
 
06:19:58.230 --> 06:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
the authority comes from but the
 
06:20:00.390 --> 06:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
department is saying that it's
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
not clear and so we are simply proposing
 
06:20:05.830 --> 06:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
to add including case management
 
06:20:09.910 --> 06:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.590 --> 06:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your your
 
06:20:14.310 --> 06:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
concern for clear clarity
 
06:20:16.468 --> 06:20:16.478 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions
 
06:20:20.548 --> 06:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:23.110 --> 06:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'll yield to you first but i'm sure
 
06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay yeah mike my concern is
 
06:20:27.670 --> 06:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:20:29.910 --> 06:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
h e
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
h e e 805 rules
 
06:20:36.548 --> 06:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
are five years old at this point but and
 
06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
the 819 rules are not yet online
 
06:20:43.510 --> 06:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering where uh
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
are they are they when were they passed
 
06:20:46.240 --> 06:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
are they are they when were they passed
um

06:20:50.070 --> 06:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:53.430 --> 06:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the h19 rules
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:58.878 --> 06:21:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:21:02.070 --> 06:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:02.080 --> 06:21:02.948 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:21:02.948 --> 06:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:21:05.110 --> 06:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
so they are they're not new okay i don't
 
06:21:08.868 --> 06:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
know they're so mike my concern then is
 
06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
what's happening now that causes
 
06:21:15.510 --> 06:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
that that causes the need for this why
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
if the
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
one set of rules is
 
06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
five years old and another one is nine
 
06:21:22.708 --> 06:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
years old
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's a great question madam chair so
 
06:21:31.430 --> 06:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
06:21:34.230 --> 06:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation last
 
06:21:35.910 --> 06:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:21:37.750 --> 06:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
which ultimately
 
06:21:41.750 --> 06:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
a provision went into sb 162
 
06:21:41.760 --> 06:21:42.708 align:start position:0%
a provision went into sb 162
which

06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
initially started out as a
 
06:21:45.120 --> 06:21:46.390 align:start position:0%
initially started out as a
discussion discussion

06:21:46.390 --> 06:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
discussion discussion
 
06:21:47.910 --> 06:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a discussion about
 
06:21:50.070 --> 06:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
talking about homeless shelter case
 
06:21:50.080 --> 06:21:51.270 align:start position:0%
talking about homeless shelter case
management

06:21:51.270 --> 06:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
management
 
06:21:54.230 --> 06:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
um ultimately when it got put into sp
 
06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
162 it was
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
kind of watered down and talked more
 
06:21:59.910 --> 06:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
just about
 
06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
talking about licensing of case
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
management and the department under that
 
06:22:08.230 --> 06:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
law was supposed to hold some
 
06:22:10.070 --> 06:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder meetings
 
06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
and we actually only had one that was
 
06:22:15.110 --> 06:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
held in the fall the early fall with the
 
06:22:18.468 --> 06:22:18.478 align:start position:0%
department and it was at on that zoom
 
06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
call that we learned that the department
 
06:22:24.310 --> 06:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
felt like they were lacking
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to license case
 
06:22:29.190 --> 06:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
management agencies and as i said
 
06:22:31.750 --> 06:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
when i began my testimony that was quite
 
06:22:34.628 --> 06:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
a surprise to us because
 
06:22:36.868 --> 06:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
we have been licensed for
 
06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 28 years
 
06:22:39.120 --> 06:22:40.548 align:start position:0%
approximately 28 years
and

06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
these rules are not new rules
 
06:22:42.558 --> 06:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
these rules are not new rules
okay

06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:22:43.440 --> 06:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
okay
and

06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:47.350 --> 06:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
all right so oh actually if it's if it
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
was from 2013
 
06:22:52.150 --> 06:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
i mean that would imply that it's it's
 
06:22:54.150 --> 06:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
over nine years old and it's about to
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
expire next year so that's why it would
 
06:22:56.400 --> 06:22:57.510 align:start position:0%
expire next year so that's why it would
be

06:22:57.510 --> 06:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
coming up for a revision
 
06:23:00.000 --> 06:23:01.510 align:start position:0%
coming up for a revision
okay

06:23:01.510 --> 06:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:23:02.708 --> 06:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for clearing that up
 
06:23:06.070 --> 06:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:11.430 --> 06:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think that this was my my question was
 
06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
where does this kind of like hear a ball
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
start and it seems to me that
 
06:23:18.150 --> 06:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
it was with sb 162
 
06:23:21.350 --> 06:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
and an amendment that was
 
06:23:22.788 --> 06:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
not really
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
targeted that ended up not saying what
 
06:23:26.468 --> 06:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
it wanted to be and then therefore
 
06:23:29.190 --> 06:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
confused homeless shelter
 
06:23:30.948 --> 06:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
with case management is that what you're
 
06:23:30.958 --> 06:23:32.468 align:start position:0%
with case management is that what you're
saying

06:23:32.468 --> 06:23:32.478 align:start position:0%
saying
 
06:23:35.910 --> 06:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
initially in there was um
 
06:23:35.920 --> 06:23:37.430 align:start position:0%
initially in there was um
there

06:23:37.430 --> 06:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think it initially started out as
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
sb-140 but then ultimately the language
 
06:23:43.670 --> 06:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
was put into one sb 162 and there was
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
06:23:47.910 --> 06:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
the department getting funding for case
 
06:23:50.230 --> 06:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
management with respect to homeless
 
06:23:53.430 --> 06:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
shelters and the phrase case management
 
06:23:55.750 --> 06:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
kind of caught our attention given the
 
06:23:55.760 --> 06:23:57.510 align:start position:0%
kind of caught our attention given the
business

06:23:57.510 --> 06:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:23:57.520 --> 06:23:59.670 align:start position:0%
business
and

06:23:59.670 --> 06:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:01.910 --> 06:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
but ultimately when and so that i think
 
06:24:03.830 --> 06:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
initially at least our understanding was
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
there was supposed to be a discussion
 
06:24:07.030 --> 06:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
around case management in the context of
 
06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
homeless shelters but ultimately when it
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
went into sb-162 it was
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
to have a discussion just about case
 
06:24:20.150 --> 06:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
management licensing and that's when we
 
06:24:20.160 --> 06:24:21.190 align:start position:0%
management licensing and that's when we
had

06:24:21.190 --> 06:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
like i said a zoom call in early fall
 
06:24:24.788 --> 06:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
with the department and other
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and that's when we first
 
06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:30.000 --> 06:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
concern

06:24:31.190 --> 06:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
concern
 
06:24:32.868 --> 06:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
about feeling like they didn't have the
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:38.708 --> 06:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:24:41.110 --> 06:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
interesting any other questions
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:48.468 --> 06:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
so this is a little bit of a
 
06:24:53.910 --> 06:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
handful here to to grasp all this
 
06:24:57.430 --> 06:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
because it's a little bit about
 
06:24:59.430 --> 06:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
what just what you see is not what you
 
06:24:59.440 --> 06:25:00.230 align:start position:0%
what just what you see is not what you
get

06:25:00.230 --> 06:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:25:02.948 --> 06:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
anyway so um
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
has there been any further action
 
06:25:05.280 --> 06:25:06.628 align:start position:0%
has there been any further action
involving

06:25:06.628 --> 06:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
involving
 
06:25:10.788 --> 06:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:13.110 --> 06:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
no there i there's not there's nothing i
 
06:25:15.750 --> 06:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
mean the the case there is no court
 
06:25:18.868 --> 06:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
issues okay that that's the answer is no
 
06:25:18.878 --> 06:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
issues okay that that's the answer is no
um

06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:19.760 --> 06:25:22.150 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:22.160 --> 06:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:25:23.350 --> 06:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:25.430 --> 06:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
this homeless shelter thing it sounds
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
like that was kind of appended on to
 
06:25:31.030 --> 06:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the existing business that you've
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
been doing for a long long time
 
06:25:35.430 --> 06:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
the homeless shelter issue i think kind
 
06:25:37.350 --> 06:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
of got resolved
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
through other legislation so the
 
06:25:41.190 --> 06:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
department removed reference to case
 
06:25:42.788 --> 06:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
management around
 
06:25:46.708 --> 06:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
um homeless shelter and they got the um
 
06:25:48.708 --> 06:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
the allocation of money that they were
 
06:25:50.708 --> 06:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
looking for and so
 
06:25:52.868 --> 06:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
that went away that went away yes that
 
06:25:54.548 --> 06:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
went away okay so we don't have to worry
 
06:25:56.708 --> 06:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
about homeless shelters anymore correct
 
06:25:59.190 --> 06:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
in context of this bill
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up okay so
 
06:26:02.400 --> 06:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up okay so
um

06:26:03.750 --> 06:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:03.760 --> 06:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:26:05.030 --> 06:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
have you done any exploration with the
 
06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
with the feds because presumably if the
 
06:26:13.030 --> 06:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
agency if the department is saying we
 
06:26:14.868 --> 06:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have the authority to
 
06:26:17.110 --> 06:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
be doing this at all or adequate
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
authority or whatever
 
06:26:20.390 --> 06:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
then i would think that there would have
 
06:26:22.548 --> 06:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
been some inquiries with the feds to
 
06:26:25.350 --> 06:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
find out whether that was the case
 
06:26:27.910 --> 06:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
whether you were on sal you guys were on
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
solid ground
 
06:26:32.310 --> 06:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh or whether this was 28
 
06:26:34.390 --> 06:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
28 years of
 
06:26:35.990 --> 06:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
being done this way and it never should
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
have been done that way
 
06:26:39.990 --> 06:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
because that's kind of sounds to me like
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
06:26:43.190 --> 06:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the department is they're kind of
 
06:26:44.548 --> 06:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
saying we don't think we have the
 
06:26:46.230 --> 06:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
authority to do this
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
well i think the licensing is a critical
 
06:26:50.708 --> 06:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
piece you can hear me okay um i think
 
06:26:53.670 --> 06:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
the licensing is a critical piece um
 
06:26:56.468 --> 06:26:56.478 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons including
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire getting
 
06:27:01.110 --> 06:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
federal matching funds
 
06:27:02.868 --> 06:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
as well as as i mentioned in my
 
06:27:02.878 --> 06:27:04.310 align:start position:0%
as well as as i mentioned in my
testimony

06:27:04.310 --> 06:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
some of the case management agencies
 
06:27:09.190 --> 06:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
with their licensing that allow that's a
 
06:27:10.948 --> 06:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
criteria in order for them to be
 
06:27:13.830 --> 06:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal grant money
 
06:27:14.630 --> 06:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:27:14.640 --> 06:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
so um
[Music]

06:27:15.750 --> 06:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:27:15.760 --> 06:27:17.110 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:27:17.110 --> 06:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:18.788 --> 06:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
i think i don't think there's any
 
06:27:20.830 --> 06:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
06:27:24.150 --> 06:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
um the need and the authority for
 
06:27:24.160 --> 06:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
um the need and the authority for
licensing

06:27:25.510 --> 06:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's just that the department is looking
 
06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
at at rsa 151 and not seeing
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
explicit authority to license case
 
06:27:36.708 --> 06:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
management agencies and that was news to
 
06:27:38.150 --> 06:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
us because as i
 
06:27:40.390 --> 06:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
the paragraph i read to you it we've we
 
06:27:43.270 --> 06:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
do feel like we
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
qualify as a business entity
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
which is engaged in arranging
 
06:27:51.590 --> 06:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
through contract arrangement one of more
 
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the following services for the
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
clients we serve and we have been
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
licensed under that
 
06:27:59.200 --> 06:28:00.390 align:start position:0%
licensed under that
statute

06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:28:02.788 --> 06:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
for approximately 28 years so we were
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear of the department's
 
06:28:07.350 --> 06:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
concern but we think this this is really
 
06:28:10.390 --> 06:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
purely meant to be a housekeeping item
 
06:28:12.390 --> 06:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to just inserting
 
06:28:12.400 --> 06:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
with respect to just inserting
explicitly

06:28:13.830 --> 06:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
06:28:16.070 --> 06:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
the phrase including a case management
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
services provider to just make it
 
06:28:21.670 --> 06:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll
 
06:28:25.590 --> 06:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
stop asking questions for the moment and
 
06:28:28.150 --> 06:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
let some of my colleagues continue
 
06:28:29.910 --> 06:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative larkis
 
06:28:31.590 --> 06:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
so have you had uh consulted with the
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
department and uh you know
 
06:28:38.310 --> 06:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
with if we added this language would
 
06:28:40.150 --> 06:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
they feel comfortable that they have the
 
06:28:41.670 --> 06:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
authority to provide the licensing
 
06:28:43.350 --> 06:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
um the department is um
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think wants to put their the authority
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
in a
 
06:28:53.750 --> 06:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
different section of rsa 151
 
06:28:57.030 --> 06:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
and our concern with that is that
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
06:28:59.750 --> 06:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that it would have
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences given that we
 
06:29:04.390 --> 06:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
have been licensed under
 
06:29:04.400 --> 06:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
have been licensed under
um

06:29:05.750 --> 06:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:05.760 --> 06:29:07.830 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
06:29:19.510 --> 06:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
pull it up here
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the third example i gave before about
 
06:29:25.190 --> 06:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
the case management agencies are
 
06:29:26.708 --> 06:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
required to
 
06:29:29.350 --> 06:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
be compliant with home care clients bill
 
06:29:32.230 --> 06:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
of rights as an example the licensing
 
06:29:34.708 --> 06:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
rules require that but when you go back
 
06:29:37.030 --> 06:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
to the law you see that though that
 
06:29:39.110 --> 06:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
provision about compliance with home
 
06:29:41.430 --> 06:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
care clients bill of rights
 
06:29:44.548 --> 06:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
only applies to services delivered
 
06:29:45.910 --> 06:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
on our behalf
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
by or on behalf of the home health care
 
06:29:50.548 --> 06:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
provider and there are i think other
 
06:29:50.558 --> 06:29:52.070 align:start position:0%
provider and there are i think other
things

06:29:52.070 --> 06:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:29:54.390 --> 06:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
along those lines that we're concerned
 
06:29:56.628 --> 06:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
if we put the statutory authority
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
in a different place
 
06:30:00.628 --> 06:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
we would have unintended consequences
 
06:30:00.638 --> 06:30:01.750 align:start position:0%
we would have unintended consequences
follow-up

06:30:01.750 --> 06:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:30:04.150 --> 06:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay but they may prefer it somewhere
 
06:30:06.948 --> 06:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
else you may disagree that's fine but
 
06:30:09.190 --> 06:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
the question is if
 
06:30:11.270 --> 06:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill were passed
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any assurance from hhs that
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
they would be convinced that they have
 
06:30:16.948 --> 06:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
the authority to provide the licensing
 
06:30:19.030 --> 06:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
you want i do believe that it would
 
06:30:21.270 --> 06:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
clearly give them the authority yes but
 
06:30:23.510 --> 06:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
you follow up i mean you don't have that
 
06:30:25.430 --> 06:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
clearly from them
 
06:30:27.030 --> 06:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
06:30:28.948 --> 06:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
i don't have that from them okay thank
 
06:30:28.958 --> 06:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
i don't have that from them okay thank
you

06:30:31.910 --> 06:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:31.920 --> 06:30:32.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:30:36.868 --> 06:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
06:30:39.510 --> 06:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i
 
06:30:41.670 --> 06:30:41.680 align:start position:0%

06:30:46.948 --> 06:30:46.958 align:start position:0%

at gallagher callahan and gartrell i'm a
 
06:30:54.510 --> 06:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:56.868 --> 06:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
foreign yes
 
06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
and this is jeb curl up and he's the
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
what is your organization
 
06:31:02.948 --> 06:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
of life coping what is your organization
 
06:31:05.350 --> 06:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
organization is uh life coping or a case
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
management agency um
 
06:31:09.110 --> 06:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
we provide case management throughout
 
06:31:10.708 --> 06:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and have been
 
06:31:11.830 --> 06:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
06:31:13.110 --> 06:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
06:31:13.120 --> 06:31:14.150 align:start position:0%
30 years
um

06:31:14.150 --> 06:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:16.868 --> 06:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
this program that we work on that were
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the licensing none of this is um
 
06:31:22.150 --> 06:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't um really alien to the
 
06:31:24.548 --> 06:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
federal government these programs exist
 
06:31:26.708 --> 06:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
virtually through every of the 50 states
 
06:31:29.190 --> 06:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
in our country the purpose is to help
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
individuals to
 
06:31:33.190 --> 06:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
remain safely and independently at home
 
06:31:36.628 --> 06:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
with services and out of institutions so
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
this would be for nursing homes
 
06:31:41.350 --> 06:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
where you'd be keeping people at seventy
 
06:31:44.310 --> 06:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
to seventy five thousand dollars a year
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
with our program we'll keep them in the
 
06:31:47.670 --> 06:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
community for fifteen to twenty thousand
 
06:31:49.910 --> 06:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so you take that fifty
 
06:31:51.910 --> 06:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar savings multiply
 
06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
that by four thousand people and you've
 
06:31:56.070 --> 06:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
got several hundred million dollars a
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
year that you're saving
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
um this our agency's been licensed um
 
06:32:01.680 --> 06:32:02.390 align:start position:0%
um this our agency's been licensed um
for

06:32:02.390 --> 06:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:32:04.150 --> 06:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
06:32:06.948 --> 06:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
the um well the case management agencies
 
06:32:09.750 --> 06:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
have been licensed for the last 28 years
 
06:32:11.910 --> 06:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
we've got a copy of the license here
 
06:32:13.270 --> 06:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
06:32:16.548 --> 06:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
06:32:19.190 --> 06:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
um approval or authorization or
 
06:32:20.948 --> 06:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
authority or
 
06:32:23.110 --> 06:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is these programs are going on
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the united states every state
 
06:32:27.670 --> 06:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
has a program like this
 
06:32:30.548 --> 06:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
we came into this issue with with the
 
06:32:30.558 --> 06:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
we came into this issue with with the
department

06:32:31.830 --> 06:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:32:33.910 --> 06:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
when there was a
 
06:32:35.830 --> 06:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
rfp for
 
06:32:38.230 --> 06:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
case management and homeless shelters
 
06:32:40.150 --> 06:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
and then there was question about who
 
06:32:41.990 --> 06:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be providing the case management
 
06:32:44.468 --> 06:32:44.478 align:start position:0%
in the homeless shelters and then out of
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
that grew
 
06:32:47.430 --> 06:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
where we are today
 
06:32:49.110 --> 06:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
with the department saying that they
 
06:32:49.120 --> 06:32:50.150 align:start position:0%
with the department saying that they
don't

06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:32:52.788 --> 06:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
or may not have statutory authority to
 
06:32:55.350 --> 06:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
licensed case management agencies so
 
06:32:57.350 --> 06:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're saying that basically they have
 
06:33:00.708 --> 06:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
been licensing us for the last 28 years
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
um i've got our license right here we
 
06:33:05.510 --> 06:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
have the language that's in
 
06:33:09.030 --> 06:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the rsa as that refers to us under
 
06:33:12.548 --> 06:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
the home health care providers and it
 
06:33:13.910 --> 06:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
basically these are people who would be
 
06:33:16.390 --> 06:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
in nursing homes or they may previously
 
06:33:18.948 --> 06:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
they would have been in the laconia
 
06:33:18.958 --> 06:33:19.910 align:start position:0%
they would have been in the laconia
school

06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:33:21.750 --> 06:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
which was shut down
 
06:33:24.150 --> 06:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
years ago but it's helping these people
 
06:33:27.990 --> 06:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
to remain safely uh in the community for
 
06:33:30.708 --> 06:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
with well as far as cfi with great
 
06:33:32.948 --> 06:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
savings the state so
 
06:33:35.910 --> 06:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's not an alien or you know really uh
 
06:33:37.910 --> 06:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
unusual program these are going on
 
06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the united states
 
06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:33:48.868 --> 06:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
well i
 
06:33:50.788 --> 06:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer and i don't play one on
 
06:33:53.830 --> 06:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
tv either but i have some familiarity
 
06:33:56.948 --> 06:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
with a legal concept called latches
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
which says that if you've been doing
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
something for a long long long long time
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
you can't suddenly be deprived of the
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
right to continue to do that
 
06:34:07.440 --> 06:34:08.548 align:start position:0%
right to continue to do that
without

06:34:08.548 --> 06:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:34:08.558 --> 06:34:10.548 align:start position:0%
without
a

06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:34:12.548 --> 06:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
very good cause
 
06:34:12.558 --> 06:34:15.430 align:start position:0%
very good cause
so

06:34:15.430 --> 06:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:18.310 --> 06:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
is that some aspect that you've explored
 
06:34:18.320 --> 06:34:20.830 align:start position:0%
is that some aspect that you've explored
especially

06:34:20.830 --> 06:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
especially
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:29.030 --> 06:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have not um no i mean i think
 
06:34:31.430 --> 06:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think there's consensus that we should
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
i hope there's consensus that we should
 
06:34:35.430 --> 06:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
continue to be licensed as we have been
 
06:34:38.868 --> 06:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's just cl literally a house in from
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
our perspective a housekeeping item to
 
06:34:44.708 --> 06:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
just be very explicit in the law rather
 
06:34:47.350 --> 06:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
than having to read the words that i
 
06:34:49.190 --> 06:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
read to you earlier where you kind of
 
06:34:51.190 --> 06:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
have to piece together
 
06:34:53.590 --> 06:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
out of that out of that paragraph
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
how we fall into it
 
06:34:56.628 --> 06:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
and i just did want to mention there was
 
06:34:58.468 --> 06:34:58.478 align:start position:0%
reference to the license and that is
 
06:35:01.110 --> 06:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
included in the testimony that we handed
 
06:35:02.468 --> 06:35:02.478 align:start position:0%
in to the committee
 
06:35:05.110 --> 06:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions represent
 
06:35:05.120 --> 06:35:06.150 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions represent
fellows

06:35:06.150 --> 06:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
06:35:09.190 --> 06:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair i i i didn't
 
06:35:11.670 --> 06:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
actually even get to my question
 
06:35:14.070 --> 06:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
so my question was i was trying to find
 
06:35:17.110 --> 06:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
out you know so you are um a case you do
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
case case management services
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
do you also provide home health care
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
services you know such as sending an aid
 
06:35:29.350 --> 06:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
to the home and
 
06:35:31.510 --> 06:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
or do you do you only
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
06:35:35.830 --> 06:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
other places for the actual service
 
06:35:35.840 --> 06:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
other places for the actual service
provision

06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:35:40.390 --> 06:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
excellent question um we are a a
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management agency
 
06:35:44.948 --> 06:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
which means that we
 
06:35:46.948 --> 06:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
provide exclusively case management
 
06:35:46.958 --> 06:35:48.150 align:start position:0%
provide exclusively case management
services

06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
and we do not provide any direct
 
06:35:52.868 --> 06:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
services so i'm not deciding what
 
06:35:55.270 --> 06:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
services your mother may need and then
 
06:35:57.830 --> 06:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
providing those services and
 
06:35:59.030 --> 06:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that the federal
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
government and actually the state of new
 
06:36:03.590 --> 06:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire is in on the process of a
 
06:36:05.990 --> 06:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan for conflict-free
 
06:36:08.788 --> 06:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
case management um and that that's of
 
06:36:11.350 --> 06:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
really um actually um a very good point
 
06:36:15.350 --> 06:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of what might be just totally a
 
06:36:17.990 --> 06:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
a consequence of uh
 
06:36:18.000 --> 06:36:19.270 align:start position:0%
a consequence of uh
what

06:36:19.270 --> 06:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:36:21.990 --> 06:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
not licensing case management would do
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
and basically the state is being
 
06:36:25.670 --> 06:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
assisted now with its
 
06:36:28.070 --> 06:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management plan as a
 
06:36:29.990 --> 06:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
result of having i think new hampshire's
 
06:36:31.750 --> 06:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're a unique state and that we do
 
06:36:33.350 --> 06:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
have independent case management
 
06:36:36.310 --> 06:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and many states don't and many
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
states are are
 
06:36:39.910 --> 06:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
are struggling with this whole concept
 
06:36:42.708 --> 06:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
of the conflict that you alluded to so
 
06:36:43.990 --> 06:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you that's an excellent
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
question i hope i've
 
06:36:47.830 --> 06:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
answered it
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:36:53.110 --> 06:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
ms kroll would be fair to say that
 
06:36:53.120 --> 06:36:54.390 align:start position:0%
ms kroll would be fair to say that
the

06:36:54.390 --> 06:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:36:56.468 --> 06:36:56.478 align:start position:0%
819 rules on
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
case management are expiring in january
 
06:37:00.000 --> 06:37:01.110 align:start position:0%
case management are expiring in january
is

06:37:01.110 --> 06:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:37:03.030 --> 06:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
is the
 
06:37:03.040 --> 06:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
is the
department's

06:37:06.070 --> 06:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:08.708 --> 06:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
is departments concerned part of their
 
06:37:12.708 --> 06:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:15.030 --> 06:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
or do you know anything about these i i
 
06:37:16.628 --> 06:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them madam chair
 
06:37:19.190 --> 06:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough i shouldn't have asked
 
06:37:21.430 --> 06:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:37:24.070 --> 06:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:37:24.080 --> 06:37:25.670 align:start position:0%

06:37:25.670 --> 06:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:37:39.270 --> 06:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and committee members
 
06:37:45.510 --> 06:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh my name is alex kutrubis i'm here on
 
06:37:47.350 --> 06:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of my client
 
06:37:49.430 --> 06:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
the community support network which is
 
06:37:52.468 --> 06:37:52.478 align:start position:0%
the association of the ten area agencies
 
06:37:54.468 --> 06:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
that provide services and supports to
 
06:37:55.830 --> 06:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
06:37:57.670 --> 06:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities and acquired brain
 
06:37:57.680 --> 06:37:58.948 align:start position:0%
disabilities and acquired brain
disorders

06:37:58.948 --> 06:37:58.958 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
we did not take a position on this
 
06:38:03.910 --> 06:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in the senate however we are
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
here with some concerns about it and
 
06:38:08.788 --> 06:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
really the reason is as introduced the
 
06:38:10.390 --> 06:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
bill just added
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
five words including a case management
 
06:38:15.910 --> 06:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
agency to the definition of health care
 
06:38:19.110 --> 06:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
home health care provider under rsa 151
 
06:38:21.190 --> 06:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is as you heard the residential
 
06:38:23.110 --> 06:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
care and health facility licensing
 
06:38:27.190 --> 06:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
statute that's administered by dhhs
 
06:38:29.110 --> 06:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
several weeks after the public hearing
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the senate there was a replace all
 
06:38:31.680 --> 06:38:32.948 align:start position:0%
in the senate there was a replace all
amendment

06:38:32.948 --> 06:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we believe has altered the scope
 
06:38:37.910 --> 06:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
and reach of the legislation
 
06:38:40.548 --> 06:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
in general we believe that this bill as
 
06:38:42.628 --> 06:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate is ambiguous and
 
06:38:44.948 --> 06:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
confusing for example the language on
 
06:38:46.468 --> 06:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
line six
 
06:38:48.468 --> 06:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
adds case management to the definition
 
06:38:50.390 --> 06:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
of home health care provider
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
this action would lump case management
 
06:38:54.868 --> 06:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
with a long list of direct service
 
06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
providers that are on lines 8 through
 
06:38:56.638 --> 06:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
providers that are on lines 8 through
11.

06:38:57.750 --> 06:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
11.
 
06:39:00.230 --> 06:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
yet if you go down to line 22
 
06:39:02.150 --> 06:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
kate it says case management activities
 
06:39:04.070 --> 06:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
shall not include activities which
 
06:39:05.830 --> 06:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
constitute the direct delivery of other
 
06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
services so why are we amending
 
06:39:10.708 --> 06:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
a direct service definition to include
 
06:39:12.628 --> 06:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
case management
 
06:39:14.070 --> 06:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
at the bill's public hearing in the
 
06:39:16.868 --> 06:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
senate hhs offered an amendment
 
06:39:18.548 --> 06:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
to solve at least one of the stated
 
06:39:20.788 --> 06:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
goals of this legislation but again the
 
06:39:22.628 --> 06:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill as amended by the senate is not
 
06:39:24.788 --> 06:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
what was proposed by the department
 
06:39:26.868 --> 06:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
and obviously this is concerning because
 
06:39:29.590 --> 06:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
hhs is going to be the state agency that
 
06:39:32.548 --> 06:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
will administer and enforce this law
 
06:39:34.310 --> 06:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
the suggested language
 
06:39:36.468 --> 06:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
and history of this issue was contained
 
06:39:38.310 --> 06:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
in a letter that was sent to speaker
 
06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
packard dated november 18 2021
 
06:39:44.788 --> 06:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
it's also unclear to us
 
06:39:47.510 --> 06:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of this bill is to merely
 
06:39:49.110 --> 06:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
license the entities that have
 
06:39:51.670 --> 06:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
historically been licensed or is it to
 
06:39:54.548 --> 06:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
expand licensure to new entities and
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
again if you look at the letter that was
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
sent to the speaker of the house
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have that letter
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh well it's not my it's a letter from
 
06:40:05.910 --> 06:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
hhs um so i don't want to speak for them
 
06:40:08.070 --> 06:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
or present their letter but i'm happy to
 
06:40:10.390 --> 06:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
get you a copy of it but in that letter
 
06:40:13.110 --> 06:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
there's concern that mental health
 
06:40:15.430 --> 06:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
housing children services developmental
 
06:40:17.830 --> 06:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities could be pulled into
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
requiring a license for case management
 
06:40:24.708 --> 06:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
if we don't amend this statute correctly
 
06:40:26.468 --> 06:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
we're also confused about the general
 
06:40:28.150 --> 06:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill
 
06:40:30.788 --> 06:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
there were inconsistent reasons provided
 
06:40:33.270 --> 06:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
for why this bill is here uh there were
 
06:40:35.030 --> 06:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistent reasons i think provided
 
06:40:35.040 --> 06:40:35.910 align:start position:0%
inconsistent reasons i think provided
today

06:40:35.910 --> 06:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:40:37.430 --> 06:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh for example you heard it was an
 
06:40:39.030 --> 06:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
administrative fix it's a it's a
 
06:40:40.948 --> 06:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill
 
06:40:43.030 --> 06:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
but the sponsor said today
 
06:40:44.948 --> 06:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
we talked about conflict of interest and
 
06:40:47.110 --> 06:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
how some of the medicaid waivers are out
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
of compliance
 
06:40:50.310 --> 06:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
is it a bill to
 
06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
get us into compliance with conflict of
 
06:40:53.910 --> 06:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
interest or is it just to license the
 
06:40:55.430 --> 06:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
people that have been licensed for 28
 
06:40:57.270 --> 06:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
years i think there's there's a lot of
 
06:40:58.628 --> 06:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
different statements that have been made
 
06:40:58.638 --> 06:40:59.350 align:start position:0%
different statements that have been made
and

06:40:59.350 --> 06:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:00.708 --> 06:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
i i think we need to get some
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
clarification on that before we pass the
 
06:41:02.638 --> 06:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
clarification on that before we pass the
bill

06:41:03.670 --> 06:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:41:05.350 --> 06:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
if it's an attempt
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
to try and enforce the conflict-free
 
06:41:09.990 --> 06:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
case management issue
 
06:41:11.430 --> 06:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
we see some problems with how it's
 
06:41:14.230 --> 06:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
worded in the bill as presented here
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
as you heard conflict-free case
 
06:41:19.110 --> 06:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
management requires that the assessment
 
06:41:21.670 --> 06:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
and coordination of service is separate
 
06:41:23.750 --> 06:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
from the delivery of service and the
 
06:41:25.670 --> 06:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
goal is to limit any conscious or
 
06:41:28.310 --> 06:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias that a case manager or
 
06:41:31.270 --> 06:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
case management agency may have
 
06:41:33.910 --> 06:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
hhs is currently working with all of the
 
06:41:36.390 --> 06:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to get new hampshire into
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
compliance they're working with with cms
 
06:41:39.990 --> 06:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
centers for medicare and medicaid
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
services they're working with the air
 
06:41:43.430 --> 06:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
agencies they're working with the
 
06:41:46.230 --> 06:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
independent case management companies
 
06:41:48.868 --> 06:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
we already have a plan in place
 
06:41:50.390 --> 06:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's a corrective action plan as you
 
06:41:50.400 --> 06:41:51.350 align:start position:0%
it's a corrective action plan as you
heard

06:41:51.350 --> 06:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:41:53.830 --> 06:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the goal is to be in compliance by
 
06:41:56.548 --> 06:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
august of 2023
 
06:41:58.788 --> 06:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that adding
 
06:42:01.830 --> 06:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
again to the confusion of this issue
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
the words case management or case
 
06:42:06.390 --> 06:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
management service provider do not
 
06:42:09.510 --> 06:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
appear in rsa 171 which is the law that
 
06:42:12.390 --> 06:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
governs developmental disabilities
 
06:42:14.150 --> 06:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
case management also does not appear in
 
06:42:16.548 --> 06:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules h.e.m 500 that
 
06:42:19.590 --> 06:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
clarify 171a which again is the dd
 
06:42:19.600 --> 06:42:21.030 align:start position:0%
clarify 171a which again is the dd
statute

06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:42:24.310 --> 06:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
dd uses the term service coordination
 
06:42:26.070 --> 06:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
and again because of these issues i
 
06:42:28.468 --> 06:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
think hhs amendment is the is the way to
 
06:42:31.270 --> 06:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
go we shouldn't be trying to regulate
 
06:42:33.110 --> 06:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
a human service system that's governed
 
06:42:36.230 --> 06:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
under 171a under 151. it doesn't make
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
any sense to do that and you heard about
 
06:42:40.548 --> 06:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest i think this bill
 
06:42:42.070 --> 06:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
as presented by the senate has a lot of
 
06:42:44.628 --> 06:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
conflicts have been or excuse me
 
06:42:47.190 --> 06:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and again it
 
06:42:48.708 --> 06:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
goes back to the issue of conflict of
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
interest there are exceptions
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
under the federal law for conflict of
 
06:42:55.750 --> 06:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
if you can demonstrate that the only
 
06:42:59.750 --> 06:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
willing and qualified case manager for
 
06:43:01.830 --> 06:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
the individual who needs the service is
 
06:43:03.750 --> 06:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
also affiliated with the direct service
 
06:43:07.030 --> 06:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
provider you can have an exception if
 
06:43:09.670 --> 06:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of service providers and
 
06:43:10.948 --> 06:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
obviously we have a health care
 
06:43:12.548 --> 06:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage in the state right
 
06:43:13.990 --> 06:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
now and we don't want to put something
 
06:43:16.948 --> 06:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's overly broad in the statute
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
that could
 
06:43:20.150 --> 06:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
deny people's services
 
06:43:22.390 --> 06:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
but again we are working to get in
 
06:43:24.548 --> 06:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
compliance with the with the conflict of
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
free conflict free case management issue
 
06:43:29.510 --> 06:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
but we have to do it in a thoughtful way
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:43:32.948 --> 06:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
phase individuals in
 
06:43:35.430 --> 06:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
the system as it's configured
 
06:43:37.110 --> 06:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability system as
 
06:43:38.390 --> 06:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's currently configured has been in
 
06:43:41.030 --> 06:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
place for a long long time
 
06:43:42.230 --> 06:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take some time to
 
06:43:44.628 --> 06:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
unwind that which is why we need to take
 
06:43:45.990 --> 06:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
our time and make sure that we do it
 
06:43:48.788 --> 06:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
correctly so again
 
06:43:51.670 --> 06:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
if we need to amend the statute or amend
 
06:43:53.510 --> 06:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the rule to come into compliance with
 
06:43:54.948 --> 06:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
06:43:57.110 --> 06:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
dhhs knows how to do that they're not
 
06:43:58.708 --> 06:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
shy as you know about coming to the
 
06:44:00.788 --> 06:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
legislature and asking for changes they
 
06:44:03.350 --> 06:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
are not asking for this
 
06:44:05.190 --> 06:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to be very cautious
 
06:44:06.868 --> 06:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
about amending it if they're if they're
 
06:44:09.750 --> 06:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
not in agreement and do not feel that it
 
06:44:11.750 --> 06:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
gives them the correct language and the
 
06:44:13.190 --> 06:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
correct authority to do what they need
 
06:44:15.190 --> 06:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
to do whether it's conflict of interest
 
06:44:17.110 --> 06:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
or whether it's to license the existing
 
06:44:19.190 --> 06:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
case management companies if the goal of
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
this and the purpose of this is just to
 
06:44:23.030 --> 06:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
license the independent case managers as
 
06:44:24.948 --> 06:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
has been the case for many years we have
 
06:44:27.190 --> 06:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
no problem with it but we think it goes
 
06:44:29.030 --> 06:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that at this point
 
06:44:30.708 --> 06:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair
 
06:44:32.150 --> 06:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i believe
 
06:44:33.670 --> 06:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
is there a question to representative
 
06:44:36.230 --> 06:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
road thank you madam chairman um
 
06:44:38.468 --> 06:44:38.478 align:start position:0%

06:44:41.670 --> 06:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um use the the terminology we
 
06:44:41.680 --> 06:44:42.548 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um use the the terminology we
are

06:44:42.548 --> 06:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:44:44.548 --> 06:44:44.558 align:start position:0%

06:44:47.510 --> 06:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
towards um addressing you know becoming
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
in compliance can you just be very
 
06:44:51.190 --> 06:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
specific on who is we
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
well it's a broad group of stakeholders
 
06:44:54.070 --> 06:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
a variety of work groups that dhhs has
 
06:44:59.990 --> 06:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
formulated around the conflict uh free
 
06:45:02.708 --> 06:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
case management issue so anyone is
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
welcome to to join those groups but it's
 
06:45:07.430 --> 06:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
really being spearheaded by dhhs
 
06:45:09.830 --> 06:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
but anyone who's a stakeholder is uh is
 
06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
part of those groups at one way one way
 
06:45:14.468 --> 06:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
so there was a question asked by
 
06:45:21.190 --> 06:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative to um
 
06:45:24.150 --> 06:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
to the people that testified prior to
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
you about dhhs and
 
06:45:28.788 --> 06:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken it was
 
06:45:30.390 --> 06:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know being on board with this and if
 
06:45:32.070 --> 06:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken they had said that they
 
06:45:33.910 --> 06:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
believed that they were are you are you
 
06:45:35.910 --> 06:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
saying that dhhs is not
 
06:45:37.590 --> 06:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
they i mean i don't want to speak for
 
06:45:38.948 --> 06:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
the department but they're not on board
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
with this they provided a letter okay
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
they provided a letter in the senate
 
06:45:43.920 --> 06:45:45.190 align:start position:0%
they provided a letter in the senate
that

06:45:45.190 --> 06:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
suggested language to solve this issue
 
06:45:49.750 --> 06:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is not what is before you as
 
06:45:51.670 --> 06:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate it's a completely
 
06:45:51.680 --> 06:45:52.868 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate it's a completely
different

06:45:52.868 --> 06:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:45:56.868 --> 06:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:59.350 --> 06:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you apologize
 
06:46:01.110 --> 06:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:46:03.750 --> 06:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have one representative bailey
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you didn't we hear earlier that
 
06:46:08.150 --> 06:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
dhs doesn't really want anything to do
 
06:46:09.510 --> 06:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:46:11.350 --> 06:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
i i i don't want to speak for the
 
06:46:13.110 --> 06:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
department but i believe that they want
 
06:46:15.270 --> 06:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to continue to license case management
 
06:46:15.280 --> 06:46:17.350 align:start position:0%
to continue to license case management
agencies

06:46:17.350 --> 06:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
06:46:19.110 --> 06:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
we need to let them speak for themselves
 
06:46:21.110 --> 06:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
so please don't ask any questions about
 
06:46:23.590 --> 06:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
what dhs intends
 
06:46:23.600 --> 06:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
what dhs intends
um

06:46:25.670 --> 06:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
but i would ask you if your concern
 
06:46:30.868 --> 06:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
is that this
 
06:46:33.430 --> 06:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislation appears to muddle the case
 
06:46:35.830 --> 06:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
management of the
 
06:46:38.070 --> 06:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
home and community-based care
 
06:46:40.468 --> 06:46:40.478 align:start position:0%
organizations which these people are
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking with the developmentally
 
06:46:42.000 --> 06:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
talking with the developmentally
disabled

06:46:43.510 --> 06:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
06:46:46.628 --> 06:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
case management which is
 
06:46:48.468 --> 06:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
i would assume it would be fairly
 
06:46:50.548 --> 06:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
similar in what you do
 
06:46:52.948 --> 06:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
but it's driven by different statutes is
 
06:46:54.708 --> 06:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
06:46:56.390 --> 06:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes i mean case management the case
 
06:46:58.628 --> 06:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
management functions are very similar
 
06:47:00.150 --> 06:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a different system it's
 
06:47:03.110 --> 06:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
configured differently and historically
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
the dd system case management has been a
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
part of
 
06:47:08.310 --> 06:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
the delivery of the service and again
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to unwind that
 
06:47:10.160 --> 06:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
we're trying to unwind that
slowly

06:47:11.270 --> 06:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
06:47:14.548 --> 06:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh over time in consultation with okay
 
06:47:17.270 --> 06:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
cms and all the stakeholders
 
06:47:18.868 --> 06:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
so yes we need to amend the correct
 
06:47:22.070 --> 06:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
statute and so that in your case the
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
development of disabled case management
 
06:47:28.548 --> 06:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management issue may
 
06:47:32.868 --> 06:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
have arisen because you did have
 
06:47:34.948 --> 06:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
conflicts yeah correct there is no
 
06:47:39.350 --> 06:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
conflict with the cfi case management
 
06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
but there but there is there is still
 
06:47:43.910 --> 06:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
but we're working to change it there is
 
06:47:46.070 --> 06:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
conflict with the dd case management
 
06:47:47.430 --> 06:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
which is why we're under the corrective
 
06:47:49.110 --> 06:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
action plan
 
06:47:50.390 --> 06:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes things a little
 
06:47:52.310 --> 06:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
clearer thank you are there any other
 
06:47:52.320 --> 06:47:54.230 align:start position:0%
clearer thank you are there any other
questions

06:47:54.230 --> 06:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
representative fellows can i just get
 
06:47:58.708 --> 06:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
you to repeat those last two sentences
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
without acronyms so i know what so
 
06:48:03.350 --> 06:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's four we have four waivers
 
06:48:05.430 --> 06:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid waivers in the state of new
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire home and community-based
 
06:48:10.310 --> 06:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
waivers they uh three of them are
 
06:48:12.310 --> 06:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
considered developmental services
 
06:48:12.320 --> 06:48:13.990 align:start position:0%
considered developmental services
waivers

06:48:13.990 --> 06:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
06:48:16.150 --> 06:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
one is the dd waiver developmental
 
06:48:18.390 --> 06:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities waiver which is for adults
 
06:48:20.628 --> 06:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
who have developmental disabilities one
 
06:48:22.310 --> 06:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
is called the in-home support waiver
 
06:48:24.468 --> 06:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
which is for children under the age of
 
06:48:27.670 --> 06:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
21 who have severe disabilities
 
06:48:29.990 --> 06:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we have the acquired brain disorder
 
06:48:33.510 --> 06:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
waiver which is people who have uh
 
06:48:35.910 --> 06:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
over the age of 21 who have have a brain
 
06:48:38.310 --> 06:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
injury we need services and supports
 
06:48:40.150 --> 06:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
those three waivers are under a
 
06:48:42.070 --> 06:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan with the federal
 
06:48:42.080 --> 06:48:44.708 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan with the federal
government

06:48:44.708 --> 06:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:46.708 --> 06:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill is attempting to
 
06:48:48.948 --> 06:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
put pressure on
 
06:48:51.030 --> 06:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to get into compliance
 
06:48:52.070 --> 06:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
but that's not what i wanted to
 
06:48:55.110 --> 06:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
speculate on what what what that's what
 
06:48:57.110 --> 06:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are there he said that this
 
06:48:59.030 --> 06:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
could be used as a tool to enforce that
 
06:48:59.040 --> 06:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
could be used as a tool to enforce that
law

06:49:01.510 --> 06:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:04.468 --> 06:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
06:49:06.788 --> 06:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
president schmidt
 
06:49:09.430 --> 06:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
i i think you're the chair's
 
06:49:11.830 --> 06:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
earlier remark about hearing from the
 
06:49:14.628 --> 06:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
department is
 
06:49:16.868 --> 06:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time so we don't
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
speculate about what the department says
 
06:49:25.670 --> 06:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:27.670 --> 06:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:49:37.350 --> 06:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:39.830 --> 06:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh you said you said you had written
 
06:49:39.840 --> 06:49:41.350 align:start position:0%
uh you said you said you had written
testimony

testimony
 
06:49:43.590 --> 06:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh so yes good afternoon for the record
 
06:49:44.788 --> 06:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
my name is melissa sainz here i'm the
 
06:49:46.230 --> 06:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
chief lead officer for the department of

i don't have any written testimony i
 
06:49:58.310 --> 06:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
have a proposed amendment which amends
 
06:50:00.548 --> 06:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
the current language that was passed out
 
06:50:02.468 --> 06:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
of the senate i'm happy to distribute
 
06:50:07.430 --> 06:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
first explain to us why we need why
 
06:50:11.750 --> 06:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
what your intentions are because that
 
06:50:13.750 --> 06:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
appears to be the subject of immigration
 
06:50:15.990 --> 06:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
sure speculation absolutely happy to do
 
06:50:16.000 --> 06:50:16.788 align:start position:0%
sure speculation absolutely happy to do
so

06:50:16.788 --> 06:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:18.230 --> 06:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:50:18.240 --> 06:50:18.948 align:start position:0%
so um
so

06:50:18.948 --> 06:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:20.948 --> 06:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh heidi kroll was correct we did
 
06:50:23.350 --> 06:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
convene a stakeholder group we were
 
06:50:25.510 --> 06:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
asked to do so by the legislature to
 
06:50:25.520 --> 06:50:26.628 align:start position:0%
asked to do so by the legislature to
review

06:50:26.628 --> 06:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
case management and the licensure of
 
06:50:30.230 --> 06:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
case management and come up with a plan
 
06:50:32.070 --> 06:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
while we were doing under
 
06:50:33.910 --> 06:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
who in the legislature asked you and
 
06:50:36.708 --> 06:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
what it was senate bill
 
06:50:40.628 --> 06:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
162. senate bill 162. thank you
 
06:50:43.270 --> 06:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um and so
 
06:50:46.548 --> 06:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
uh we began reviewing that at the same
 
06:50:50.070 --> 06:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
time we were amending our rules for uh
 
06:50:53.750 --> 06:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
hep 819 which overs which is the uh
 
06:50:56.150 --> 06:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
oversight authority for um for case
 
06:50:59.670 --> 06:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
management agencies under rsa 151 and so
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
while we were doing that um
 
06:51:04.390 --> 06:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
the the statutory authority that is
 
06:51:06.310 --> 06:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
listed currently on on the rules right
 
06:51:09.030 --> 06:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
now is rsa 151.5
 
06:51:11.670 --> 06:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
and that is the only place in rsa151
 
06:51:13.510 --> 06:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
where the term case management agency
 
06:51:16.628 --> 06:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
exists and that is the fees section so
 
06:51:18.708 --> 06:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
it essentially says that people need to
 
06:51:20.468 --> 06:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
be charged a certain fee if they want to
 
06:51:22.788 --> 06:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
be a case management agency
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
but that's typically not what we would
 
06:51:27.030 --> 06:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
see in a statutory authority to create
 
06:51:27.040 --> 06:51:28.230 align:start position:0%
see in a statutory authority to create
rules

06:51:28.230 --> 06:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
rules
 
06:51:30.628 --> 06:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
for for that licensure
 
06:51:31.910 --> 06:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
so in
 
06:51:33.350 --> 06:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
an effort to
 
06:51:35.910 --> 06:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
clarify and ensure that case management
 
06:51:37.830 --> 06:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
agencies can continue to be licensed and
 
06:51:39.670 --> 06:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
that there is that appropriate statutory
 
06:51:42.468 --> 06:51:42.478 align:start position:0%
authority when we go in front of jailcar
 
06:51:45.510 --> 06:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
we have suggested that we license
 
06:51:47.030 --> 06:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
continued obviously to license case
 
06:51:48.708 --> 06:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
management agencies but what we did was
 
06:51:51.190 --> 06:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
we pulled out the existing language that
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
was in the rules
 
06:51:55.270 --> 06:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
that has been approved by jail car for
 
06:51:56.390 --> 06:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
for a
 
06:51:59.270 --> 06:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
period of time now as well as those who
 
06:52:01.190 --> 06:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
are exempt
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
from licensure as a case management
 
06:52:05.510 --> 06:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
agency one of those being the area
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
agencies and those currently exist in
 
06:52:10.708 --> 06:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
the rules right now so we verbatim took
 
06:52:14.310 --> 06:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
them from the rules and placed them in a
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
a paragraph and presented that to
 
06:52:18.788 --> 06:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
senator bradley and then senator bradley
 
06:52:20.708 --> 06:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
was working and knew that senator evard
 
06:52:23.110 --> 06:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
was working with this group here and so
 
06:52:25.750 --> 06:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
he had asked that that we utilized this
 
06:52:25.760 --> 06:52:26.708 align:start position:0%
he had asked that that we utilized this
vehicle

06:52:26.708 --> 06:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
06:52:28.548 --> 06:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
and instead of
 
06:52:31.510 --> 06:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
a one that senator brownlee had to move
 
06:52:33.670 --> 06:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
this language forward so
 
06:52:33.680 --> 06:52:35.270 align:start position:0%
this language forward so
essentially

06:52:35.270 --> 06:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
when it went in front of the senate the
 
06:52:38.708 --> 06:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
language changed to something that was
 
06:52:42.310 --> 06:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
proposed by by um by heidi kroll and and
 
06:52:44.390 --> 06:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
the group um that is our their case
 
06:52:46.948 --> 06:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
management agencies and so we then took
 
06:52:48.230 --> 06:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
that language in an effort to
 
06:52:50.230 --> 06:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
collaborate and and amended some of it
 
06:52:51.830 --> 06:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that it would be
 
06:52:54.070 --> 06:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
relevant to licensure
 
06:52:56.468 --> 06:52:56.478 align:start position:0%
so that we are proposing are say that it
 
06:53:00.628 --> 06:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
be rsa 151 2 instead of rsa 151 2b
 
06:53:02.948 --> 06:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that it it is
 
06:53:04.868 --> 06:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
not considered from a light a state
 
06:53:06.628 --> 06:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
licensure perspective they are not
 
06:53:08.708 --> 06:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
considered home healthy home health
 
06:53:08.718 --> 06:53:10.310 align:start position:0%
considered home healthy home health
agencies

06:53:10.310 --> 06:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
06:53:11.910 --> 06:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
they have always been separate if
 
06:53:13.830 --> 06:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
somebody if a case management agency
 
06:53:15.430 --> 06:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
also has
 
06:53:17.190 --> 06:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
a home health component to it they're
 
06:53:19.430 --> 06:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
required to be duly licensed so they
 
06:53:21.830 --> 06:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to hold two separate licenses so
 
06:53:23.590 --> 06:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
case management agencies from a
 
06:53:26.788 --> 06:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
licensing perspective are not considered
 
06:53:28.708 --> 06:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
home health agencies and so we suggest
 
06:53:30.868 --> 06:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
instead of putting in section 2b to put
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
it in the general section which
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
outlines all of the other entities that
 
06:53:37.830 --> 06:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
need to be um that needs to be licensed
 
06:53:40.150 --> 06:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals nursing homes adult day care
 
06:53:41.990 --> 06:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
centers and all those others so it would
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
just be its own section so we took their
 
06:53:45.750 --> 06:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
language and
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
amended that put it instead of keeping
 
06:53:49.990 --> 06:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
it in 2b uh we're requesting to put it
 
06:53:51.590 --> 06:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
in section two
 
06:53:53.590 --> 06:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then we also removed a lot of the
 
06:53:56.230 --> 06:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
language that was not typically things
 
06:53:57.590 --> 06:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
that you would see in a licensing
 
06:53:59.750 --> 06:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
statute such as the conflict-free case
 
06:54:01.590 --> 06:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
management that's something that's a
 
06:54:03.750 --> 06:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
federal requirement this is state
 
06:54:06.230 --> 06:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
licensing law this is really about the
 
06:54:08.788 --> 06:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
licensure of case management's here case
 
06:54:10.070 --> 06:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
management agencies here in new
 
06:54:10.080 --> 06:54:11.350 align:start position:0%
management agencies here in new
hampshire

06:54:11.350 --> 06:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
and although there may be some
 
06:54:14.788 --> 06:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
requirements under the waiver and all
 
06:54:16.310 --> 06:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
that those are very separate and
 
06:54:18.150 --> 06:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
distinct and not actually
 
06:54:20.230 --> 06:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
part of all any of our statutes when it
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
06:54:23.670 --> 06:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to licensing for example
 
06:54:25.270 --> 06:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals hospitals are currently
 
06:54:28.150 --> 06:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
licensed there's many many many federal
 
06:54:29.910 --> 06:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
requirements that hospitals are required
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
to comply with
 
06:54:33.110 --> 06:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
but we don't put all of those
 
06:54:35.190 --> 06:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
requirements in the licensing statute
 
06:54:37.110 --> 06:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
the licensing statute is just there
 
06:54:39.350 --> 06:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to say the state needs to
 
06:54:41.510 --> 06:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
license these entities and it's for the
 
06:54:43.510 --> 06:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the patients that
 
06:54:45.030 --> 06:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
are being seen or the clients that are
 
06:54:47.750 --> 06:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
being seen by those entities and so that
 
06:54:49.750 --> 06:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
is our suggestion so we are we are
 
06:54:51.510 --> 06:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the with the definition
 
06:54:53.670 --> 06:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
language that they have we just remove
 
06:54:55.990 --> 06:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
some of the areas in which it may be
 
06:54:58.230 --> 06:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
something that's in a federal law in a
 
06:55:01.750 --> 06:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
waiver or somewhere um and that is
 
06:55:03.350 --> 06:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
essentially typically something you
 
06:55:06.070 --> 06:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
would see in rules and so that's that's
 
06:55:08.310 --> 06:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
what this this amendment is for i know
 
06:55:10.150 --> 06:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that came that
 
06:55:11.510 --> 06:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
have come up a lot of questions i'm
 
06:55:13.190 --> 06:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
happy to go through and answer some of
 
06:55:14.708 --> 06:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
those questions
 
06:55:16.468 --> 06:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anyone wants to if you
 
06:55:18.310 --> 06:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
want me to pause now and see or if you

those questions
 
06:55:25.670 --> 06:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:27.910 --> 06:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us
 
06:55:29.590 --> 06:55:29.600 align:start position:0%

06:55:32.708 --> 06:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
presented us to the senate so so there
 
06:55:34.948 --> 06:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
was a present presentation i did not
 
06:55:36.548 --> 06:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
present it there were other members who
 
06:55:37.990 --> 06:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
presented it and i don't know if they
 
06:55:40.708 --> 06:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
got into this uh great of detail the
 
06:55:42.548 --> 06:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the language that we had
 
06:55:44.948 --> 06:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
proposed and the amended language that
 
06:55:47.750 --> 06:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
came the day of the senate hearing the
 
06:55:49.750 --> 06:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing i wasn't physically
 
06:55:51.590 --> 06:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
present but they were different and so
 
06:55:53.750 --> 06:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
that was i don't i'm not a hundred
 
06:55:55.270 --> 06:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
percent sure what the testimony was but
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:00.868 --> 06:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't that nice they're letting us weed
 
06:56:02.468 --> 06:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
out the details
 
06:56:02.478 --> 06:56:04.230 align:start position:0%
out the details
representative

06:56:04.230 --> 06:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:56:04.240 --> 06:56:05.350 align:start position:0%
representative
um

06:56:05.350 --> 06:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:07.990 --> 06:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
who's doing the licensing here
 
06:56:09.750 --> 06:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bureau of licensing
 
06:56:12.788 --> 06:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me does the hhs have its own
 
06:56:15.350 --> 06:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
area of licensing yes sir then why is
 
06:56:17.110 --> 06:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill here
 
06:56:18.948 --> 06:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
this is a headache because it's in
 
06:56:18.958 --> 06:56:20.310 align:start position:0%
this is a headache because it's in
statute

06:56:20.310 --> 06:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:56:22.230 --> 06:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the requirements for licenses
 
06:56:24.468 --> 06:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
are in statute they can't just make up
 
06:56:29.190 --> 06:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:30.788 --> 06:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
and why is it here it's because we're
 
06:56:33.830 --> 06:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
stuck with it
 
06:56:33.840 --> 06:56:34.628 align:start position:0%
stuck with it
the

06:56:34.628 --> 06:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:56:36.868 --> 06:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
i will say that it is extremely
 
06:56:36.878 --> 06:56:38.230 align:start position:0%
i will say that it is extremely
unfortunate

06:56:38.230 --> 06:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
06:56:40.948 --> 06:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
that this is showing up today because
 
06:56:43.990 --> 06:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
our deadline is next week
 
06:56:46.310 --> 06:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate having a copies of
 
06:56:48.788 --> 06:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
your amendment and then i think we will
 
06:56:51.110 --> 06:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
let people ask questions absolutely you
 
06:56:52.948 --> 06:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
want me to hand that now
 
06:56:52.958 --> 06:56:54.310 align:start position:0%
want me to hand that now
yeah

06:56:54.310 --> 06:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:56:57.830 --> 06:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
and who are there questions please
 
06:57:03.350 --> 06:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:06.150 --> 06:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay well i i do kind of have a question
 
06:57:08.468 --> 06:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
of course
 
06:57:08.478 --> 06:57:12.150 align:start position:0%
of course
so

06:57:12.150 --> 06:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:15.350 --> 06:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
you are of course working to revise your
 
06:57:18.548 --> 06:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
819 rule which is expiring in january
 
06:57:20.310 --> 06:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
06:57:22.230 --> 06:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
and you have no problem with continuing
 
06:57:26.830 --> 06:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
the licensure you correct just a
 
06:57:30.628 --> 06:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
a can't a disagreement
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the policeman where it should be
 
06:57:34.948 --> 06:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
placed okay fine that's
 
06:57:36.708 --> 06:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:43.350 --> 06:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
um conflict-free case management is not
 
06:57:44.548 --> 06:57:44.558 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:57:46.788 --> 06:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
home and community-based care it's in
 
06:57:48.628 --> 06:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
the other areas of
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid case management dd and correct
 
06:57:54.628 --> 06:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
okay well that's
 
06:57:58.150 --> 06:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:00.788 --> 06:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone else have any questions
 
06:58:02.390 --> 06:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
or clarifying well we have all these
 
06:58:04.548 --> 06:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
experts here
 
06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
brooks and laccas
 
06:58:09.030 --> 06:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
so first um i understand you have this
 
06:58:11.030 --> 06:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment you've got some concerns about
 
06:58:11.040 --> 06:58:12.070 align:start position:0%
amendment you've got some concerns about
the

06:58:12.070 --> 06:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:58:13.990 --> 06:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
current senate bill but i guess my
 
06:58:15.990 --> 06:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
question is if the senate bill were
 
06:58:18.868 --> 06:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
passed as it stands right now
 
06:58:20.548 --> 06:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
06:58:21.990 --> 06:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know do you think you'd have the
 
06:58:24.708 --> 06:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
authority to license
 
06:58:27.030 --> 06:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
these case management organizations
 
06:58:28.468 --> 06:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
number one
 
06:58:31.110 --> 06:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
06:58:33.270 --> 06:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
what problems do you think would be
 
06:58:36.310 --> 06:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
caused with the current language
 
06:58:39.910 --> 06:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
so um as for the placement of it that
 
06:58:42.390 --> 06:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
the case management agencies are are
 
06:58:44.868 --> 06:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
included in the home health um statute
 
06:58:46.628 --> 06:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
06:58:48.390 --> 06:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
requirements under home health that
 
06:58:50.150 --> 06:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't exist for case management case
 
06:58:52.230 --> 06:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
management as
 
06:58:57.110 --> 06:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
as spoken by alex earlier there is a
 
06:58:59.350 --> 06:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
their home healthcare is a direct care
 
06:59:01.670 --> 06:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
service and in case management is
 
06:59:04.230 --> 06:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
indirect and if we
 
06:59:05.910 --> 06:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
they currently have to be licensed duly
 
06:59:08.230 --> 06:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
licensed if they perform both services
 
06:59:10.310 --> 06:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
and the oversight of a home health
 
06:59:12.070 --> 06:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
agency is very different
 
06:59:13.430 --> 06:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
in that
 
06:59:16.390 --> 06:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
we we actually oversee the services that
 
06:59:18.868 --> 06:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
are being provided we conduct surveys
 
06:59:20.468 --> 06:59:20.478 align:start position:0%
very differently at a home health
 
06:59:20.478 --> 06:59:21.830 align:start position:0%
very differently at a home health
provider

06:59:21.830 --> 06:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
provider
 
06:59:23.830 --> 06:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
and we review medical records and other
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
things differently than if it were a
 
06:59:27.990 --> 06:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
case management agency
 
06:59:31.910 --> 06:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
and um also the um
 
06:59:34.150 --> 06:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
the home health i've spoken with gina
 
06:59:35.830 --> 06:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
balkas here and she's she's here from
 
06:59:37.830 --> 06:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
the home health association they haven't
 
06:59:39.430 --> 06:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
been considered
 
06:59:41.510 --> 06:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
a case management agencies have not been
 
06:59:43.350 --> 06:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
considered a home health from their
 
06:59:44.628 --> 06:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
perspective but
 
06:59:47.350 --> 06:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
the certification as well for
 
06:59:48.548 --> 06:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
medicare because it's the bureau of
 
06:59:50.948 --> 06:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification
 
06:59:53.430 --> 06:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
many of our home health agencies are
 
06:59:53.440 --> 06:59:55.430 align:start position:0%
many of our home health agencies are
certified

06:59:55.430 --> 06:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
certified
 
06:59:58.628 --> 06:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
as well as licensed and there's a
 
07:00:00.788 --> 07:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
what it's called is a deemed licensure
 
07:00:02.708 --> 07:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
so if they're compliant with cms
 
07:00:02.718 --> 07:00:04.070 align:start position:0%
so if they're compliant with cms
regulations

07:00:04.070 --> 07:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
07:00:06.548 --> 07:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
under certification they can receive a
 
07:00:07.990 --> 07:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
state license
 
07:00:10.868 --> 07:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
and so we typically have
 
07:00:12.948 --> 07:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
very different sections for each of
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
those entities to be surveyed in in very
 
07:00:17.750 --> 07:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
different ways because of the fact that
 
07:00:19.430 --> 07:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
some of them are certified some of them
 
07:00:20.788 --> 07:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
are not some of them only provide
 
07:00:22.948 --> 07:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
personal care some of them provide a
 
07:00:25.270 --> 07:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
whole host of hospice services so it's
 
07:00:27.990 --> 07:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
it just it would make the department
 
07:00:29.910 --> 07:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
change a lot of its practices and it may
 
07:00:31.510 --> 07:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
have unintended consequences that we're
 
07:00:33.750 --> 07:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
just not aware of yet
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:41.830 --> 07:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:43.590 --> 07:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative bailey thank you just
 
07:00:45.990 --> 07:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
just a clarification earlier we heard
 
07:00:46.000 --> 07:00:47.590 align:start position:0%
just a clarification earlier we heard
about

07:00:47.590 --> 07:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:00:50.270 --> 07:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
up at least some subset of this is
 
07:00:52.548 --> 07:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
conflict-free whichever only means they
 
07:00:54.390 --> 07:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't actually provide any services at
 
07:00:56.150 --> 07:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
all they arrange for other people to
 
07:00:58.708 --> 07:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
provide services
 
07:00:58.718 --> 07:00:59.910 align:start position:0%
provide services
um

07:00:59.910 --> 07:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct so the conflict-free
 
07:01:03.350 --> 07:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
case management is something that's in
 
07:01:05.670 --> 07:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
federal law that's required and is being
 
07:01:07.670 --> 07:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
overseen by our long-term supports and
 
07:01:09.670 --> 07:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
services that's not actually a licensing
 
07:01:09.680 --> 07:01:10.708 align:start position:0%
services that's not actually a licensing
function

07:01:10.708 --> 07:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
function
 
07:01:12.150 --> 07:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the requirements one
 
07:01:13.670 --> 07:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the requests that we have is that
 
07:01:15.510 --> 07:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
that be removed because it's not a state
 
07:01:18.150 --> 07:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
law licensing issue it is a it's a more
 
07:01:19.670 --> 07:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
of a federal government and compliance
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
issue with the with our cert current
 
07:01:23.430 --> 07:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
waivers and other services that are
 
07:01:25.590 --> 07:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
provided there and follow-up
 
07:01:27.190 --> 07:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
at one point you mentioned there was a
 
07:01:29.030 --> 07:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
conflict where they had to have dual
 
07:01:31.670 --> 07:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
licenses that's if they at that point
 
07:01:35.190 --> 07:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
they would not be conflict-free right
 
07:01:36.948 --> 07:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
they're providing themselves they're
 
07:01:36.958 --> 07:01:38.070 align:start position:0%
they're providing themselves they're
managing

07:01:38.070 --> 07:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
managing
 
07:01:40.708 --> 07:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
so i i actually i have individuals here
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
who may be able to answer that question
 
07:01:44.150 --> 07:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
but from a licensing perspective that's
 
07:01:46.070 --> 07:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
not something that we we look at at all
 
07:01:48.868 --> 07:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
because that conflict-free case
 
07:01:51.270 --> 07:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
management issue is a federal and a
 
07:01:53.190 --> 07:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
funding and a waiver issue
 
07:01:55.030 --> 07:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
licensing really just looks at are you
 
07:01:57.030 --> 07:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
doing the services are you doing it in a
 
07:01:59.030 --> 07:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
safe way and to promote the health of
 
07:02:00.788 --> 07:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
the individual if you're doing case
 
07:02:02.310 --> 07:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
management you get one license if you're
 
07:02:04.150 --> 07:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
doing home health you get one license or
 
07:02:05.510 --> 07:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
if you're doing both then you need to
 
07:02:07.510 --> 07:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
get two licenses you need to have a
 
07:02:09.990 --> 07:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
license for each so that's where our
 
07:02:12.948 --> 07:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
authority ends and and some of the other
 
07:02:14.310 --> 07:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know medicaid compliance and all
 
07:02:16.070 --> 07:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
that picks up and and so that's not
 
07:02:18.548 --> 07:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
really a licensing function at all well
 
07:02:20.310 --> 07:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
so one one more
 
07:02:21.990 --> 07:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
can't you just give them their own
 
07:02:22.000 --> 07:02:23.350 align:start position:0%
can't you just give them their own
paragraph

07:02:23.350 --> 07:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
07:02:25.190 --> 07:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that's what we're suggesting is
 
07:02:26.548 --> 07:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
that they get their own paragraph that
 
07:02:31.990 --> 07:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:35.350 --> 07:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
other comments representative fellows um
 
07:02:37.750 --> 07:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
what are community settings is that
 
07:02:40.070 --> 07:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes is it anything else
 
07:02:41.990 --> 07:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
community settings are are not in
 
07:02:43.910 --> 07:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes they're in out in the
 
07:02:46.468 --> 07:02:46.478 align:start position:0%
community um at people's homes and other
 
07:02:48.868 --> 07:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
settings that would not uh that would
 
07:02:52.230 --> 07:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:54.230 --> 07:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
in a in a like a nursing home or an
 
07:02:56.468 --> 07:02:56.478 align:start position:0%
assisted living so they're not in a
 
07:02:56.478 --> 07:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
assisted living so they're not in a
actual

07:02:58.070 --> 07:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
actual
 
07:03:00.788 --> 07:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
yes that's a healthcare facility
 
07:03:03.110 --> 07:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
to provide these services outside of the
 
07:03:08.390 --> 07:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:10.150 --> 07:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
the saints here would be fair to say
 
07:03:12.708 --> 07:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
that your statute is a mess
 
07:03:15.110 --> 07:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and we actually have done so
 
07:03:17.430 --> 07:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
many so much work on it to try to amend
 
07:03:20.468 --> 07:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
rsa 151 because it's so large
 
07:03:21.910 --> 07:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
i mean we have we have drafts and
 
07:03:23.430 --> 07:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever really wanted to take it
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
up and we actually proposed it right
 
07:03:26.628 --> 07:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
before kovid and somebody said oh no not
 
07:03:29.510 --> 07:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
yet so um so i'm happy to engage with

the additional
language

07:09:54.948 --> 07:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
language
 
07:09:57.910 --> 07:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
that the department has a problem with
 
07:09:59.270 --> 07:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
on the bottom
 
07:10:01.810 --> 07:10:01.820 align:start position:0%
was added
 
07:10:01.820 --> 07:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
was added
[Music]

07:10:03.030 --> 07:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:10:04.468 --> 07:10:04.478 align:start position:0%
by the senate
 
07:10:06.070 --> 07:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
it is
 
07:10:09.670 --> 07:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
a language that appears in federal law
 
07:10:13.590 --> 07:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
the senate chose not to include the
 
07:10:16.310 --> 07:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
citation i'm not exactly
 
07:10:18.708 --> 07:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
certain why um
 
07:10:22.788 --> 07:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
but but that language must be followed
 
07:10:24.390 --> 07:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
07:10:24.400 --> 07:10:25.270 align:start position:0%
whether or not
um

07:10:25.270 --> 07:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:29.110 --> 07:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's in this bill
 
07:10:30.948 --> 07:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
madam chair for the record my name is
 
07:10:32.468 --> 07:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
robert clegg
 
07:10:34.948 --> 07:10:34.958 align:start position:0%
the the language and paragraph two was
 
07:10:37.190 --> 07:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
put in by the senate and they left out
 
07:10:39.750 --> 07:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the site because we know that most of
 
07:10:41.590 --> 07:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
the time the legislature doesn't like to
 
07:10:41.600 --> 07:10:42.390 align:start position:0%
the time the legislature doesn't like to
say

07:10:42.390 --> 07:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
07:10:44.548 --> 07:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
the federal law because then to try to
 
07:10:46.310 --> 07:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
change it requires a whole new set of
 
07:10:46.320 --> 07:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
change it requires a whole new set of
rules

07:10:47.430 --> 07:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
rules
 
07:10:49.750 --> 07:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
so they added just the just the the
 
07:10:49.760 --> 07:10:50.948 align:start position:0%
so they added just the just the the
language

07:10:50.948 --> 07:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
language
 
07:10:52.230 --> 07:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
and as as
 
07:10:55.270 --> 07:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
carolyn said it does say in that
 
07:10:58.070 --> 07:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
has to be conflict-free
 
07:10:59.990 --> 07:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the problem is is right now they're
 
07:11:02.390 --> 07:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
under a plan of of correction because
 
07:11:05.830 --> 07:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are agencies that are providing
 
07:11:07.990 --> 07:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
both the case management
 
07:11:10.390 --> 07:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
and the in the service
 
07:11:12.708 --> 07:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
and so you send one person
 
07:11:14.788 --> 07:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
to that location and you get the charge
 
07:11:16.628 --> 07:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
for two people even though it's the same
 
07:11:18.548 --> 07:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
person doing the same thing
 
07:11:18.558 --> 07:11:19.270 align:start position:0%
person doing the same thing
so

07:11:19.270 --> 07:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:11:21.910 --> 07:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's illegal and i understand that if
 
07:11:24.628 --> 07:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
they can get rid of case managers
 
07:11:27.110 --> 07:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
then cms does say if there are no case
 
07:11:28.948 --> 07:11:28.958 align:start position:0%
managers in your state
 
07:11:31.110 --> 07:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
and you can't get a case manager then
 
07:11:32.868 --> 07:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
the provider can be also the case
 
07:11:35.030 --> 07:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
manager understand that a case manager
 
07:11:37.590 --> 07:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
is the one that sits there and says
 
07:11:39.350 --> 07:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
here's what we believe these people need
 
07:11:41.110 --> 07:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
for services
 
07:11:42.708 --> 07:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
those services are granted it's up to
 
07:11:44.788 --> 07:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
the case manager at that point
 
07:11:47.190 --> 07:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
to determine as on their visits whether
 
07:11:49.750 --> 07:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
or not they're getting the services that
 
07:11:51.830 --> 07:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state is being billed for
 
07:11:54.390 --> 07:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
and over the years as i've been involved
 
07:11:56.070 --> 07:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that many times they
 
07:11:57.430 --> 07:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
aren't getting the services they're
 
07:11:59.750 --> 07:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
being built for all right mike
 
07:12:01.110 --> 07:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
07:12:04.868 --> 07:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm more addressing not not
 
07:12:06.548 --> 07:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill
 
07:12:08.150 --> 07:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
but section one of the bill and the
 
07:12:09.750 --> 07:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
question of whether there's that
 
07:12:14.150 --> 07:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
language which puts it in 151 colon 2-b
 
07:12:16.310 --> 07:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
or the proposed amendment which just
 
07:12:17.670 --> 07:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
puts it in
 
07:12:22.468 --> 07:12:22.478 align:start position:0%
151 colon 2 um section roman i 1.
 
07:12:25.750 --> 07:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
um that if i could get an answer just to
 
07:12:27.750 --> 07:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
that part just to that part the senate
 
07:12:29.910 --> 07:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
was offered the same the same amendment
 
07:12:31.670 --> 07:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
the senate rejected it it was a
 
07:12:33.910 --> 07:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
different lawyer in in the senate
 
07:12:34.948 --> 07:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
um that
 
07:12:37.030 --> 07:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
it wasn't melissa but the senate
 
07:12:39.270 --> 07:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
outright rejected it every senator said
 
07:12:39.280 --> 07:12:40.230 align:start position:0%
outright rejected it every senator said
no

07:12:40.230 --> 07:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:12:42.310 --> 07:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
and and i don't believe that if he
 
07:12:43.750 --> 07:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
changed it back that the senate would
 
07:12:45.670 --> 07:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
accept it in fact the senate has said
 
07:12:47.830 --> 07:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
they won't this is the way they want it
 
07:12:50.390 --> 07:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
to be done the arguments over there took
 
07:12:52.548 --> 07:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
weeks they weren't just one hearing it
 
07:12:55.670 --> 07:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
was weeks uh quick follow-up
 
07:12:57.910 --> 07:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully quick um i mean do you at
 
07:12:59.670 --> 07:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
least have uh
 
07:13:02.150 --> 07:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
can you give summarize very briefly what
 
07:13:04.868 --> 07:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
their concern was with the proposed
 
07:13:06.868 --> 07:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
language by the department
 
07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
every time the department came in they
 
07:13:10.390 --> 07:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
felt that the department wasn't doing
 
07:13:11.910 --> 07:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
what it should do
 
07:13:14.070 --> 07:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
one as a part of a correction
 
07:13:15.430 --> 07:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
if you're doing something that's not
 
07:13:17.350 --> 07:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
legal and jeopardizes our ability to
 
07:13:19.590 --> 07:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
collect money from cms
 
07:13:21.750 --> 07:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
they want they want the correction to
 
07:13:23.910 --> 07:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
start here and be correct
 
07:13:26.070 --> 07:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
case managers need to be where they've
 
07:13:27.990 --> 07:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
been and and to be to be licensed the
 
07:13:29.190 --> 07:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
same way
 
07:13:31.030 --> 07:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that if you
 
07:13:32.948 --> 07:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
did the amendment that they're asking
 
07:13:35.350 --> 07:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
for case managers would no longer be
 
07:13:37.350 --> 07:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
able to provide services to private
 
07:13:37.360 --> 07:13:39.190 align:start position:0%
able to provide services to private
clients

07:13:39.190 --> 07:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
clients
 
07:13:40.310 --> 07:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:13:42.150 --> 07:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's a number of issues with that
 
07:13:43.990 --> 07:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that's been hashed out in the
 
07:13:46.628 --> 07:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
senate as i said weeks
 
07:13:48.788 --> 07:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and they gave us uh
 
07:13:51.750 --> 07:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:53.030 --> 07:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
07:13:54.230 --> 07:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:13:56.310 --> 07:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
07:13:59.510 --> 07:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:01.030 --> 07:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not entirely sure i even
 
07:14:02.468 --> 07:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly but i'm
 
07:14:04.230 --> 07:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
07:14:05.910 --> 07:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment that the little amendment
 
07:14:07.110 --> 07:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
07:14:07.120 --> 07:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
that we had
is

07:14:07.990 --> 07:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:14:10.788 --> 07:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
essentially the same words
 
07:14:10.798 --> 07:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
essentially the same words
that's

07:14:11.750 --> 07:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:14:14.628 --> 07:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
in in the senate bill if when we get
 
07:14:16.628 --> 07:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
down to case management we just use the
 
07:14:18.948 --> 07:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
first sentence in the last sentence and
 
07:14:20.468 --> 07:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
not the stuff in the middle about
 
07:14:20.478 --> 07:14:22.628 align:start position:0%
not the stuff in the middle about
individuals

07:14:22.628 --> 07:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
07:14:24.628 --> 07:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's exactly
 
07:14:26.548 --> 07:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
suitable for a public hearing at this
 
07:14:27.830 --> 07:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
point it's
 
07:14:27.840 --> 07:14:28.948 align:start position:0%
point it's
what

07:14:28.948 --> 07:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
what
 
07:14:28.958 --> 07:14:30.468 align:start position:0%
what
you're

07:14:30.468 --> 07:14:30.478 align:start position:0%
you're
 
07:14:32.070 --> 07:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
you're wordsmithing and that's more
 
07:14:34.948 --> 07:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
suitable for an executive solution
 
07:14:38.708 --> 07:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand if
 
07:14:41.990 --> 07:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
that set of words works for them and
 
07:14:44.708 --> 07:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
it's just them
 
07:14:47.750 --> 07:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's they've already said that
 
07:14:49.430 --> 07:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
07:14:51.990 --> 07:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
they fought over this for weeks and
 
07:14:55.030 --> 07:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
refused it so so i would say that that
 
07:14:56.548 --> 07:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
means those words are not acceptable
 
07:15:00.230 --> 07:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay and then in that case following
 
07:15:02.230 --> 07:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes plea thank you
 
07:15:03.910 --> 07:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's late i'm sorry
 
07:15:03.920 --> 07:15:04.708 align:start position:0%
it's late i'm sorry
um

07:15:04.708 --> 07:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:15:07.670 --> 07:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
if we were not to pass this bill
 
07:15:09.670 --> 07:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
the house were not to pass this bill
 
07:15:12.310 --> 07:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
what would happen and would the issues
 
07:15:13.670 --> 07:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
related to
 
07:15:15.190 --> 07:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
the federal money
 
07:15:18.468 --> 07:15:18.478 align:start position:0%
be addressed somehow
 
07:15:20.310 --> 07:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
if the if the house were not to pass
 
07:15:22.310 --> 07:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
this bill we believe things would be
 
07:15:24.310 --> 07:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
remain the same as they are
 
07:15:26.310 --> 07:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
we would still be licensed under the
 
07:15:28.230 --> 07:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
under the home care and and we would
 
07:15:31.190 --> 07:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
still be case managers and the state of
 
07:15:32.948 --> 07:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would still have to comply
 
07:15:35.430 --> 07:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
with the federal law that says
 
07:15:39.030 --> 07:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
um it has to be conflict-free
 
07:15:39.040 --> 07:15:40.548 align:start position:0%
um it has to be conflict-free
yes

07:15:40.548 --> 07:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:15:42.788 --> 07:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
and we have had testimony that the
 
07:15:45.590 --> 07:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
conflicts are primarily in the
 
07:15:48.708 --> 07:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
the case managers licensed under
 
07:15:51.190 --> 07:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
rsa 171 which is
 
07:15:53.110 --> 07:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if that is true or if
 
07:15:58.468 --> 07:15:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:00.708 --> 07:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
or if that's even relevant
 
07:16:04.948 --> 07:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
i i believe that they're unlicensed in
 
07:16:06.468 --> 07:16:06.478 align:start position:0%
the other
 
07:16:09.670 --> 07:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
systems is my understanding thank you
 
07:16:09.680 --> 07:16:10.468 align:start position:0%
systems is my understanding thank you
yeah

07:16:10.468 --> 07:16:10.478 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:16:12.310 --> 07:16:12.320 align:start position:0%

07:16:15.190 --> 07:16:15.200 align:start position:0%

under
 
07:16:31.910 --> 07:16:31.920 align:start position:0%

i learned
 
07:16:36.548 --> 07:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
so much
 
07:16:36.558 --> 07:16:37.510 align:start position:0%
so much
from

07:16:37.510 --> 07:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:16:41.510 --> 07:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
him and my experience and if you still
 
07:16:42.948 --> 07:16:42.958 align:start position:0%

07:16:45.830 --> 07:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
brick wall award plaques on your wall do
 
07:16:45.840 --> 07:16:46.628 align:start position:0%
brick wall award plaques on your wall do
you

07:16:46.628 --> 07:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:17:02.388 --> 07:17:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:03.830 --> 07:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and members of
 
07:17:05.510 --> 07:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
the committee i'm gina balkas and i'm
 
07:17:07.510 --> 07:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
the ceo of the granite state home health
 
07:17:10.070 --> 07:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
and hospice association we represent
 
07:17:12.150 --> 07:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
home care hospice and palliative care
 
07:17:14.788 --> 07:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
providers and the people they serve
 
07:17:17.270 --> 07:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
so like mr kotrubus when this bill was
 
07:17:19.590 --> 07:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate we were neutral
 
07:17:21.030 --> 07:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
07:17:23.430 --> 07:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
because at the time the bill only had
 
07:17:26.628 --> 07:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
section one which was simply adding
 
07:17:28.388 --> 07:17:28.398 align:start position:0%
case management providers to the home
 
07:17:30.868 --> 07:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
health statute and and and i would agree
 
07:17:32.548 --> 07:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
that you know the word the fact that
 
07:17:34.948 --> 07:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
they arrange services qualifies them to
 
07:17:36.788 --> 07:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
be in that statute
 
07:17:38.628 --> 07:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
um i think that our concern and the
 
07:17:40.548 --> 07:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
reason that i'm here today is when i saw
 
07:17:42.708 --> 07:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
the bill as passed by the senate with
 
07:17:44.948 --> 07:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
the new definition i do believe the
 
07:17:47.990 --> 07:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
definition is overly broad and very
 
07:17:50.868 --> 07:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
confusing and um
 
07:17:53.030 --> 07:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
feel that the link much of the language
 
07:17:54.868 --> 07:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
that's in there about conflict-free case
 
07:17:57.990 --> 07:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
management applies only to
 
07:17:58.000 --> 07:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
management applies only to
um

07:17:59.110 --> 07:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:01.110 --> 07:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
federal waiver services
 
07:18:03.430 --> 07:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
you may in fact have case management
 
07:18:06.230 --> 07:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
service provider agencies out there that
 
07:18:07.910 --> 07:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
are private only
 
07:18:10.948 --> 07:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
and that do that do not do any
 
07:18:12.868 --> 07:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh waiver services
 
07:18:15.350 --> 07:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
so the definition should be
 
07:18:16.788 --> 07:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
much clearer
 
07:18:19.350 --> 07:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
um i feel that the department's
 
07:18:21.190 --> 07:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that was presented today
 
07:18:24.310 --> 07:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
achieves that i do believe that i saw
 
07:18:25.830 --> 07:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was presented to the
 
07:18:28.788 --> 07:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
senate it was different than what was
 
07:18:30.708 --> 07:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
presented today because it included a
 
07:18:32.310 --> 07:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
list of service providers who are
 
07:18:34.150 --> 07:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
exempted i think the amendment you have
 
07:18:36.310 --> 07:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
before you today is cleaner
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh and it just clarifies that agents you
 
07:18:41.990 --> 07:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
know that home that
 
07:18:43.670 --> 07:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
case management agencies would have
 
07:18:46.070 --> 07:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
their own paragraph and own definition
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
uh i think that um i have read the home
 
07:18:50.948 --> 07:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
health client bill of rights i think
 
07:18:53.510 --> 07:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that could easily still apply to case
 
07:18:55.270 --> 07:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
management agencies it could be applied
 
07:18:56.468 --> 07:18:56.478 align:start position:0%
in rural
 
07:18:58.788 --> 07:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
or the statute could simply be amended
 
07:19:01.190 --> 07:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
to add that case management agencies
 
07:19:02.868 --> 07:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
should provide the home care client's
 
07:19:04.388 --> 07:19:04.398 align:start position:0%
bill of rights
 
07:19:06.230 --> 07:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
but you know there are other sections of
 
07:19:08.628 --> 07:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
the law that apply including home care
 
07:19:10.708 --> 07:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
discharge regulations and other things
 
07:19:14.070 --> 07:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
like that so i just want to i i
 
07:19:16.150 --> 07:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
was hoping not to have to jump into this
 
07:19:18.150 --> 07:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
bill because it seems now that it's
 
07:19:20.628 --> 07:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
begun it's gotten a little controversial
 
07:19:22.788 --> 07:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
but i do feel the amount that the
 
07:19:25.270 --> 07:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
definition that was added by the senate
 
07:19:28.150 --> 07:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
is very confusing and will muddy the
 
07:19:30.310 --> 07:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
waters for
 
07:19:32.788 --> 07:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
for a range of health care providers
 
07:19:35.270 --> 07:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
that may in fact provide case management
 
07:19:38.230 --> 07:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
services under their existing licenses
 
07:19:40.868 --> 07:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
and now we'll look at this and say oh do
 
07:19:43.270 --> 07:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
i now need to be licensed separately
 
07:19:44.788 --> 07:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
because we provide some of these
 
07:19:47.910 --> 07:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
services so um i would ask that you give
 
07:19:49.510 --> 07:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
serious consideration to the
 
07:19:51.910 --> 07:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
department's amendment that they shared
 
07:19:54.310 --> 07:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
07:19:57.750 --> 07:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:59.590 --> 07:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative pierce thank you madam
 
07:20:02.708 --> 07:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
chair did we not just hear that
 
07:20:02.718 --> 07:20:03.910 align:start position:0%
chair did we not just hear that
under

07:20:03.910 --> 07:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
07:20:06.070 --> 07:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
part two basically line 15 on this
 
07:20:09.270 --> 07:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
definition is a federal definition
 
07:20:12.868 --> 07:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:15.670 --> 07:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of the definition
 
07:20:18.948 --> 07:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
is that the definition is is a federal
 
07:20:21.830 --> 07:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
definition that applies only to
 
07:20:25.190 --> 07:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
waive medicaid waiver services
 
07:20:25.200 --> 07:20:26.388 align:start position:0%
waive medicaid waiver services
not

07:20:26.388 --> 07:20:26.398 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:20:28.868 --> 07:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
services that might be applau provided
 
07:20:30.388 --> 07:20:30.398 align:start position:0%
by other
 
07:20:32.388 --> 07:20:32.398 align:start position:0%
case management agencies that don't have
 
07:20:35.910 --> 07:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
anything to do with waiver services
 
07:20:37.990 --> 07:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
so it would certainly be appropriate to
 
07:20:41.110 --> 07:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
have those definitions in the the waiver
 
07:20:43.430 --> 07:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
rules or the medicaid rules i don't
 
07:20:45.910 --> 07:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
think it it should be in the def the
 
07:20:51.350 --> 07:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:53.510 --> 07:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:20:57.030 --> 07:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:59.270 --> 07:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right i know
 
07:21:01.110 --> 07:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
07:21:02.468 --> 07:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who
 
07:21:07.430 --> 07:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on senate bill 333
 
07:21:09.670 --> 07:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'm going to close
 
07:21:10.868 --> 07:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
07:21:12.788 --> 07:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
we will not be voting on any of these
 
07:21:14.548 --> 07:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
bills today
 
07:21:16.788 --> 07:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
and i would hope
 
07:21:18.468 --> 07:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
that all members of the committee spend
 
07:21:22.868 --> 07:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
their weekend readings rsa 151
 
07:21:24.948 --> 07:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
and studying up on it there will be a
 
07:21:24.958 --> 07:21:26.868 align:start position:0%
and studying up on it there will be a
quiz

07:21:26.868 --> 07:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
quiz
 
07:21:28.548 --> 07:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
