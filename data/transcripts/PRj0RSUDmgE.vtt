Reed thank you so much Mr chair and
 
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee um I
 
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
asked the chair if he would um allow me
 
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to apologize to all of
 
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.350 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to apologize to all of
you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
and he very graciously agreed um so two
 
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I had a bill before you and
 
00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
you all have almost always treated me
 
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
with respect and professionalism and
 
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
heard my bills and and with a great deal
 
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 align:start position:0%
of of reason and um at the time someone
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
had uh testified against my bill and in
 
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
in that moment I felt very strongly that
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
um that person's testimony had
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized the bill and so I went
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
out into the Hall to speak with him
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
about that and um I was assertive and uh
 
00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 align:start position:0%
probably tonal and even confrontational
 
00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
with him but I want to be clear that
 
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
that was not what you all heard um when
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
he asked me to be quiet I was primed in
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
a in a mental state to interpret that in
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
the worst possible way um as if he was
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
being patronizing and I extremely loudly
 
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
in fact at the top of my lungs shouted
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and that was extremely unprofessional
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
of me I disrespected him I disrespected
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
this committee's work and I disrespected
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
the um proper procedure of the house and
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
for that I have to offer my um deepest
 
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
apologies to you all for doing that um I
 
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
want to be I I called Mr Klein last week
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
to apologize to him Direct directly and
 
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
we actually had a very good 15-minute
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
phone conversation he treated me with a
 
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
great deal of Grace and equin equinity
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
and reason and he said that he
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
understood why I would be um upset in
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
the moment and interpret things the way
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
I did he gave me his word that he did
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
not mean to be patronizing or sexist and
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
asking me to be quiet that it was he
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
would have said the same thing to anyone
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
and I take him at his word having no
 
00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
other reason to believe him to be that
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
kind of person and I believe that um he
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
is sincere in saying that so I want to
 
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
commend him for treating me graciously
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and um and make sure it's on record that
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that he was being
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
patronizing and that I do apologize to
 
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
this committee and I also would like it
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
as a matter of record that I certainly
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
did not intend to um treat anyone
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
differently because of a difference of
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
viewpoint that that it was specifically
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
that that I was responding to in my
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
incorrect In My incorrect interpretation
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
that I welcome disagreements and
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
engagement um with Civility and uh in
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
fact I believe that I have co-sponsored
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
and and testified for a great number of
 
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
bills from people of the opposite party
 
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
so I want to reaffirm my belief in
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
working with people who disagree and
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
once again very very deeply apologize to
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
this committee for disrupting you and
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
disrespecting you and disrespecting the
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
witnesses that came before you thank you

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative okay uh we are going to
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
start out by opening an executive
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
session on a house bill
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
1708 FN relative to local records
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 align:start position:0%

that um I'll just briefly speak to that
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
for you um HP 1708 the guts of the bill
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
incorporated into a Judiciary Bill and
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
that one I believe now has according to
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Lynn has been completely
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
brought into one of their bills and has
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
either made its way or is about to make
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
its way through the committee so this is
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
a a early Bill we have to get it done
 
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%

just uh like to note that I supported
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and would have
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
preferred it if we could have passed it
 
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves um the whole procedure here of
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
handing it off to the
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I think
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm just going to say I'm not
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
very happy with but um that being said
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
if the prime sponsors on board um
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
then fine let's itl it um but I do wish
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
we could have passed ourselves
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
though thank you just to be clear
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
it to them the um chairman of Judiciary
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
requested that we allow them to put the
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
guts of this bill in there I believe we
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
I spoke with the prime sponsor and he
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
did not have any opposition to
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%

limits under the elderly property tax
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
exemption I see the prime sponsor has
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
taken the seat represent representative

erery you are
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
what whatever you would like to
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
say thank you for the record my name is
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
Jordan erery representing Hillsboro 13
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson New Hampshire uh this
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
started off as a mere uh housekeeping
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
measure because the limits
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
on um the elderly exemption haven't been
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
changed in something in like 30 years as
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact if you take a look at
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
the strikeout for the numbers uh it's
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere around $1,000 for a single
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
individual somebody who is on Medicare
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
only as their uh form of U
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
supplement receiving roughly $2,000
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
would receive $24,000 so they're don't
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
meet the minimum
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
requirement because there's been no
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
adjustment of the require of the
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
minimums for married or single
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
applicants in a long period of time that
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed or there needs to
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
be an addition to this addressing it to
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
the CPI or in some fashion like that I
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
know that over and Ways and Means we've
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
done that several times with various
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh taxation programs so that we can
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
maintain a uh business deduction uh of
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
businesses based on the uh inflationary
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
value or devaluation of our
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
currency that was the primary thing then
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
as we got into it I looked add it this
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
section of law from both the ways and
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
means side and from the fact that I'm a
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
senior and there's a lot of people that
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
in town that come up to me in one of the
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
two coffee shops or three coffee shops
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
now uh saying uh can't get don't know
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
how why is that type of question we've
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
all received that kind of question and
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
we all know we take a look at it to see
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
what uh the situation is before we go
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
forward and in this particular instance
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
I found the elderly in my community are
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
being driven out of their homes quite
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
literally driven out of the community
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
because of an inability to pay in a
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
rapid diminu of their resources as we
 
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.150 align:start position:0%
rapid diminu of their resources as we
live

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
longer I'm approaching the maximum uh
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
age uh M fact I've exceeded the age of
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
death that was actually
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
actuar stated when I was born so
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I look around the room and there's
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
one or two other people that are in that
 
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.949 align:start position:0%
one or two other people that are in that
same

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
category this is something that the
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
legislature has not addressed regarding
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
such programs whether or not giving
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
elderly or the veterans or the blind or
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's not the policy the policy is
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
already in place the PO the question
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
here is what are the requirements to
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
qualify and nothing else changes on this
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
because it's up to the communities to
 
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
because it's up to the communities to
adopt

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
this all we're doing is increasing the
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
level at which the communities can
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
adopt now I'm just crusing some notes
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
that were handed to me earlier and then
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of uh questions
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
regarding wording Etc uh you everyone is
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that uh uh legislation
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
is created by attorneys that uh they use
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
their language they use their best
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation of which section of law
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
applies whether they made a mistake or
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
not we can adjust that as we go along uh
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
but as you know that's that's uh
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
something that uh that takes care uh
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
that is taken care of in uh a variety of
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
off reccord
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.389 align:start position:0%
off reccord
committees

00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:00.990 align:start position:0%
committees
by

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the current minimums and
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
essentially doubling them I used round
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
number to double it up to a round
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
number um we are creating more people
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
may be coming eligible for it but we're
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
also allowing more older people who are
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income to remain in their
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
houses for that
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
time by modifying the fixed
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
assets we're allowing them to enjoy that
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
period of time so that they
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
can uh continue to live in their Pro
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
their homes and they can continue to
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
participate in the community by perhaps
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
going out to dinner once in a while
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
going out to breakfast once in a while
 
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.389 align:start position:0%
going out to breakfast once in a while
buying

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
buying
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
groceries once in a
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
while that is an issue in my community
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
even though Hudson has a reputation of
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
not being one of the PO poorer
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
communities in the uh area there are
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
still individuals
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
that occasionally need some
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
assistance by modifying that those areas
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're allowing people to stay in their
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
homes for the rest of their natural
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
lives but we've also capped the amount
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
of uh tax deductions that we've included
 
00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:22.910 align:start position:0%
of uh tax deductions that we've included
in

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
here so try to balance between the two
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the committee will look
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
favorably upon
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
this I hate to say it but it's for the
 
00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:37.710 align:start position:0%
this I hate to say it but it's for the
old

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
folks I'll be glad to answer any
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair okay thank you
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
representative yok
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
the question um it seems like the
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
law allows it to that the town or city
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
choose any amount as long it is not less
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
than um the amount stated and so by
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
increasing that amount you're actually
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount the option of the of
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities to choose a number
 
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
let's say less than the number that
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
you've chosen and greater than the
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
current number um I'm looking at lines
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
25 and
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
26 would
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
you what is your opposition to towns
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
choosing let's say 20 5,000 as the
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
number that they choose what why why
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
should a town not be able to do
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
that I'm not reading that the same
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
um but 25,000 30,000 and I'm no
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
objection that particular number needs
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
to be increased to reflect the
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
devaluation of of our dollar that has
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
decades representative
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for taking
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you for being here
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
and uh addressing this problem um my
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
question is how were the figures that's
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
um how how are they come how did they
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
come about did you um get some Financial
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
experts to try to to bring them up to
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
the a reasonable standard I'm just
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
curious no no Financial experts no I I
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
relied upon the information they
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
received over wage and means regarding
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
what the uh U minimum uh wages and the
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
the uh um demographic data that is
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
provided to us regarding uh minimum
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
incomes and then I looked at an average
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
of an individual who's making uh single
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
individual are receiving Medicare it's
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
going to be somewhere around $2,000
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
19900 uh I don't think anyone really
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
makes 15 anymore after the recent
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
increases it's going to be around 19 to
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
22 so I just essentially doubled it from
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
that go ahead represent thank you for
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
letting me speak um did you uh ask the
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson to kind of give you a
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
kind of fiscal impact of what this would
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
do to their
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
revenue no but I did put a a revenue cap
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
in there uh on a single on Prop property
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
the uh page whatever it is two down at
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom it says no event shall the
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
relief Grant to be greater than 10,000
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
five in order to do that I did not re
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
request information from the town of
 
00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.950 align:start position:0%
request information from the town of
Hudson

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hudson
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
because this would be applied not just
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
to Hudson but to the entire State and
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
Dr further questions representative
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so the
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
question I have is that uh a lot of
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
people have different assets up here in
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
section 1A U different assets including
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
stocks and bonds and everything like
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
that that uh that people depend on to
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
draw on we'll say through interest that
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
type of thing for their livelihood why
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
assets for exactly the reasons that you
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
just stated they draw upon it in order
 
00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.029 align:start position:0%
just stated they draw upon it in order
to

00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
live up go ahead so if I had $3 million
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
in assets and I was drawing on those
 
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
in assets and I was drawing on those
interests

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
um to support myself that's okay so
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on that I wouldn't U
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
place the limit on on that because $3
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
million in today's environment will
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
probably last you just a few
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
for the work I also have the white hair
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
and Paul category in fact I I'm I'm I'm
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
one of those border line ones uh that uh
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
can't quite qualify but we're we're
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
changing our parameters to a maximum of
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
$70,000 for for uh married couple so
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot easier for me to
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
qu qualify if I can but I have a
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
question on uh page two uh line 31 and
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
32 section section 4 what what does that
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
mean and why is that necessary to be in
 
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
mean and why is that necessary to be in
this

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
bill because you could wind up uh from
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
some of the fears that uh representative
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
Brown was alluding to with an individual
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
who has a a great deal of uh uh residual
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
income that has gained over the years uh
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
from this would limit the liability of
 
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:26.789 align:start position:0%
from this would limit the liability of
the

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
community um and that was the reason it
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
was put in so it would be no greater
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
than 10 nor less than five so someone
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
would have a base of five that they
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
would get and uh take my community for
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
example uh the tax rate runs 6 to8 uh
 
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.149 align:start position:0%
example uh the tax rate runs 6 to8 uh
roughly

00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
68 something like that gu Hudson's
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
behind me but
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh so this is to Pro uh protect the town
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat from if somebody owns a big a
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
large home still qualifies for the
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
money's area even though they have the
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
extra money so they got a relief but
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to pay any
 
00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:10.110 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to pay any
more

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
than uh was it $10,000 in their tax
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
relief so if they get a tax bill of say
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
12,000 they only would get 10,000 relief
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
that that that would be correct sir I
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
might usually at the other
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
end my property's worth about 140,000 so
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
so well you're your m is a town property
 
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than that yeah so
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you anyway thank you for your
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
effort thank you Mr
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative frct
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
question um as long as the proverbial
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
hood is up on this RSA and we're
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
tinkering with it I have two questions
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
um on Roman numeral
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
2A um the requirement is for residency
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
state and what is the logic for state
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
residency versus the
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipality which is being applied to
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
exemption I'm not exactly sure on that
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
Sirah because if you'll not all I did
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
was change the number of years in
 
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.310 align:start position:0%
was change the number of years in
existing

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
law right I I do I do understand that
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
and then what I did was let's make it a
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
long-term resident rather than a
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
short-term resident who may be engaged
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
in property
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
flipping okay uh followup Mr chair go
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
ahead uh my second question um Roman
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
3D uh again thew logic behind the uh
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
applicant being married for five years
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay hold on hold on hold on
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative um again a reminder to
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee only
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
bolded type is what's being changed the
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
3D there's no change
 
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
3D there's no change
there

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't really think there's we need
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
to get go down that road is existing
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's existing language not not not
 
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.950 align:start position:0%
it's it's existing language not not not
being

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
amended further questions representa
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
question how many communities are
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
currently using this exemption in their
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh local governments it would be up to
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
each Community to adopt it and I'm not
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
sure how many have adopted it or not I
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
know that mine has and and it is used Mr
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
chairman followup go ahead how many
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
households or indiv elderly individuals
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
do you know are currently using this
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
exemption I'm not aware of that number
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and followup Mr chair no
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
you don't ask questions well can I
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
continue to answer that one you may
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
answer if you you've got more
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
you the specifics of individual ual
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
household incomes are not priv are
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
privileged under Dr regulation I could
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
get a WR round number but it would be an
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh an
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
in uninformative number because it would
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
include uh too broad of a scale so it'
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
useless further
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions represent Gilman thank you Mr
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you thank you for taking
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
my question U my question's kind of uh
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
procedural I guess um this is
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
a an amendment to 7239 B but 7239 a
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
references this uh using the same
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that you want to change so my
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
question is um shall we work on an
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
amendment check with uh legislative
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
services wrote it they picked out which
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
ones belong where okay thank
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
you and that may in fact be an issue but
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's one that I think that's
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
more of an edit a mistake rather than
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
a sending it to the wrong place uh
 
00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:49.190 align:start position:0%
a sending it to the wrong place uh
further

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative um as we increase the
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
amount of uh exemptions for one group of
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
people in town is it am I correct in
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
assuming any loss revenue from those
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
Source will be redistributed and pulled
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the individuals in town
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
all that would generally be the form and
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happens under the
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
current law that uh others are taking
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
care of those uh in town with uh less um
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
um means of uh accomplishing
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh life goals uh
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
however it's also incumbent upon the
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
community to make changes and to mon uh
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
moderate their own
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
operations to allow individuals who
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
reside in their Community to continue to
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
reside in their
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
homes okay thank you further
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you for your
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
testimony next up we will call
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
Bartlet I will remind those who are
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
going to testify please when you uh
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself also State whether
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
you're for or against we know up here
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
from your cards but the rest of the
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
individuals do
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
not thank you uh Mr chair and members of
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
the committee allowing me to testify um
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Bartlett I am the
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
assessor of the town of gtown um I do
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill as it is currently
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
written and my select board has
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
authorized me to speak to you today in
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
opposition to this uh bill again as
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
currently written um the the main issues
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
that we are opposed to are
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
um the net Asset definition and the the
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
range of the $5,000 to $10,000 um
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
minimum relief start with the assets um
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
on line line five of page of page one it
 
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.950 align:start position:0%
on line line five of page of page one it
redefines

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
redefines
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
assets uh to not include investment
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
funds not being cashed in or withdrawn
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
except that any I'm not going to read
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
the whole thing but essentially what
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
this is doing is saying that investment
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
funds are no longer considered to be
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
assets and I think representative Brown
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
kind of touched on this you could have
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of assets but still
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
qualify for the exemption I don't think
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the elderly
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
exemption by redefining this in this way
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
it also creates uh what I consider to be
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
an very inequitable situation depending
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
upon what type of retirement plan an
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
individual has um just last week I had
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
an in a couple come in we are currently
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
at the maximum of
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
$60,000 um of income same as this this
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
bill would do so we have no objection to
 
00:29:57.679 --> 00:29:58.789 align:start position:0%
bill would do so we have no objection to
that

00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
change but essentially this couple came
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
in and their retirement plan was Social
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
Security and a pension they had limited
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
investment funds they made
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
$62,000 they did not
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
qualify but if this change were to be
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
made to the definition of assets you
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
could have an individual who has again
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in Assets in in
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
investment funds they could take2 to
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year out of those investment
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
funds but they would qualify into this
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
definition that does not seem to be
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
Equitable and you know we do have an
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
objection to that the other issue that
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
we have a objection to is
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
the just going to again find the line
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's line 31 to 32 on page
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
two this says in no event shall the
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
amount of relief granted be greater than
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
$10,000 or less than $5,000
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
well right now our maximum relief for a
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
um for an elderly over the age of 80 is
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
$2,600 so just this alone if we were to
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
make the minimum
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
$5,000 that would raise our tax rate in
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
town by 13 cents per thousand again that
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a lot but it is an
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
increase that's just taking this into
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
consideration with 182 elderly that we
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
currently have if the definition of
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
assets also changes we are going to
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
increase that number how many I don't
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
know I can't give you an estimate of
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
that right now but I'm pretty sure we
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
will increase that
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
number the other issue I have with this
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
range of relief is that the elderly
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
exemption is an exemption it's a certain
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
amount off of the assessed value it is
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
not a credit so we're taking an
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
exemption and putting a what almost like
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
a credit amount on that it would be
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
to to administer that way because we
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what the until we get the tax
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
rate from the Dr we don't know how much
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
that relief is going to be the exemption
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
is set beforehand it's part of our
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
filing our
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
ms1 but again for me to set that at
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
$5,000 it would mean I would have to
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
calculate after the tax rate is already
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
set I do have written testimony that I
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
will leave here for you I haven't
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
touched on everything um but those are
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
the main issues that we are opposed to
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
um and I would be open to any
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your testimony
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
representative priest go ahead thank you
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and thank you for
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
being here have you had a um I know this
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
is lot lot to ask you but have you taken
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
a moment to kind of calculate what kind
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
of a fiscal impact this if this bill was
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
passed it would have for the town of
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
gost toown and how high the other
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
property taxes would have to be brought
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
you know risen to
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
um to meet this
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh the deficit that would come from
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
these properties um really the only
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
thing I did on that was at the the
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
minimum to the maximum the $5,000 to
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
$10,000 as I said that would have a 13 C
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
per th000 impact on our tax rate it
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
would increase our tax rate by 13 cents
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
the other parts of this again it all
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
would depend on how many more people
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
would qualify because of these
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
definitions um the income limit is not
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
an issue we are currently at 60,000 for
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
a married couple 42,500 for single the
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
asset limit would matter a little bit
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
because we are currently at
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
180,000 um but again I don't think those
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
are really the main issues we have if if
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
it went to 350,000 and that was the will
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
of the the legislature we would abide by
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
that the real issue is that new
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
definition of assets that's where we
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
to do you have a follow-up br
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh but you also have an issue with
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
um the amount of relief
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
granted of5 to 10,000 that is correct
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Scott for coming and
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
testifying uh I I I have a in in my town
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
There's been about three times there's
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
been an article on a warrant to forgive
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
all taxes anybody over 85 I think they
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
took on the basis that they've paid
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
their dues over their life span and they
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taxed when they get to be
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
85 whatever or whatever uh age do you
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
think that that that's the rationale
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
when this bill was set up that the
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
rationale was anybody in these in these
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
categories should be forgiven their
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
taxes because of the reason would be uh
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
that they are entitled because of the
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
number of years to pay tax okay um thank
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
you for the question um if that's the
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
rationale of this bill it would not it
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
does not do that because like I said the
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
couple I had last week who earned
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
$62,000 under this bill they would still
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
not qualify because they're over the
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
income limit
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay I understand so there are the
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
parameters don't produce the
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
the the question of anybody getting
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
everybody getting their tax
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
relieved at a particular age no matter
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
how much they would
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
make under this bill I I agree with what
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
you just said yes yeah thank
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:24.829 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
um if under the the logic of this bill
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh what you kind of alluded to no uh no
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
event shall the amount of relief be
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
granted less than $5,000 so if the a
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
$4,500 the town would not be able to
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
grant them relief because it wasn't at
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
least $5,000 and the law says that no
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
relief granted shall be less than
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
$5,000 um thank you for the question um
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
I I'll be honest I'm a little confused
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
by the language here because if you do
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
have someone who whose taxes are
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
$4,000 does that mean that the town
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
would then have to pay them
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
$1,000 I'm not I'm unsure of that that
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the questions I raised in my
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
my written testimony I really wasn't
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
going to get into that but thank you for
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
bringing that
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
up further
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one quick
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
one for you do you um monitor um the
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
total percent tax impact on
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
non um exemption claimers in your town
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
for I'm going to give you an example in
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
my town of barington I went to
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
my Town Administrator and
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
said if no exe exemptions
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
existed how far would the taxpayers
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
bills go down the other taxpayers who do
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
not pay claim any exemptions and I
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
believe at that time it was about a year
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
ago was about a five and a half perc
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
decrease in the overall tax do you track
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
that I have that information I did I've
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
never put it in a percentage like that I
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
can tell you just from the numbers that
 
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
I have on my written
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um if the if there was no
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
elderly exemption the tax rate would
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
probably be about 10 to 12 cents Le less
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
than it currently is just on that one I
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
was looking okay thank you very much
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
would you be able to run uh send in that
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
number by chance if you looked at all of
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to compare it between
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
barington and you said you were go down
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
yes so you're looking for the percentage
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
of all exemptions and credits yeah I
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
would just like to if you have that
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
handy don't I mean don't go through it
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that that information is right on
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
the ms1 okay it's very easy to to get
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
that information so I'd be glad to send
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
that in I'd love it thank you further
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh seeing no more for you
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh next up we have Jim mishel thank
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair may I pass out my testimony
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:32.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jim Misha I'm the
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
chief assessor for the town of Hudson I
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
have not registered uh in favor or
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill because the Hudson
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
Board of selectman have not directly uh
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
issued a uh an opinion on this bill so
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here mostly talking about the
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
administrative part there are some
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
policy Parts as well um this is a really
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
important tax exemption program in the
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
state um we uh annually are are in this
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
process of people applying um our
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
assessment review process with the
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
Department Revenue they monitor how we
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
Grant exemptions not just the elderly
 
00:40:11.069 --> 00:40:11.079 align:start position:0%
exemption um and it's been a really long
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
time since these amounts were looked
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
that it was in the 1995 1996 General
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
Court under house bill
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
331 um it took two legislative years and
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
a study committee um to arrive at the
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
language that you pretty much see in in
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
the law today um in 2022 according to
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
the Dr there was $1.1 billion dollar in
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
elderly exemption value that's been
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
Exempted um and that would be $5,000 in
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
Exempted taxable value in Su all the way
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
up to 145.5 million in Exempted value in
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
Nashua um in terms of tax dollars it's
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
about $28.6 million in property tax
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
redistribution so it's it's Revenue
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
neutral right so the tax rate goes up to
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
value I do have attached a series of
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill um number one on
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
my page three um has been addressed it's
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
most likely an OS uh item um lines
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
number two lines four through S talks
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
about investment funds uh that been
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
discussed prior um currently what we uh
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
don't count as an asset is the house
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
right so a person's actual residence up
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
to two acres or the Zone minimum is
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
Exempted we cannot count that as an
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
asset um not allowing the community to
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
count investment funds as an asset is a
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
rather significant expansion in assets
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
that would not be counted um so you know
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
one would imagine that we'd have more
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
people qualifying which is the intent of
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
the bill but there's also an impact to
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
that right um and also in terms of
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
investment funds it's not defined you
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
know we might want to Define what an
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
investment fund is there's 234 communi
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
we might have 235 different ways of
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
deciding what an investment fund is if
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have some
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
direction uh M number three again on
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
lines 4 through 7 um says that required
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
minimum distributions shall be uh
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
classed as an
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
asset um currently the IRS counts that
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
as ordinary income currently our
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
communities count that as income it's
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
money coming in from a required minimum
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
distribution um I don't know what it is
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
is if it's it is income you know calling
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
it asset is I don't know is is
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
opinion beyond that on my page four um
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
lines 20 through 21 this speaks to The
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
Residency requirement to change from
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
three years of state of residency within
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
the state to five it actually used to be
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
five years uh Senator Jack Barnes I want
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
to say a long time ago probably about 15
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
years ago um had it changed from 5 to
 
00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:56.710 align:start position:0%
years ago um had it changed from 5 to
three

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
um the legislature agreed with that um
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of problematic if this passes
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
right because I have some folks that
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
were here for three years right for this
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
year then this passes then next year
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
they'll only have been here for four
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
years so I guess we removed their
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
exemption or there's a Cil added to the
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not sure
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
um SEC uh my uh section my number five
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh under no circumstances and the
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
changeing the income amounts from 30,000
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
for single to 60,000 per married um the
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
significant increase right in the in the
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
minimums about over 200% increase in
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
both categories um all in one year um so
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no Glide path on it
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
right and other bits of legislation
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
we've had Glide paths and how the
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
minimums are going to be increased um
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
also we want to be sensitive to the
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
demographic uh economics of the state um
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
so the per capita income just on County
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
Alone um for for bellnap I'm sorry for
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
Coos County is
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
3,829 and in Rockingham it's 51,6 127 so
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
we're establishing higher minimums but
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
the state really has really far
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
different per capita incomes and medium
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
family incomes um and I'm not sure how
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
we address that right we have a state
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
law applies to every Community um but I
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
think you just want to be sensitive to
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
the the money made in Portsmouth is a
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the money made
 
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the money made
in

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh according to the Dr um the
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
medium income amount currently across
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
the whole state is 25,000 for
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
single um and for married the median
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
income amount and this is all of the um
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
all of the exemption amounts that have
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
been adopted within each Community uh
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
that Min median income amount is
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
36,000 just to put in in perspective 59%
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the communities are under 30,000 and
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
92% of the communities are under 60,000
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
so this would change things in those
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
communities um my number six um this
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
deals with life insurance on the death
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
this is lines 28 through 29 in the bill
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
sorry um life insurance paid on the
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
death of an insured is currently um
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
Exempted as an asset um that's been in
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
place for decades um this would now have
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
the community count that as as an asset
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
so um that's kind of going this way and
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's going this way a little bit in the
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
bill um lines 28 on page one and lines 1
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
through two on page two um says we are
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
to uh exclude revenue from investment
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
funds redeemed in any given year um
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
again currently we we count that as
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
income um and and that would have that
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
would have an impact upon the
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
community section8 my section eight my
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
page six lines seven through eight um
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
changes the asset amount from
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
35,000 to
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
350,000 or the median residential
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
property value in the
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
community again looking at some
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
statistics from the Dr currently 256
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
communities are under 350,000 in asset
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
limit just just a few just three are
 
00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:17.829 align:start position:0%
limit just just a few just three are
over

00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
350,000 um so it' be probably
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
significant change uh in Hudson as well
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
in Hudson our Exempted asset limit is
 
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.390 align:start position:0%
in Hudson our Exempted asset limit is
160,000

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
160,000
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
um still staying with that same section
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
it says median residential property
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
value whichever is lower we should
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
Define what is median residential
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
property value is it just single family
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
Does it include accessory living units
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
Does it include mixed use property um
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
small multifamilies you know we want to
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
make sure if we're going to administer
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
it we all administer it the same way um
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
and does it get arrived at annually only
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
after a reevaluation some other cycle um
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
who determines the value is it is it the
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
governing body the legislative body is
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
it subject to Amendment amendment by
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
attendees at a deliberative session is
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
the determination
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
appealable um and lastly and I'll finish
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
up lines 31 through 32 says in no event
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
shall the amount of relief granted be
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
greater than 10 or less than five we
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
would not know that until the tax bills
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
were already arrived at so we would and
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
I don't so we couldn't do it before the
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
bills went out and we couldn't do it as
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
a as an abatement legally after the
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
bills come out so that kind of doesn't
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
work within the property tax
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
administration within the
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
state um beyond that um I think I said
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
it was Revenue neutral um and in Hudson
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
um we are twice now last year we
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
increased our uh income amount uh as
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
well as our the amount of our exemptions
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
this year we're increasing the income
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
amount again and the amount of the
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
Exempted value per category um so
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
Community has the ability to do that
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
right they can raise the amounts um if
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
the voters approve it um in Hudson we
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
have about 179 properties that receive
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
the ELD of the exemption it is about 2
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
and a half cents on the tax rate so
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
every Community is going to be different
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
um but in Hudson um the the median I
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
should say the the amount of taxes
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
Exempted are between 2100 and 3600
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
currently right between the first age
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
level category up to the maximum age
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.230 align:start position:0%
level category up to the maximum age
category

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
um is a mandatory exemption every
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
Community has this right at the minimums
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
at minimum so um they can expand it they
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
just can't go lower than what's
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
currently there um at Hudson it takes
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
about 12 a half million in Exempted
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
value to change the tax rate by a penny
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
we have a little less than 30 million in
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
Exempted uh elderly exemption
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
value threw a lot at you there's more in
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
there and I'll take any questions thank
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
you very much for Testimony uh
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so towards the end there Mr
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
Mishu thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh you do a very very thorough job on
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
these bills when you come in thank you
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
for that so my question is you seem to
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
indicate that you have the ability to
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
legally do these things already in the
 
00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson to increase the
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions and can you explain how that
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
works without the law being changed
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sure um so um we can't change
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
how what's considered an asset right
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's this does that right but we can
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
change through Warren article right
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
we're a town SP2 um so Warr article
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
either goes on because the Bor of
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
selectman offer it or the Warr article
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
Goes On by petition and they say we want
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
to raise or lower it's always raise
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
raise the amount of the income allowed
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
raise the amount of assets allowed raise
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of exemption allowed which is
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
not in here um and under the the current
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
law you know those also have not been
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted for a very long time the
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
minimum EX exemption amount so so that
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
and in cities it's different obviously
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
Town Council communities uh Charter form
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
of government um but the voters vote on
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
it or our representatives vote on it
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
alderan thank you very
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um just to
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
clarify the
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
the impetus for this bill is that there
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
needed to be some inflationary change as
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
far as the minimum um but it seems to me
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
that your testimony says that the the
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
communities are already empowered to do
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
those changes as they see fit um in the
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
law as it stands and so no actual change
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
is needed to allow them to do that in
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
inflationary adjustment if they so
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
choose that's correct they can currently
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
do it thank
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
you all right I have one more pin card
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
HMA thank
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
you good morning Mr chairman and members
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
is Katherine heck representing the New
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and I
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
think you've heard from some of our
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
assessing experts some of the technical
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
concerns that exist within the bill um
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
Not only would it change the law and
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
create a mandate for cities and towns
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
that already can increase the exemption
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
and the income limits but there also is
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
a mixing of exemption versus credit um
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
within the law and we've been here many
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
times testimony testifying on how we
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
either need to have an exemption or a
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
credit but we certainly can't mix the
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
two together one happens before the tax
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
rate is set on April 1st when we show
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
our taxable inventory
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
and one happens after the tax rate is
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
set in December I did want to point out
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
just for interest the wide variety how
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
each town in New Hampshire might be
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
addressing this situation when they see
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal stress in their Community
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
especially around their elderly
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
populations on how they might be
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
addressing this locally for example um
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon has um a single
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
income limit of
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
45,000 and a married income asset limit
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
of of 100,000 the city of Manchester has
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
a single income limit of 41,000 and a
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
married asset limit of
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
13,000 molten Boro as another example
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
has a single income limit of 25,000 and
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
a married asset limit of 100 but then we
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
go to Northampton where they have a
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
married a single income limit hold on
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
let me just make sure I'm of four
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
$40,800 but a married income asset limit
 
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
$40,800 but a married income asset limit
of

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
$190,000 and then we'll go go to
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmith for another example just to
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
highlight the wide variety to address
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
this where a single income limit in
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
46,2 and the married income limit and
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
the single asset limit are both half a
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
million so each Community for itself is
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
deciding how best to address this you'll
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
also see the exemption itself being
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
wildly varied in the amount that will be
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
reduced off the assessed valuation of
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
the property for example with Hudson
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
offering 80 plus individuals
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
$240,000 off their assessment molten
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
Boro 100,000 off Northampton 200
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth 335,000 um and NASA 280,000
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
so again each Community for itself and
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
these reports are right available on the
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
Dr website we can give you the links
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
show what each Community has decided to
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
adopt locally to address the elderly
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
exemption in their community using the
 
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
minimums and current law as The
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
Benchmark and increasing as they um see
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their community so I'll
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
certainly take any
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for taking
 
00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:12.670 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for taking
my

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
question you didn't state if if the
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
municipal Association was in support or
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to this thank you we are opposed
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
to this legislation it would create a a
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
mandate I apologize thank you uh uh
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
follow please uh and in your estimation
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill um regarding the net
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
asset changes as well as the uh the
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
amount of relief
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
granted what impact would you H see in
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
these communities so again we haven't
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
worked up a study to examine that
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
carefully but generally when we expand
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
definitions and we expand the exemptions
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
or credits we will see the taxes
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
redistributed to
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
other every other taxpayer in the
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
community whether it's commercial or
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
residential but we will also see it um
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
change the disabled the deaf the Blind
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
and the veterans tax credits right
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
because everything gets redistribute
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
into the pi so if you change one and you
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't look at the other exemptions and
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
credits you could be disproportionately
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
member representative Yella thank you um
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
so this creates a mandate on the towns
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
to have at least um 30,000 for an
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
individual in your research did you find
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
any towns that this would bar their
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
current um
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
chosen uh relief yes I believe sorry oh
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
I I believe Jim um Misha from Hudson

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
13 we go and uh I am on the planning
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
board in Hudson and that is the emphasis
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
this I had did have some input from the
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh Municipal Association regarding it
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh they actually called and uh discussed
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
it this bill I don't know why they
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
didn't call and discuss the other bill
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
but yeah that's them at any
 
00:58:27.319 --> 00:58:29.349 align:start position:0%
but yeah that's them at any
rate

00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh the impetus of this is some
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
individuals around the state in various
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
boards tend to forget that when they're
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
acting as a member of the planning board
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're acting as a member of a board
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
and they're acting in a uh quasi
 
00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
judicial manner on most of the actions
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
have even when the mandated
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
um master plan is being discussed
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
they're still receiving information from
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
the public and they need to judge that
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
in a quasi judicial manner as opposed to
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh a partisan
 
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:16.750 align:start position:0%
uh a partisan
manner

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
so the details of it are based upon
 
00:59:24.079 --> 00:59:26.549 align:start position:0%
so the details of it are based upon
experience

00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that the uh committee
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
will bring some clarity Statewide to the
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
operation of planning boards and I'll be
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions okay thank you uh

page
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
one establishing that the planning board
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
is a quasi judicial
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
administrative agency and if
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
so what does that
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
mean uh thank you for your
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
question yes and it means that it is a
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial body which is the way
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh Municipal Association in
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
their handbook for planning boards
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
defines the activities of the planning
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
board all this does is take what has
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
been a non-mandatory
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.349 align:start position:0%
been a non-mandatory
uh

01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion by the municipal Association
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
is to the operation of a planning board
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
and puts it into law so that the
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
planning boards know they have to take a
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
look at an applicant who's coming before
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
them with a site plan that they have to
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at it like this not from a
 
01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.230 align:start position:0%
take a look at it like this not from a
partisan

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint um unfortunately that that's
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
happened as uh the good representative
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
knows from personal experience
 
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.549 align:start position:0%
knows from personal experience
follow

01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
up um under 673 colon 14
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
disqualification of
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
member uh Roman 1 it says that the board
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
decide in a judicial
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
capacity um relative to Bing uh planning
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
boards and cbas building codes um
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
historic districts Etc so I'm just a
 
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.109 align:start position:0%
historic districts Etc so I'm just a
little

01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
don't

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
understand if this will somehow
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
change this well the number one the
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
planning board currently is not a
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
Judicial body that says in a Judicial
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
manner capacity correct right sorry all
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
this does is establish the ability for
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
the board itself to be established as a
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial body it doesn't fall
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
under the Judiciary statute it falls
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
under the administrative statute but
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's operating in the quas judicial
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
banner and the same way the DMV in their
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
civil actions operates in a quasa
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
Judicial manner thank you very
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
much representative priest thank you for
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
being here uh having served planning
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
boards for 45 years in in my past life I
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate this effort of uh putting in
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing on the planning
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
boards and where sometimes not is this a
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
problem um in Hudson now or other
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
communities I'm not going to speak for
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
Hudson because if you're a member of the
 
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
planning board you have no standing as
 
01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.430 align:start position:0%
planning board you have no standing as
an

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual having experience with Hudson
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.990 align:start position:0%
and other
communities

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
occasionally individuals forget that
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
they're part of a board and think that a
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
decision can be made on their own behalf
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
this has happened not only with the
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
planning board or with the Zoning Board
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
of a um I forget the name of zoning
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
board or even select boards where
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
individuals have acted on their own be
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
behal as opposed to the fact that
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
they're a member of the board and so
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
what this does does is create a
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide standard for the planning
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
board that comports with existing
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the municipal
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
Association under best
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
um information regarding um the
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
presentation of uh information that may
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
or may not be misleading uh when a
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
person is making a representation to the
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
board and that's you know that's
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
something we have to deal with here uh
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
in our own committees at times where
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps the information related is not
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily as um accurate as could have
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
enough representative
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
yulla thank you on page four um lines 6
 
01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:57.390 align:start position:0%
yulla thank you on page four um lines 6
through

01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
14 um it talks about how if an applicant
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
um can request the recusal of a specific
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
board member and that the board shall
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
immediately suspend further hearings on
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
the matter immediately before the
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
board um and essentially uh you know
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
schedule a new public hearing and
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
address the that isue but um isn't uh
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
some of
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
the requirements of planning boards that
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
they um continue or or decide on certain
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
issues in a certain matter of time based
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
on statute and so
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
if they were required by law to figure
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
out something in let's say 60 days and
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
this is the 60th day and they got a
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
an a request for recusal at the
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
beginning of that meeting would now they
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
be in non-compliance with another
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
statute if they followed your statute
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
and and vice versa no I call your
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
attention lines 12 and 13 uh a delay to
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing to hear the recusal request
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
shall stay the determinate determination
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
time schedule for the board to uh render
 
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.990 align:start position:0%
time schedule for the board to uh render
a

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.309 align:start position:0%
 
decision

01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
delay to hear the recusal shall stay the
 
01:06:28.039 --> 01:06:29.269 align:start position:0%
delay to hear the recusal shall stay the
time

01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
schedule for the board to render a
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
decision on the delay on the on the
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
request for a recusal or for the the
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
subd develop the development that
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
they're currently trying to decide on
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
when they got the the language was
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
designed to cover the The Proposal that
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
was so that the time schedule the 60-day
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
calendar is stayed when a request for
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
recusal is made so that the an
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
obligation is not so it would be done
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
frivolously but that it would stay it
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
until a decision is made so when the
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
decision is made come when the board
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
comes back and and and has a decision on
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
or a hearing actually on the request for
 
01:07:14.319 --> 01:07:16.309 align:start position:0%
or a hearing actually on the request for
recusal

01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
recusal
 
01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:17.829 align:start position:0%
recusal
recusal

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
recusal
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
then the the clock would start after
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
represent FR I saw your hand up yes
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I promise this time I
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
will confine my question to bolded items
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
only um on page
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
one um looking at lines 13 and
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
14 I wondering if you could give us some
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
examples of when a board
 
01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.020 align:start position:0%

01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
um require uh information under oath as
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
shall depends on the proposal coming
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
uh let's say that a particular developer
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
has a um known
 
01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
history I would think it would be best
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
business practice for a uh uh quasi
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
judicial body to require uh indiv like a
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
loyalist individual uh to use a broad
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
very very very very broad
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
comparison uh that that individual
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
provide testimony under oath uh then
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
maybe some individual on the board uh
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
has an issue with one person While
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
others do not this may be a method for
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
them to take that or it could be
 
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
stricken and it could be said that any
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh written uh information provent uh
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
provided is done under unsworn um
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
falsification uh that's you know that's
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's up to the this committee uh the
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
way it goes thank you for answering my
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
question yes sir representative

nine
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
where if a board member has an interest
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
direct interest in a parcel
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
underdevelopment the member must
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
disqualify themselves from the
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
discussion what is the difference
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
between recusal and
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
disqualification recusal would be
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
refraining from engaging in the
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
discussion at the time where a
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
disqualification says you were
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
one is a voluntary activity and the
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
other is a mandatory Activity thank you
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair thank
 
01:10:34.679 --> 01:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair thank
you

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
um under Roman 9ine line
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
22 if a board member has a direct
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
interest this is under conflict of
 
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
interest this is under conflict of
interest

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
disqualifications if a board member has
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
a direct interest in a parcel
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
underdevelopment I've seen the
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh the
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
term interest in the
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
outcome in uh other like zoning board
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
rules I think for
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
disqualification um and I wonder
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
if direct interest is too vague does it
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
defined I would say no because that
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's a term of art direct interest
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
means that you have a monetary um
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
interest in the uh the project you have
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
a direct interest in interest is mod is
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
in my world downstairs that means you
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
have a monetary interest or uh um
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
benefit being derived from that
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
particular project
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
clarification uh followup go ahead thank
 
01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.270 align:start position:0%
clarification uh followup go ahead thank
you

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
um so in other statute it says um
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
personal or pecuniary interest is that
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing uh no because you have
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
two different things a personal interest
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
would be let's say uh a personal
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
interest would be um maintaining a
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
wooded lot because you have a nice view
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
of a forest as opposed to pecuniary Ines
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
which means developing that lot would
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
give you a sizable
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
s Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um this is
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
very clear to me U what your intentions
 
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
are I was just wondering if um what you
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
have added is really what you recommend
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
to the rules of procedure for planning
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
board I'm so I'm I'm wondering if what
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting and the new things of
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
what you know outlining what a planning
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
board needs to consider in their
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
application are really the things um
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
that you're recommending be put in the
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
um set of rules of procedures when you
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
require that I'm just trying to simplify
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
how the board's goingon to if the
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
board's going to change or I the board
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't change that much uh those
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
boards that are following the guidelines
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
set up by the new New Hampshire
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association are pretty much
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
doing this to begin with I know that
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
Hudson adopted uh a set of um bylaws for
 
01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.030 align:start position:0%
Hudson adopted uh a set of um bylaws for
operation

01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
recommend um that was recommended by the
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and was also
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
recommended uh by some of the testimony
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we'd heard downstairs and uh Ways
 
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
and Means from U various entities uh
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
which sets up some some uh pretty good
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
like guidelines representative Pierce
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
priest excuse me um I don't know about
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
you the community year over and over you
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
said I don't know how they do it over
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
there uh I don't know if you have your
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
own bylaws but I do know that there are
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
some communities that quite literally
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
make it up as they go
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
along thank you represent yella thank
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking the question
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
um as a zba board member um I am aware
 
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
that there is a vote that can be had um
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we they recommend
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
someone uh ref refrain from a perfect a
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
particular hearing but there is nothing
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is binding on that uh vote
 
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
that is binding on that uh vote
and

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
I am not sure if this um like whole of
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
page four um is meant to be binding
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
because it does not say that the board
 
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
member um shall then recuse himself or
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
may recuse himself or do anything it
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
just that the board other than that
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
member will take a vote um and so can
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
you expound on what your intention is
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
and how maybe that may be in Conflict if
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
it is with how zba is currently uh
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
work well U since this doesn't deal with
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
the zba it deals with the planning board
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
no but at the same time
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes I've been to to court too many times
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
um if you take a look at section
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
four the the members of the plan board
 
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
sh so it does apply to
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
them in one instance of which I am
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
familiar a member of the select
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
board while sitting as a member of the
 
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.229 align:start position:0%
board while sitting as a member of the
planning

01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
planning
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
board called a
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
so it's not limited to the the uh
 
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
members of the planning board you can't
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
have that if you're going to have an
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
unbiased decision so you have to
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
disassociate yourself if you will from
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
your personal opinions and evaluate each
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
plan separately based upon the facts in
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
front of you and that's what the intent
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill is is to set this down a
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
set of rules that applies now you want
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
to change one or two or three or four or
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
a paragraph perfectly fine but the idea
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
is to make sure the planning boards
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
boards in general you start with the
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
planning board and then it'll trickle
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
down to the other boards behave in a
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
fashion that doesn't denigrate
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
applicants it doesn't denigrate members
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
of the board it provides everyone with
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
an equal
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
access you know big phrases here equal
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
access and judgment under the law yeah
 
01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.629 align:start position:0%
access and judgment under the law yeah
but

01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative priest
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
question and thank you uh I have a
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
question regarding page four Section 8
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
abutters in any project or development
 
01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
being heard can request the accusal or
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
disqualification of a
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
specific uh board member uh to me I see
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
this as a delay tactic that um nimes can
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
um use to basically kill a project
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
because as we know time is money to
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
developers of projects and um no one
 
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
wants change in their communities and no
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
one wants uh anyone else to move in
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
there so can you talk about that further
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you sure glad to having been the
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
subject of
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
that you may recall that there was a uh
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
small project that was designed that was
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh offered Hudson couple of years ago uh
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
the abutters accused me of being biased
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
because I happen to be a member of Alec
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
it turns out that the developer he'll um
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
I forget the name of it Hills something
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
from the other construction company and
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
Amazon um were objectively not part of
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh Alec and that was the decision that
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
those particular corporations had made
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
when when they were offered to join
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
which is perfectly fine I mean it's
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
immaterial um the alleged bias that was
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
an attempt as the good representative
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out on in my belief uh to delay
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
the project
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
however a property and a butter to a
 
01:18:59.950 --> 01:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
property under development should have
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
every right to use
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
every available thing to get their point
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
of view across regarding it so you allow
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity denying them the
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity is a
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
mistake it's a mistake because it denies
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
them the chance to say what's going to
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
happen now in a particular development
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
turned out one of the property owners
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
decided to sell because he knew his
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
property value was going to go down and
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
he got almost
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
$300,000 more than the assessed value of
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
his house so that particular argument
 
01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
his house so that particular argument
disappeared

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
but that's neither here nor
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
there further
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question with regards to
 
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
that same section on page four Roman
 
01:19:54.199 --> 01:19:56.030 align:start position:0%
that same section on page four Roman
numeral

01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
7 is there do you have any concerns with
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
regards to rec recusal of board members
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
and then the inability of there might
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
not be enough um like substitutes to to
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
the planning board the the alternates
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
and then then what would
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
happen because some the meeting would
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
come to an end
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay until the next
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
meeting and and you could make sure that
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
you have uh but because you wouldn't
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
quorum your Quorum doesn't necessarily
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
if you got say seven permanent members
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
and three alternates you you know would
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
your Quorum is what five
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
so getting five out of 10 people is
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
be you know it you could happen but you
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
know meteorites could hit too all right
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to make light of it because
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
it it is a good point representing power
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it better
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have a single
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
representative are planning boards
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
currently considered in your opinion uh
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial administrative agency as
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
I indicated only by Best Practices
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
administered or suggested by the the
 
01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.310 align:start position:0%
administered or suggested by the the
municipal

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
Association um in my discussions with
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
them they suggested that this would be a
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
good idea to make sure that that is put
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
into law because that creates them into
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
a status that obligates a certain type
 
01:21:37.719 --> 01:21:38.590 align:start position:0%
a status that obligates a certain type
of

01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
behavior in dealing with the
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
public correct but they are even though
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
it's not I just I just want to make 100%
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
clear currently planning boards operate
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
as a quasi judicial administrative
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
agency under best practices not okay all
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
right thank you further
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%

sponsor I appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
introduce to you today House Bill
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
1187 for your consideration for the
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
record I am represent representative
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
Diane power I represent the towns of
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro County District
 
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
36 to begin Mr chair it's come to my
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
attention that across our state there is
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
widespread misuse of the statute
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
governing lease agreements of equipment
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
by some governing bodies under current
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
RSA school districts and towns are able
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
to place extremely high cost lease
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
agreements with 10 to even 20year ter
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
terms on the warrant needing and this
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
needs only a simple majority vote to be
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
approved if a
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
non-appropriation or Escape Clause is
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
included in the proposed lease agreement
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
moreover in school districts in towns
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
with a traditional town meeting a hand
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
card vote is all that is currently
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
required to pass such lease
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
agreements increasingly school districts
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
are using lease agreements with Escape
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
clauses clearly to avoid the 35ths
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
majority ballot vote when projects of
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
this ma magnitude and scope should
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
really be
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
bonded based on my own research to date
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
I have found 15 examples in counting of
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
school districts misusing lease
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment with Escape
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
Clauses for example in my own District
 
01:35:18.639 --> 01:35:19.510 align:start position:0%
Clauses for example in my own District
in

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
2022 the Brookline School District put
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
forth a warrant article for an 18-year
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
lease agreement totaling 2.5 million for
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
energy conservation equipment an
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
elevator security improvements and room
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
Renovations and just this year in 2024
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
the Thornton school district is putting
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
forth a 20year lease for a boiler room
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
replacement costing $4.4
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
million and the the most egregious
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
misuse of this lease statute that I
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
found was in
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
2023 where the Timberlane Regional
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
School District placed on the warrant an
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
article to fund a 20year lease agreement
 
01:36:07.239 --> 01:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
article to fund a 20year lease agreement
totaling

01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
totaling
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
$25.2 million for facilities repairs and
 
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance and unbelievably in their
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
voters guide it explained that their
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
real facility repair needs total over
 
01:36:23.159 --> 01:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
real facility repair needs total over
$116

01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
$116
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
million stop and think to yourself how
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
is a lease agreement with an escape
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
Clause practical in these applications
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
and how could you even escape a least
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
renovation of Greater concern is the
 
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
fact that school districts and towns are
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of a loophole in the
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
RSA by which they are appropriating
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to fund major
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
facilities improvements and Renovations
 
01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
around the lease of equipment Mr chair
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
this is a very serious problem that must
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
be addressed by the legislature which is
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
why I fit filed this bill in front of
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
you today the purpose of this bill is to
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
end the misuse of lease agreements of
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
equipment by changing the criteria and
 
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
the voting threshold for the legislative
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
body's approval of equipment leases over
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
$100,000 from a simple majority to a
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
35ths super majority ballot vote now I
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
will briefly explain how this bill
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
addresses the problem so I have passed
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
out an
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
amendment which is obviously an
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill as filed I started
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill in the summer I
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
worked on it a long time and ever since
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
it um it was referred to this committee
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
I I've continued to go over it and
 
01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
refine it and so the amendment in front
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
of you is is many edits because this is
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
an important bill and to be clear um
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
nhma has has looked at the the original
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
Bill language and so we've been talking
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
back and forth and I've put forward many
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
um refinements of this bill for their
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
you know feedback and at this point
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
right now for this bill hearing the
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that I pass passed out is is
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
the the version that I have right now I
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
am open to continuing to work with nhma
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
to further refine this as needed so I
 
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
will briefly talk about um the the the
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
highlights of of my Amendment so in
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
section one of the amended Bill
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
languages struck to close the loophole
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
that allows for building or facility
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
improvements related to the installation
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
of a piece of equipment to be deemed as
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
equipment which permits the cost of
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
those of the renovations to be financed
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
through a lease agreement that that's
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's significant that that's a huge um
 
01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
change and very important this loophole
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
allows for building materials like
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
framing drywall flooring doors windows
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
electrical lighting HVAC Etc to be quote
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
unquote leased again how can these fixed
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
and installed building materials be
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
returned under an escape
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
clause further in um the amended version

simple majority vote of the Le
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%

Lease agreements exceeding $100,000
 
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
with an escape Clause shall require a
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
35ths super majority ballot vote of the
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%

one hour in subsequent years a lease uh
 
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
a special warrant article um shall be
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
placed on or may be placed on the

warrant to raise in appropriate funds to
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
continue the lease agreement and
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
subsequent years it will um only require
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
a majority vote of the legislative body
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
to be approved alternatively
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for continuing the lease

line item in the approved operating
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
budget for this option no I I've
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
specified that no other purposes can be
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
co-mingled in with that uh individual
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
line item and importantly this
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
requirement provides a mechanism by
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
which the legislative body can non
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate the line item for the
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
lease and that is um that's allowed
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
under RSA 32 col 10 Roman numeral 1e the
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
lease agreement shall be terminated by
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
the governing body under the terms of
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
the Escape Clause if the special warrant
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
article to appropriate the funds to
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
continue the lease agreement is not
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislative body or if
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative body reduces the lease
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
budget line item to zero and if
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds for the lease agreement
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
are not available in a capital reserve
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
fund with the with the stated equipment
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
purpose Roman numeral 7 allows for lease
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
agreements to be funded through an
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
established capital reserve fund um as I
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
said with a um equipment purpose and
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
then next in section two of the
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
amendment um the bill adds lease
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
agreements to the definition of a
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
special warrant AR article um because
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
that they're multi-year expenditures and
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
finally in section three of the
 
01:42:29.709 --> 01:42:29.719 align:start position:0%
amendment the bill the amendment
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
requires towns or school districts that
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
have adopted the enabling statute
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
requiring that the estimated tax impact
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
be printed on the warrant that um
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
multi-year leases the tax impact shall
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
be printed um as well if if um that
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
enabling statute has been adopted so in
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
summary House Bill 1187 is much needed
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that requires a 35th super
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
majority ballot vote to approve the
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
lease agreements over
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and this is important since
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
lease agreements commit significant
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
spending over multiple years this bill
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
limits the term of a lease agreement to
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
no more than seven years and most
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
importantly this bill closes a loophole
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
that allowed build or facility
 
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
improvements and Renovations related to
 
01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:25.669 align:start position:0%
improvements and Renovations related to
the

01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
installation of equipment to be financed
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
through the lease agreement I
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you please
 
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
recommend recommend ought to pass as
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
1187 to bring an end to the misuse of
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
lease agreements of equipment thank you
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%

taking my question um I'm a little
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
perplexed about some of your
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um op operated Steam Plant for
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
the US Army for Fortune 500 companies
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
all your testimony was that a school
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
leased boiler
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
equipment that is correct thank you for
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
the question representative that is
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
correct quick followup what what school
 
01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.510 align:start position:0%
correct quick followup what what school
is

01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
that so um as I said I've identified 15
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
school districts that that are engaging
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
in this this um use misuse of
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
um this um lease lease agreement of
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
equipment so
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
I I have many pages here off the top of
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
my head I I don't recall which one least
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
boiler equipment
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
um I think in fact there are a couple
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%

today and the bill are we just supposed
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
to kind of focus on the amendment
 
01:45:20.189 --> 01:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't really relate to this
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
the as we have it thank you for the
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%

Kell thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
question um it seems that the
 
01:46:44.119 --> 01:46:46.310 align:start position:0%
question um it seems that the
$100,000

01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
um is not
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
as not the you know expansive amount
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
that um the ones that you're that you
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about the abuses of
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar contracts and stuff
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
like that so why did why did you focus
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
on the monetary issue and not just the
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
length of the and just stick with like
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know at least no more than seven
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
years and just stick with that instead
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
of having this additional layer of the
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
money issue also thank you rep
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for asking that
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
question so um I I did focus on the the
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
length of the term of the lease
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
agreement and and this bill um proposes
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
to cap that at seven like you identified
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I also address the
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
the the monetary number the
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
$100,000 is
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
because with in currently in statute
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
with with regard to lease agreements
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
there there that number
 
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.510 align:start position:0%
there there that number
$100,000

01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
um is specified if there is um no Escape
 
01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:02.679 align:start position:0%
Clause so just to be consistent so we
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
don't have different numbers jumbling
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
around in statute that's why I chose
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
that that particular number um I'd be
 
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.470 align:start position:0%
that that particular number um I'd be
open

01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
to changes represent K thank thank you
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking another
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
question on these uh these leases in in
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
your research and and searching this
 
01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
those contracts that are
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
clearly abuses um did they include like
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance contracts for those pieces
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
of equipment too like what was their
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
benefit for M there's no benefit for so
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
my thank you for the question
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative so my my research that
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to share with you it's it's in
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
a very rough form right here and maybe
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
not um
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
digestible and I did not have the time
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
to put it in in a nice format like I
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
would like to so what I did is I I
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
researched Warren articles and so I I
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
have I
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
have the reference where a warrant
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
article was was put on you know the
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
warrant in these different school
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
districts and so I've also um cut the
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
actual warrant article the wording that
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
went on the warrant I did
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
not do additional research to to delve
 
01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
into contracts and all all of that um
 
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
again I don't H have much success with
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
the research Department here so I needed
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
I had to do this all on my own um and
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
also I would like to state that um in my
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
um Bill introduction I did say that it
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
was the Timberland I mean the Thornton
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
School District was one example of um a
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
school district that used a lease
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
agreement with an escape clause for a
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
boil a boiler room replacement I I saw
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
that on their
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
warrant representative majori thank you
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my question it's
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's a two-part question if it's okay
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
with the chair but you'll tell me if
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
it's not uh and that's fine uh
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative I'm on page two between
 
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
lines 18 and 20 um it seems to me that
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
there's an expansion
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
in there of the intent of the original
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill which was for leases this includes
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
multi-year collective bargaining
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
agreements and so my question is why was
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
that added to the amendment but but also
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
to that you add in line the end of 19
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
and into 20 that the estimated tax
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
impact if it's a 7ye lease a town will
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
go through a reval in that period
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
because they'll have to do it every five
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
years do you have concern s that the tax
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
impact will not be accurate in year
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
potentially after even year one but
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
certainly after year five thank you okay
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the two questions um so to
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
answer the first one on page two of the
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
amendment as you noted I um yes I I
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
added in those other um items because
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
to answer the second question you had
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
said that asked if I was concerned that
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
the tax impact will not be accurate and
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
my response to that would be that the
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
voters need to have the information at
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
that point in time that snapshot and
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I do recognize that it's not going
 
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
to be written in stone things will
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
change however the bill requires that in
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
order for the lease agreement to
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
continue There Will Be subsequent
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
um warrant articles to to address that
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
and then in the subsequent years then
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
that information would be updated just
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's just to inform the voters of the
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
long range what they're getting
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
into thank you and I apologize for
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
having my head down normally I'd be
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
respond or listening but I just have to
 
01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.870 align:start position:0%
respond or listening but I just have to
take

01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.229 align:start position:0%
 
notes

01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
forther questions representative Gilman
 
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:26.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
taking my rep my question um currently
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh towns
 
01:52:37.069 --> 01:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
will purchase individual vehicles for
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
lease purchase uh for different
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
departments and it will come in their
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
tax or budget line for those different
 
01:52:50.109 --> 01:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
purposes do you would you consider that
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
one lease because it's for
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles so me understand you thank you
 
01:52:59.470 --> 01:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
for the question representative so
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
you're referring to my comments about
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
the um line item and not comingling
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
because often times towns municipalities
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
will will have a light line item for
 
01:53:18.189 --> 01:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
lease for leases in
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
collectively so the question question
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
was if we are doing lease purchases for
 
01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:28.149 align:start position:0%
was if we are doing lease purchases for
individual

01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles from and I will say from
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
different departments because that's
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
what we do um but would you consider
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
somebody could interpret uh that as
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
really one
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
least well that that would be under one
 
01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.189 align:start position:0%
least well that that would be under one
line

01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
item the question would be is it
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
possible to break to break those out
 
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
into sub line items therefore each one
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
could be um accessed individually I I
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
Las thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh fellow Committee Member
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
um in our town
 
01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:21.310 align:start position:0%
um in our town
we

01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
typically uh do lease purchase
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
agreements for for instance a fire truck
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
$700,000 so in that case would that
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
require a super
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
majority to approve that thank you
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative um it depends I didn't
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
catch if you said if there's an escape
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
Clause are not but yes um if this bill
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
were to to become law then because that
 
01:54:59.069 --> 01:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
is over $100,000 then then yes but I
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
would also like to note that you know
 
01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
something like a fire truck that that
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
can be returned I mean that's not a
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
fixed permanent installed item so
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
um that's that's not what this bill you
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
know con is concerned with it's the
 
01:55:19.950 --> 01:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
other um examples that that I cited
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman go ahead so in
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
that case the in the case of the fire
 
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
Tru the Escape
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
Clause would be
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
valid could you
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
explain what the Escape Clause how how
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
the law looks at an escape
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
Clause thank you for the question
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative so um if I understand
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
your your question my my response would
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
be an escape clause and a lease
 
01:55:58.030 --> 01:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
agreement enables or allows the the
 
01:56:01.709 --> 01:56:01.719 align:start position:0%
items to the lease agreement to be
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
returned further details um that you may
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
be looking for would would be found in a
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
particular lease agreement what the
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
terms are which it's different for every
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:56:26.069 --> 01:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
kill thank you for taking my question
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do you think it's
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
possible to return installed HVAC
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
equipment thank you for the question
 
01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative I I I it m it it makes no
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
sense it's impractical but yeah I guess
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
you could rip everything out you know
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
break down walls it's it doesn't make
 
01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
Holland thank you for taking my question
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
I hope this is makes sense how did you
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
pick a
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 thank you for the question
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative I believe that that
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
question was already asked of me and and
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
my my response was is that um the
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
current statute RSA 33 colon 7 that
 
01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
speaks to lease agreements of equipments
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
um that that's the whole statute that
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and that it does
 
01:57:24.199 --> 01:57:26.790 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and that it does
specify

01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
specify
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
um the the number $100,000 so instead of
 
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
picking some other random number and
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
potentially adding to confusion I just
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
consistent s
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
gallager um so regarding HVAC equipment
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
I mean we've got an A piece of HVAC
 
01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
equipment that um air purifier right
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
over there in the corner don't we would
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
that count or are
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative I don't to me that's
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's a piece of portable equipment
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's an air purifier I'm not sure
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
what's exactly behind you in the corner
 
01:58:11.199 --> 01:58:12.790 align:start position:0%
what's exactly behind you in the corner
there

01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
um clearly when I'm referring to HVAC
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
equipment I'm referring to f
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
installed you
 
01:58:26.109 --> 01:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
know equipment related to heating
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
ventilation air
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions um would it
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
make any
 
01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:43.660 align:start position:0%
make any
sense

01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:58:43.670 --> 01:58:45.830 align:start position:0%
sense
[Music]

01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
to spell
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
out like
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
your HVAC system
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
being I can't see a leas leasing company
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
doing this but evidently they have um so
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
that it's like limited to equipment that
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
can be returned if if it's not
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
funded uh is there some way
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
to kind of cut that out and spell it out
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative I I do believe that I
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
have addressed that very sufficiently
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
and if you look in the look to the the
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill as um filed on page one lines 8
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
through 11 there's those lines that are
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
struck out that in fact
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
is in my estimation a loophole that
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
refers back to effect of lease contract
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
and that's under um section 382 and it
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
specifically says in general that lease
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
of goods that are fixtures um or that
 
01:59:59.599 --> 02:00:01.069 align:start position:0%
of goods that are fixtures um or that
become

02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
fixtures of ordinary building materials
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
um you can't lease that but the problem
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
is is that in
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
this those lines are the loophole that
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
that allows that those types of things
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
to be leased so by striking that and
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
um on page one section three it makes it
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
very clear that um these things shall
 
02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
agreements forther questions represent
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
for taking another question um mine is a
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
followup to uh representative tet's uh
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
question about uh
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
equipment for in particular
 
02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:58.510 align:start position:0%
equipment for in particular
HVAC

02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
um you put you have put in here the
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
installation but there are uh an
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
operation but there are pieces of
 
02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
equipment say for example
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
um uh what is it for hbac the um through
 
02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
wall units that can be replaced if they
 
02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
fail um when you do
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember yeah split many
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
splits thank you very much and the
 
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
condenser unit that sits outside that's
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
not built in and can be replaced
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
separately from uh you know what's in
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
the ceilings in the walls um so I'm I
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if
 
02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.629 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if
this

02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
um dampens the ability of maintaining an
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
system thank you for the question
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't share your your
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
opinion and your analysis um with
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
regards to the problem that I'm trying
 
02:02:06.510 --> 02:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
to solve here I believe that you know
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
for the dollar amount of many splits
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
that might need to be replaced there's
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms to do that but that
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
being said um I I I continue to um and
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
will continue to work you know with nhma
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
to to to go over this
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
language um to refine it if necessary
 
02:02:30.069 --> 02:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
and I am open to any um feedback from
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
this committee so that I could
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into um whatever goes
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the exact session thank
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one
 
02:02:43.679 --> 02:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one
representative

02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment you passed out today um
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
as qu is quite a bit different than the
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
original Bill one of the things I note
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
is on the original Bill RSA 33 colon 8
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
was a major part of your bill and now
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
that is no longer part could you explain
 
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
why thank you for the question Mr chair
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
so um in speak I was approached by NH
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
with um regards to this this bill that's
 
02:03:21.069 --> 02:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
coming up for the Ing and um the
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
feedback that that I got was um not to
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
be mixing or placing um what I'm trying
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
to do here with regards to to to this
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill to solve the problem that I've
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
clearly laid out it it's not really the
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
best approach to be um putting it in 338
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
with regards to bonds and and notes the
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
the recommendation was to Simply keep
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
that in 33 colon 7 under lease
 
02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment which I I I
 
02:03:56.910 --> 02:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
agree and so that's why um
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore this the amended version
 
02:04:02.109 --> 02:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
It's a repeal and replace because to try
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill as filed it would
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
would have been very confusing so to
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
make things very simple um and like I
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
said I've streamlined this I've worked
 
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
very hard on this to to keep refining it
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment represents what it
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
is where it is today
 
02:04:23.069 --> 02:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
um that's the reason okay thank you
 
02:04:23.079 --> 02:04:24.069 align:start position:0%
um that's the reason okay thank you
further

02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
Katherine Heck from The New Hampshire
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association I serve as the
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
government Finance adviser for cities
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
and towns and in my capacity at nhma um
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
these are the types of things that we do
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
discuss often with cities and towns I
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
want to say that we have spoken with
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative power and we are always
 
02:05:14.669 --> 02:05:14.679 align:start position:0%
looking forward to amendments and
 
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
improving legislation that will
 
02:05:20.189 --> 02:05:20.199 align:start position:0%
basically have desired effect to solve
 
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand however I'm here today
 
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about the bill as written I
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
cannot speak on the amendment so with
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
that said I apologize in advance that
 
02:05:31.229 --> 02:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be able to speak on an
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
amendment I will only speak at the bill
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
as written and I'll just say that we do
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill as written because
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
there's there would be a significant
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
change to the current legal process
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
which is already defined in law for how
 
02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
equipment leases and it would further
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
create some technical issues um around
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
the procedure for authorizing um
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
long-term debt so there is already a
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
prescription in law for a capital lease
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
which is one that's defined as the
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership would occur at
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
some point in time under 30 RSA 338 for
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
anything over
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so we have two kinds of leases
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
we have Capital leases in which the
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
municipality or the political
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
subdivision or the school will take
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
ownership of that item and then we have
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
operating leases which the ownership St
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
days with the lessor meaning they will
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
always own it and they can take it back
 
02:06:25.149 --> 02:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
at any time so the law already
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
contemplates this however I do want to
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
agree that striking lines 9 through 11
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
on page one under RSA
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
337e would alleviate the 2014 Law
 
02:06:40.589 --> 02:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
changes that have created a great area
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the law that may be interpreted as
 
02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
allowing for things like Windows Doors
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
and roofs to somehow be leased we know
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
we cannot take them back equipment
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
already has a legal definition and it
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
already exists so equipment and
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
Machinery there is a distinction between
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
property that's fungible within the law
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
and permanent fixtures so we know a
 
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
window is a permanent fixture we're not
 
02:07:06.430 --> 02:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
debating that and again the law change
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
in 2014 has created some gray area so
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
well the issue the sponsor is trying to
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
solve there's nothing done illegally
 
02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
because under the current law a building
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
or facility Improvement related reled to
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
equipment is allowed in law so nothing
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
was done illegally however it might not
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
be the purpose for which this was this
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
section was put in so we would agree by
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
simply striking this section of Law and
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
not touching any other parts of the
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
lease the sponsor's objective of
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
ensuring that basically bondable
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
projects that have long-term and Lasting
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
character meaning a huge facility
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement would go through the regular
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
Bond on process as they should and have
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
that 2/3 or 3- fifths majority vote as
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
already required in law but we do really
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
want to talk a little bit about RSA 337e
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
because this is really around leasing of
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
equipment equipment machinery right
 
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
there are situations um in which a
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
municipality because we operate on a
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
year-to-year budget schedule right we
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
know at the end of the year our monies
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
lapse if they are unspent we only can
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
spend up to the amount that was approved
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
for those purposes by the legislative
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
body and at the end of that year we
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
start over we start over with a new
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
budget process so leasing of equipment
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
under the RSA contemplates that we
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
already operate on that year-to-year
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
basis we can either have a minicipal
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
Escape clause and that would typically
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
be for an operating lease one in which
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we would be giving it back or we
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
could be having a capital lease where we
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership but either way we
 
02:08:48.510 --> 02:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
already have to put that in front of of
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
the voters at some point in time and by
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
way of a warrant article and I've
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
provided some examples of the Dr
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
prescribed language um in either case
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
now if they're over $100,000 or more and
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
we know we want to keep that fir truck
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
it's an $800,000 fir Tru and we know we
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to keep it there's going to be no
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
Municipal Escape Clause we have no
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
intention of giving it back and that's
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
going to go through the bond process
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
right that's going to have to be
 
02:09:14.589 --> 02:09:14.599 align:start position:0%
elevated onto the warrant as one of the
 
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
first warrant articles has to have an
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
hour of time for the public to vote I
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
mean a very prescribed process now if
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're maybe a big city and that's why
 
02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:27.559 align:start position:0%
the $100,000 or the terms of s years or
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
any amount of years might be challenging
 
02:09:32.189 --> 02:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
is we have a greater and I know a
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
community has I is doing some research
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
entered into a
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
10-year operating lease to have a
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
greater because that type of equipment
 
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
can last much longer some communities
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
will have Capital leases for fire trucks
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
because they're smaller and want to keep
 
02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
it because they could probably use it
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
for 25 years a large city I don't know
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm not going to be an expert in
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
fire trucks or police cars but they have
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
a very different useful life depending
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
on their their use so by tying any type
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
of dollar amount to a lease it could be
 
02:10:04.589 --> 02:10:04.599 align:start position:0%
cumbersome however the law already
 
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
requires the legislative body to approve
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
these expenditures whether they're in
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
with an escape clause or without and I
 
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
think we have to look at a
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities um what the intent is so
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
I did provide an example in my testimony
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
about an a real life example of a town
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
that had a major it um a fraud occur
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
around its it and they were severely
 
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
compromised now their hardware and
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
software were over 10 years old so no
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
company could come in and make that um
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
make those fixes that were necessary
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
they did an RFP they needed to address
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
it immediately again they were
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
compromised there was fraudulent
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
activity so a company came in and said
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
we'll do a three-year lease on or
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
fiveyear lease whatever the case may be
 
02:10:54.549 --> 02:10:54.559 align:start position:0%
on it hardware and software upgrades now
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
gby Accounting Standards now allow us to
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
even lease software and why is that
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
because software gets better so even on
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
your Microsoft your personal Microsoft
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
remember you used to be able to buy it
 
02:11:07.709 --> 02:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
and own it and now they kind of let you
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
buy it one year at a time now because
 
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
they're changing it so often so what
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
would a select board do in this terrible
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
situation that is a real world situation
 
02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
they would enter into this lease they
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
would get hardware and software how long
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
do computers last not very long anymore
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
right they would get an escape Clause
 
02:11:26.910 --> 02:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
they would bring it before the
 
02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body in one of two ways
 
02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
either they would ask for year-over-year
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
funding or they would ask for the
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
contract to be bought out and at the end
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the three-year term they want to be
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
able to give back return all of those
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
computers and get new ones so they're
 
02:11:43.069 --> 02:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
never put in the situation again where
 
02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have up-to-date equipment and
 
02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
they would be highly compromised so
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
again the Dr Pur describes a language
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
that the number of years has to be
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
disclosed if there is a municipal Escape
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
Clause the amount the purpose and what's
 
02:11:59.549 --> 02:11:59.559 align:start position:0%
to be raised in taxes so we know that
 
02:12:01.950 --> 02:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of case law and addition
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
around lease and Lease agreements and
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
what is considered a fixture and all
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
that is included in my testimony but
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
again we know that real versus personal
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
property so based on the sponsors intent
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
in our conversations I I do believe by
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
striking the language in lines 9 through
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
11 and not going into any other areas of
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
the lease you can accomplish the goal of
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that windows and roofs and
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
doors go through the bonding process and
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
anything that is real equipment that can
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
be taken back or returned or in fact
 
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
leased for some number of years and the
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
the company will come in and keep
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
replacing it like a copy machine for
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
example right they'll take it back or
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
repair and replace it and it's their
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
problem could also be addressed so we
 
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
certainly want to be sensitive to what
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
may be happening and how the sponsor
 
02:12:51.629 --> 02:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
seeks to address it so I'm certainly
 
02:12:53.709 --> 02:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions I won't get
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
into all the the case law but I have
 
02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
cited it for you and we are looking
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
forward toward a resolution um that
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
everyone can feel comfortable with thank
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
you very much for the testimony do we
 
02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:08.430 align:start position:0%
you very much for the testimony do we
have

02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
Miss heck for taking my question so um I
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
spent some time on the capital
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
Improvement Committee in in my town and
 
02:13:24.669 --> 02:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
it it's kind of a fiveyear process that
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
we look at typically to determine what
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
these long-term leases might be um and
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
to address those but U from my
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
recollection I don't think there's any
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
legal requirement that those um items
 
02:13:42.189 --> 02:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
that are placed in the capital plans are
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
followed or that they look at any legal
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirement such as what's put forward
 
02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:50.599 align:start position:0%
in the in in this bill can you uh
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
clarify that I'm sure you're familiar
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
with that process thank you yeah so the
 
02:13:56.189 --> 02:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
capital impovement planning process is a
 
02:13:58.109 --> 02:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
planning board function um it works
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
along with the select boards that we
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
look at a six-year plan on what type of
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
equipment and facility needs we might
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
have in our future year so that we can
 
02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
because our budget covers one year but
 
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
we know that we'll have to replace a
 
02:14:14.189 --> 02:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
police car a fire truck a a dump truck
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
Windows Doors and roofs so that Capital
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
plan is certainly not contemplated in
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
this but the financial piece to your
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
Capital plan right but again that's all
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
voluntary would address that it would
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
address funding mechanisms and how you
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
plan to get from A to B to C to d right
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
so we know we need a police cruiser and
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
we need one every three years on a
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
replacement schedule we're going to
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
lease it we're going to give it back and
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
trade that one in every three years and
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
continue it on so that could be part of
 
02:14:47.709 --> 02:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
your financial plan for your Capital
 
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
plan plan however you could also have
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
capital capital leases in which you want
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
to own that fir Tru at the end of the
 
02:14:58.549 --> 02:14:58.559 align:start position:0%
term you want to pay for it for 10 years
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe in your community you can use
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
it for 20 because that piece of
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
equipment um isn't running constantly
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
and it it would
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
be useful it's useful life would in fact
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
be for 20 years so maybe you want to go
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
through the the bonding process given
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
its cost some I mean some of the fire
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
trucks are two and three million dollars
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
given its cost maybe you go through the
 
02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
bonding process for that and it's not a
 
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
lease process at all right so I think it
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
really depends um there's several
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
Financial strategies that a community
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
could take to address its capital plan
 
02:15:33.790 --> 02:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
and leasing is only one of
 
02:15:37.149 --> 02:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
several follow up Mr go ahead so in
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
regard to that Capital Improvement in
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
regard to that Capital Improvement plan
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
there is no legal requirement though to
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
follow that plan is that correct that is
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
correct it should be reviewed year
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
over-ear to determine it's right what
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
what the needs are in the community and
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
if anything is elevated in that plan um
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
meaning well I think we can get some
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
more time out of the police car but um
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
the dump truck is sitting on the side of
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
the road and it won't turn on anymore so
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
I there's
 
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely it should be reviewed every
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
single year and adjusted for the needs
 
02:16:10.750 --> 02:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
of the community thank
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
questions see on I have a couple quick
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
ones for you sure um you mentioned that
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
you were only speaking to the original
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
bill you have not seen the amendment yet
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
I I have seen I have seen but not enough
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
time because it really the amendment um
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
again and I will speak very just broadly
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
to it and the sponsors work very hard on
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment but it really gets into a
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
very P overprescribed way of leasing
 
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
because unfortunately there's not much
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
we can lease anymore for under $100,000
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
besides a a copy machine um so that
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
that's one piece of it it um and
 
02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
certainly the other piece would be that
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
many communities do put it on the
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
warrant year-over-year there is already
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the law already requires you to have
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
your line item detail budget to the
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
level in which you sub account so it
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
could be five accounts down available to
 
02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
the public so any lease in the budget
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
can already be removed out if it has an
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
escape Clause because again in year one
 
02:17:14.190 --> 02:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
you would say for the next five years we
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
are leasing the following and in year
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
two if the Community decides whether it
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
has a warrant article or not there's
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
still a mechanism already that any voter
 
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
could remove it out of the budget
 
02:17:26.669 --> 02:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
because it contains that escape Clause
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's already it's already within the the
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
purview of the law okay thank you and
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
the other question um going back to the
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
original B on lines 8 through 11 I think
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
you said it a couple times and I just
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you you didn't assign
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
a percentage to it but am I interpreting
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
what you've been saying that 99% of the
 
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
issues that the sponsor is attempting to
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of would be taken care of by
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
just striking that that's correct okay
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
02:18:00.589 --> 02:18:00.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
you hey I recognize this last name we
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
card Eric power you're
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
up school district governance
 
02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:18.429 align:start position:0%
up school district governance
Association

02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
you have the
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
floor thank you committee members my
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
name is Eric power from Brookline I'm
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
here in a couple
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
different capacities I'm the president
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
of the school district governance
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
Association who looks at
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
conservative uh spending and governance
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
issues with school districts um I also
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
serve uh on our Brookline planning board
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh they didn't send me I'm here
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
representing myself in that capacity um
 
02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
but a lot of these pieces cross over
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
between towns and school
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
districts and um first thing I'd like to
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
say is I think that you know you've
 
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
heard today about RSA
 
02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
337e while not doing things that are
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
illegal certainly stretching what the
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
intent of the law is by you know doing
 
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
lease agreements which are primarily
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
Renovations and throwing in a small
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of equipment to justify using
 
02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
this RSA you know you can't return
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
Windows 2x4 drywall but again you're
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
leasing it with an escape Clause it's a
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
little bit uh
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
disingenuous in my opinion
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
um in our Hollis Brookland Cooperative
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
School District where I was um I served
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
in the school board for three years so I
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
know you know how school boards work and
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
the budgeting and all that uh two years
 
02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
ago we leased for $2.9 million installed
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
HVAC and LED lighting with an escape
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
clause and uh for 15 years so obviously
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know it's not going to be easy to
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
return those sorts of things so
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
obviously that's another example of
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
what's been going on I think what's been
 
02:19:52.270 --> 02:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
the reason it's been this lease with
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
lease uh lease purchase with the Escape
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
Clause has been used is because it's
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
easier to pass at the town meeting or
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
the school district meeting it only
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
requires a simple majority vote um it
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't even require a ballot vote if
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
you have a traditional meeting um the
 
02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
example you heard about from T
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
Timberlane Regional School District that
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
passed by 55% so it didn't get the super
 
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
majority of 60% but the their TW their
 
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
20-year 24 plus million doll lease got
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
approved for essentially Renovations
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
with a couple of pieces of equipment in
 
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.870 align:start position:0%
with a couple of pieces of equipment in
there

02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
um I think the $100,000 number was
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
picked because it's aligns with what the
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
standard is for bonds today and um the
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
other thing that's a little bit
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
disappointing and every lease is a
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
little different but if you look at a
 
02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
majority of lease purchases that
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
typically cost cost taxpayers more money
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
not less because the interest rates on
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
bonds typically are more favorable so if
 
02:20:56.429 --> 02:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
you think about it you're reducing the
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
threshold from a super majority to a
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
simple majority and you're costing the
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers more money and they don't know
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
how much it's going to cost necessarily
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
so that's that's all u a problem that
 
02:21:09.309 --> 02:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
the that this bill seems to be
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
addressing which is good um voters
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
really need an option to not appropriate
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
um I heard that that's supposed to be
 
02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
the case but there's cases in which it's
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to find the least
 
02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment to zero it out that
 
02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
is not being followed and I think
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
putting this in this this statement in
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
the law would really make that clear if
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's really an opportunity to
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
non-appropriate it needs to be non
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
appropriable so it needs to be on its
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
own line item so that the voters could
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
zero it out if they would like to um I
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
think voters also need the full
 
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
transparency of tax the money that
 
02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
they're appropriating in future years
 
02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
and also the estimate of tax impact if
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
the voters have voted to have that
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
information realizing that taxes May the
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
tax rate may change but they're going to
 
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
get an update to that but in today's
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
dollars they would get that as they're
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
making a decision whether or not to vote
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
for that warant
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
article so um I would say if we if this
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill is passed by the legislature the
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
impact would be that this would stop the
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
renovations being done under lease
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements which is the big big
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
one is the big problem problem also I
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
think it is significant and you'll have
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
to discuss this is the 3- fifths super
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
majority a w a wise idea to deal with
 
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
equipment leases over
 
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um there I know being on the
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
planning board and doing Capital
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans every year as you
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
heard about I know there is a lot of
 
02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
equipment that costs a lot of money but
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
again you're spending 600 700 $800,000
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
for a fir Tru shouldn't the voters have
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of a say than a simple
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
majority on those kinds of large
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
purchases and commitments even if you
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
can escape you're still spending money
 
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
on it um I was looking at our town
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
budget and we've had some of these
 
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
challenges Our Town budget is up 50% in
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
the last five years this is not really
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
sustainable and a lot of that's being
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
driven by lease agreements so um having
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
having that super majority would help
 
02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
you know voters be able to say no to
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
things when they really truly can't
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
afford it so would ask you to consider
 
02:23:22.590 --> 02:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
that um I would so I would say the
 
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill again would be to
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
also for projects that are happening
 
02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
that are Renovations they will go
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
correctly through the bond process and
 
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
not through this least renovation
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
process so I see i' see there would be a
 
02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
return to the right mechanisms for for
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the rsas that are out there for
 
02:23:42.190 --> 02:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
these large projects for towns and
 
02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:43.429 align:start position:0%
these large projects for towns and
school

02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
districts and the just to add a footnote
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the Thorton uh boiler bill I do not
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
believe that's been approved but it's on
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
their warrant for this year in
 
02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
2024 and with that uh I'll answer any
 
02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for your
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
the question
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um it seemed from your testimony that
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
you may have um actually seen the
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
language of one of these leases
 
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
um for essentially installed equipment
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
that had an escape Clause um can
 
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit more if so um can
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit more on what
 
02:24:34.830 --> 02:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
exactly the Escape clause entailed and
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
what would be essentially returned if
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
anything so I did look at the one for
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
the least equipment in our Co-op School
 
02:24:46.990 --> 02:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
District uh basically to escape you have
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
have to return the equipment so if you
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
know anything about HVAC and I was a
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
civil engineer in the military for 30
 
02:24:57.070 --> 02:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
years so I know a thing or two you you
 
02:24:59.469 --> 02:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
can return it but it's going to be very
 
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
difficult and it's not going to be worth
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
as much money um you're going to spend
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
more money probably returning than it's
 
02:25:08.269 --> 02:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
worth LED lighting the same thing so
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's really not practical to do that but
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's what they say in there so it's
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a capricious uh
 
02:25:17.030 --> 02:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
non-appropriation Clause it's one no one
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
would do not that no one the voters
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even want to do it because it
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
would cost them more money so yes but
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
they have to put that in there to get it
 
02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
through this process of getting the
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
simple majority and leasing it and uh
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
having the card vote even I I think we
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
asked for a ballot vote in that
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
particular one because the voters can do
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
that at a traditional meeting but um it
 
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
didn't get a super majority I don't
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
believe thank
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions being none thank you very much
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
I have no more pink cards I have on the
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
blue sheet five individuals who signed
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.830 --> 02:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
favor and with that we will close the
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
1187 at that time we're doing good today
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
folks all right our next hearing starts
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
at 1 pm that'll be HB 1317 so we will
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.800 --> 03:33:25.150 align:start position:0%
 
then

03:33:25.150 --> 03:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
it is 1 o'clock we're going to get going
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
now open up the hearing on HB
 
03:33:33.150 --> 03:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
1317 relative to Municipal filings made
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
by Char organization exempt from
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
taxation I see the prime sponsor in
 
03:33:40.269 --> 03:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
front of US Representative Maguire the
 
03:33:42.510 --> 03:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
floor is your yours thank you very much
 
03:33:44.070 --> 03:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
03:33:46.030 --> 03:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Dan Maguire I
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Epsom before I get
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
started on this I would just wanted to
 
03:33:52.110 --> 03:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
mention I was in your sister Committee
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the Senate this morning for a public
 
03:33:56.830 --> 03:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and it struck me how none of the
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
five members of that committee are from
 
03:34:03.550 --> 03:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
any town of of ordinary size right there
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
there's like me right I'm from a town of
 
03:34:09.150 --> 03:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
under 5,000 people but but in that
 
03:34:11.229 --> 03:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
committee the the
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
smallest um Community they represent is
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth right so I don't know I guess
 
03:34:20.670 --> 03:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
it must be tough getting Town stuff
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
maybe through through that committee I
 
03:34:26.189 --> 03:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
don't know anyways back to this so um
 
03:34:29.070 --> 03:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1317 so um first of all I
 
03:34:32.070 --> 03:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
just handed out an amendment because you
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
had a previous bill from representative
 
03:34:38.110 --> 03:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
McDonald which dealt with the same thing
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
as section one of this bill the same RS
 
03:34:42.910 --> 03:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
say so this amendment just deletes
 
03:34:46.030 --> 03:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
section one right all right so we'll go
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
on to sections two and
 
03:34:50.429 --> 03:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
three um I put in this bill at the
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
request of Mr Haywood um from the
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
assessing group and um he's here to talk
 
03:34:58.590 --> 03:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
about it so I'm not going to say too
 
03:35:01.630 --> 03:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
much but basically this is in in a
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
couple of very sort of narrow cases this
 
03:35:07.150 --> 03:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
is to give Selectmen slightly more
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility over decisions that they
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
make um the first one in section two
 
03:35:16.630 --> 03:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
changes a shall into a May which sort of
 
03:35:20.469 --> 03:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
fits that sentence slightly better um it
 
03:35:25.150 --> 03:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
it it allows it it's asking um Charities
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
who want to who want some kind of an
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
exemption they have to provide
 
03:35:31.870 --> 03:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
information to the Selectmen
 
03:35:33.870 --> 03:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
organizational documents nature of
 
03:35:35.830 --> 03:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
membership function you know big list of
 
03:35:39.469 --> 03:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
things and and it says there basically
 
03:35:42.750 --> 03:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the full list of stuff
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
it shall result in a denial well maybe
 
03:35:48.030 --> 03:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
somebody can't find this or has a little
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
problem with that or something like that
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
so this lets the selectman make that
 
03:35:57.630 --> 03:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
decision and um the second part three is
 
03:36:01.309 --> 03:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
to um add the not limited to errors
 
03:36:03.630 --> 03:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
emissions and inability to pay to good
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
cause and so the idea there is um they
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
can again they can make their own
 
03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
decision out what's what's reasonable or
 
03:36:15.550 --> 03:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
what's not in in this situation when
 
03:36:18.030 --> 03:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're giving an abatement so I'm happy
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher go
 
03:36:30.309 --> 03:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
ahead um hi I'm Wonder or just looking
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
at this bill
 
03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
um the part about um well it's just
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
feeling awfully familiar and I'm
 
03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you looked into to the
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislative history of um past attempts
 
03:36:47.229 --> 03:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
03:36:47.239 --> 03:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
to do something
similar

03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:53.950 --> 03:36:53.960 align:start position:0%

the question representative um I believe
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
that Mr Haywood has a few examples of um
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
towns that he's worked at or been
 
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with that that have had you
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
know like Mason's groups and other
 
03:37:26.349 --> 03:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%

question um on page one of the bill um
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
line 20 um it references the term good
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
cause there's a legal definition for for
 
03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
that term and it depends upon the
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
context in which it's used could you
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
give me some specific um examples of
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
good cause as it pertains to this
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
section of our stat New Hampshire
 
03:39:39.680 --> 03:39:40.790 align:start position:0%
section of our stat New Hampshire
statute

03:39:40.790 --> 03:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:39:42.110 --> 03:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question

representative but again I will I will
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
defer to Mr Haywood I think he'll he's
 
03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
got examples and things that he's run
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
into in his work
 
03:39:56.189 --> 03:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
so representative lales go
 
03:39:58.590 --> 03:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my uh
 
03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:03.269 align:start position:0%
you for taking my uh
question

03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:40:07.389 --> 03:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
um does is there anything in statute
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
that you're a uh aware of that requires
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
for a charity to be involved in with the
 
03:40:22.150 --> 03:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill to file the
 
03:40:25.630 --> 03:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
necessary uh forms with the
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
state uh I know there are requirements
 
03:40:31.389 --> 03:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
for Charities to
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
file uh you know as far as their income
 
03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
and expenditures and so forth is there
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
anything in this that requires that
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
to give those to the town in order to
 
03:40:49.150 --> 03:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
qualify for
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if that makes sense to
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
you yeah I I think it does and um I
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
believe that essentially every
 
03:41:00.670 --> 03:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
corporation files with the secretary of
 
03:41:03.309 --> 03:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
state or every business right charitable
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
or not I think they file file with the
 
03:41:09.670 --> 03:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State periodically and so
 
03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:11.670 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State periodically and so
um

03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
so this if you if you read line let's
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
see this is existing law but uh line
 
03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:21.710 align:start position:0%
see this is existing law but uh line
15

03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
um if uh if a a town wanted to if if
 
03:41:29.790 --> 03:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
selectman wanted to ask for information
 
03:41:31.950 --> 03:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
like you're talking about they could
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
require it right because it says and
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
other such information as be reasonably
 
03:41:40.149 --> 03:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
required and so on okay you're right
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much all right
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher you had your
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
hand up yeah um so I'm wondering um
 
03:41:52.830 --> 03:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
about uh charitable gambling
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
specifically uh we had uh being from
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
conquered we had um a case with um a
 
03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:02.189 align:start position:0%
conquered we had um a case with um a
charitable

03:42:02.189 --> 03:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
03:42:05.790 --> 03:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
gambling um operation
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
um exploiting some loopholes and uh tax
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
law and I was wondering if that would um
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
this this legislation would have any
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
sort of effect on that sort of case um
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative I don't think so because
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
as I I only read about it in the
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
newspaper so but what I from what I read
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's strictly the problems there
 
03:42:36.910 --> 03:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
were between the state the the uh um
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission and the business and
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
and the AG and the business and this is
 
03:42:46.149 --> 03:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
all about Selectmen I
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:42:52.990 --> 03:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
for taking a second question and I'll go
 
03:42:58.389 --> 03:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
back to that line 20 with regards to um
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
good cause has a very broad definition
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to understand um the rash
 
03:43:07.750 --> 03:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
now behind the bolded um language that's
 
03:43:10.429 --> 03:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
added to the statute here
 
03:43:12.429 --> 03:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
not limited to errors omissions or
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
inability to
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
pay why did you feel that that needs to
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
be specified is is there an issue thank
 
03:43:21.149 --> 03:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
you for the question but I believe that
 
03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Haywood had an issue on on a
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
particular case where um
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
someone uh had a good ex reason for an
 
03:43:36.070 --> 03:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
abatement but it was not due to error
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
right it it or inability to pay it was
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
due to other cause
 
03:43:44.349 --> 03:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
believe are questions follow up go ahead
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for taking the
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
followup so my followup to to that is is
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
in line 21 it says that select Minar
 
03:43:57.389 --> 03:43:57.399 align:start position:0%
assesses May Abate
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
attack so they it's up to their
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
discretion so therefore in the case that
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
that um the particular case that you
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
referenced again it's up to the
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
discretion of of those people making the
 
03:44:14.590 --> 03:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
decision thank you for the question but
 
03:44:17.950 --> 03:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
again you're right they may if there's
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
good cause and if people think of good
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
cause as being errors emissions and
 
03:44:26.670 --> 03:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
ability to pay right and they'll say
 
03:44:28.269 --> 03:44:28.279 align:start position:0%
well you have a good cause but it's not
 
03:44:31.189 --> 03:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
one of these three things right then I'm
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
sorry you see what I mean so that that's
 
03:44:34.319 --> 03:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
sorry you see what I mean so that that's
the

03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
idea further questions comments
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
I think we've rung all the juice out
 
03:44:46.830 --> 03:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
of thank you okay thank you very much
 
03:44:48.910 --> 03:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative I have one other pink
 
03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:00.670 --> 03:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
Haywood thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:45:04.110 --> 03:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
the committee my name's Todd Haywood um
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
seems like it's been a week since I was
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
here last um as you as you may recall
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
but for anyone else that doesn't know
 
03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a member of the assessment
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
Community I've been an assessor for 24
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
years have an assessing consulting firm
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
that represents or advises 11 towns in
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um so this this uh kind of
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
result stems from um recent proceedings
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
which you may be familiar with or more
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
familiar with than you were a month ago
 
03:45:37.550 --> 03:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
and there was a town that um that
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
granted um EX exemption to an entity
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
that technically wouldn't
 
03:45:45.870 --> 03:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
qualify but they they're a charity so
 
03:45:48.269 --> 03:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
they answer the question about if a if a
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
501c3 charity qualifies that alone
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't qualify you to be property tax
 
03:45:57.309 --> 03:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
exempt there's a a statute that that has
 
03:46:00.590 --> 03:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
a four-part test you have to be um you
 
03:46:04.349 --> 03:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
have to own it occupy it use it for your
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
mission and your mission has to be
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
obligatory and benefit an indefinite
 
03:46:11.469 --> 03:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
segment of the population so those
 
03:46:13.149 --> 03:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
that's the four-part criteria I'm
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing the law so so just being
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
501c3 alone or a charitable trust member
 
03:46:22.510 --> 03:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
at the doj alone doesn't doesn't meet
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
the test so in section two this seeks to
 
03:46:33.389 --> 03:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 7223 C which allows the
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
assessors which are the Selectmen in
 
03:46:37.710 --> 03:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
most cases to request additional
 
03:46:40.269 --> 03:46:40.279 align:start position:0%
information from the
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
applicant but what it says now is if
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
they don't respond in 30 days they shall
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
be denied so you've recently been given
 
03:46:53.149 --> 03:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
a a partial order from the board of tax
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
and land appeals in in this case that I
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
am referring to where they ultimately
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
did an audit of the
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
town's practices for institutional
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions and in many cases it's the
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
Consultants don't deal with it that left
 
03:47:10.990 --> 03:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
up to the selectman because they've been
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with it for decades but since
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
this case it's become more to the
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
Forefront so what happened most recently
 
03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
there was there were four houses of
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
worship churches and one charity that
 
03:47:29.229 --> 03:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
had been receiving the exemption for
 
03:47:32.070 --> 03:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
decades but because of this case we
 
03:47:34.229 --> 03:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
asked them for their Articles of
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
Incorporation and their certificate of
 
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
good standing from the Secretary of
 
03:47:40.269 --> 03:47:40.279 align:start position:0%
State well as you can can imagine and I
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
think there was some commentary here
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
that the you know some of the people
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
that are in charge of these Charities
 
03:47:49.630 --> 03:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
aren't experts they're volunteers and
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
might be someone senior or in many cases
 
03:47:54.910 --> 03:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
as I've found out if there's a change in
 
03:47:56.910 --> 03:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
duties then the new person doesn't
 
03:47:58.750 --> 03:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
really understand the process quite as
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
they should so in any event these four
 
03:48:04.349 --> 03:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
churches didn't Supply their Articles of
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
Incorporation or U or certificate a good
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
standing within 30 days they did Supply
 
03:48:13.229 --> 03:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
it but because it wasn't within 30 days
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
they were ordered to issue a tax bill
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
for the full year of
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
2022 so we think if if we say may in 22
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh 7223 C on as it indicates on line 18
 
03:48:29.110 --> 03:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
of of this bill would allow the
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
Selectmen a little bit more flexibility
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they can use good judgment
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these type of instances
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
because what happened was is this which
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
this Segways into the next part section
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
three is B tax and land appeals said
 
03:48:47.469 --> 03:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
initially in these proceedings that you
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
can't use RSA
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
7616 Roman number one to circumvent RSA
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
7223 so that leads the Dilemma so so
 
03:49:02.670 --> 03:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
what we're asking is they say they say
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
or they said and they may have changed
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
their mind since then but they said in
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
January of
 
03:49:14.510 --> 03:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
2022 that um that you can't do that and
 
03:49:17.590 --> 03:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
then January 23 rolled around or
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
February 23 when these these entities
 
03:49:22.469 --> 03:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
were issued a tax bill for the whole
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
year 22 they filed for abatement
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
naturally and then so the legal opinion
 
03:49:29.189 --> 03:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
has changed and there's a differing
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
opinion the btla has said and it says in
 
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
their application that that that good
 
03:49:37.750 --> 03:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
cause is generally errors omissions and
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
in inability to pay
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's not what the law says and there's
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
a difference of opinion among legal the
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
town's attorneys and I and like I said I
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
work for several towns Town's attorneys
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
May differ and say that you can you can
 
03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
you have more discretion to answer a
 
03:49:56.110 --> 03:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
question I think I heard from this side
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
of the room there was a bill last year
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
that you may have heard that was
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
proposed to mirror what the btla suggest
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
is is good cause and it was going to
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
insert errors omissions an inability to
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
pay and that failed and you you probably
 
03:50:14.070 --> 03:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
remember that so this this kind of just
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
goes the other direction and allows that
 
03:50:20.269 --> 03:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the local
 
03:50:24.030 --> 03:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
assessors and I'd love to take any
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
any representative
 
03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
priest thank you for taking my question
 
03:50:32.149 --> 03:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here can you
 
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
tell us more about those communities
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
that and the teral institutions that uh
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:50:48.269 --> 03:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
resolve a remedy well I think we're
 
03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking to have more flexibility
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
the the you know the 7223 is broken up
 
03:50:59.469 --> 03:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
into six parts part part one and two is
 
03:51:01.990 --> 03:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
government and and University part three
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
is the houses of worship uh part five is
 
03:51:08.309 --> 03:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
the charitable and there's different
 
03:51:10.510 --> 03:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for each
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
um this the charitables it's a little
 
03:51:14.950 --> 03:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
bit more strict with them and I hope I'm
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
answering your question it's a little
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
more strict with them because if you're
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
religious we we know you're a church if
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
you're educational you're a school so
 
03:51:25.269 --> 03:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
those are easy to identify the
 
03:51:27.269 --> 03:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
charitables are a little bit more
 
03:51:27.279 --> 03:51:28.510 align:start position:0%
charitables are a little bit more
difficult

03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
because arguably is their mission
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
obligatory or not so that there could be
 
03:51:36.070 --> 03:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
many that fall into that but just
 
03:51:37.590 --> 03:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
because like as I said earlier just
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
because you're you're charitable 501c3
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the IRS doesn't alone qualify you
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
so there could be hundreds out there I I
 
03:51:47.910 --> 03:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure i' I've come across some
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
that I don't think should qualify that
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
have been granted exemption for a while
 
03:51:57.910 --> 03:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
clarify have
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for allowing me to uh
 
03:52:05.189 --> 03:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
give a followup it's it's my
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Attorney
 
03:52:12.070 --> 03:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
General's office that uh guides and
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
monitors the terriable
 
03:52:20.429 --> 03:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
institutions um requires them to get a
 
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
certification on a yearly
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
basis so there shouldn't be any
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
questions is that correct well there's
 
03:52:31.110 --> 03:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
I've reached out in the in my travels
 
03:52:33.550 --> 03:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years around this
 
03:52:35.910 --> 03:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
case I did reach out to the charitable
 
03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
trust division they told me that not all
 
03:52:39.950 --> 03:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
Charities do have to file the financial
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
form I think it's a nhct 12 is the
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
annual report and it's usually a
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure and and just
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
because you're like as I said just
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
because you're a charitable trust
 
03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't Al qualify you for property tax
 
03:52:58.510 --> 03:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
charity representative Gallagher um I
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I just uh want to thank you for
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
addressing the point about previous
 
03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
legislation um in your testimony um I
 
03:53:13.590 --> 03:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if you could uh find
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
the bill number for that um cuz I'd kind
 
03:53:21.030 --> 03:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
of like to review my review my nuts from
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
last time to um refresh my memory about
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
why it was specifically we rejected that
 
03:53:31.710 --> 03:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
I'd have to get it was HB 404 or 405 I
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
I'd have to double check on that one
 
03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay thanks represent power thank you Mr
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question but I can
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
answer I I have my own question but I
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
can answer that question it was 2023
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:53:46.990 --> 03:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
403 I think that's your reference thank
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
you so um thank you for taking my
 
03:53:51.790 --> 03:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
question it it's a clarifying question
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
so I did um establish that good cause
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
shown does have a broad definition and
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's relative to the context in
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
which it's used so I think that I'm
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
understanding my previous questions to
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor could you just confirm
 
03:54:07.710 --> 03:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is correct and
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
that the reason why this language not
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
limited to errors omissions or inability
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
to pay is is to make it clear that it's
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
not in this Con to text just those three
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
things it
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
it the purpose is to open it up and
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
allow for those plus other um good cause
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
reasons thank you for the question and
 
03:54:36.830 --> 03:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.950 --> 03:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:52.030 --> 03:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
um the the incidences that you U talked
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
about that precipitated the change from
 
03:54:56.429 --> 03:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
Sha to
 
03:55:00.670 --> 03:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
May um to be clear were those a result
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the individuals not or Charities not
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
getting the paperwork into you within 30
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
days correct the charity at the charity
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
was there part of the bill that that
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald uh authored
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
deals with um the Charities and their
 
03:55:20.950 --> 03:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
financial disclosures and given them
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
accident M mistake or Misfortune this is
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
similar because the the way the law is
 
03:55:28.149 --> 03:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
written now there's no discretion it's
 
03:55:31.710 --> 03:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
30 days or or you you shall be denied
 
03:55:31.720 --> 03:55:33.269 align:start position:0%
30 days or or you you shall be denied
correct

03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:55:37.389 --> 03:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
um and refresh my memory very quickly
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
what was the reason for they couldn't
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
get it to them in 30 days well there
 
03:55:43.469 --> 03:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
were various reasons but more more
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
specifically I suppose that sticks out
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
in my mind is is they were they whoever
 
03:55:49.630 --> 03:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
whoever was in charge of those documents
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
didn't know where they were and they
 
03:55:54.510 --> 03:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
were looking for them okay uh the next
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
part yeah um I think it's would maybe
 
03:55:58.550 --> 03:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
help to clarify for
 
03:55:58.560 --> 03:56:00.389 align:start position:0%
help to clarify for
everybody

03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
um the words not limited to errors
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
emissions or ability to pay what that
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
line does in my opinion is it
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
delineates and explicitly says that
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
errors emissions and ability to pay are
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
considered good cause yet it is not
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
limited to those three items it's
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what it
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
says my question to you on that line
 
03:56:27.359 --> 03:56:28.830 align:start position:0%
says my question to you on that line
there

03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
is explain to me inability to pay so
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's that would be an impoverished
 
03:56:35.040 --> 03:56:37.349 align:start position:0%
that's that would be an impoverished
person

03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
um they the the selectman could wave
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
taxes if if someone had no money if
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
there was they were on the most likely
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
in my experience if someone were on the
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
verge of of losing their property and
 
03:56:50.670 --> 03:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
being displaced they would for
 
03:56:52.990 --> 03:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
non-payment of taxes they would they
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
would use that as a reason for good
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
cause thank you uh representative
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you for taking my question
 
03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
chairman um regarding inability to pay
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
um and being impoverished and on the
 
03:57:16.030 --> 03:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
verge of losing their
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
status again if a
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
charity required to file say a 990 with
 
03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:26.910 align:start position:0%
charity required to file say a 990 with
the

03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
IRS um was on the A and had not done so
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
for three years and was put on the auto
 
03:57:34.080 --> 03:57:37.590 align:start position:0%
for three years and was put on the auto
revocation

03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
list why would they want to Abate the
 
03:57:46.030 --> 03:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
taxes I mean I I'm having a hard time
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
understanding so thank you for the
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
question my the way I perceive the
 
03:57:53.790 --> 03:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
inability to pay as an individual like
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
someone that a resident that lived there
 
03:57:59.670 --> 03:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
and not so much um not so much a charity
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
but I suppose you could you could take
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
that definition broadly and and apply it
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
in that case but if they were in if they
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
weren't current with their legal status
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
then that would PR preclude them from
 
03:58:14.670 --> 03:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
being a charity
 
03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
too followup Mr chair go ahead you said
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
someone might live there I I don't
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
understand so so the inability to pay
 
03:58:26.750 --> 03:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
would it that's a broad term we're
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
dealing with property taxes and most of
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
the property tax payers are are
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
individuals that live in their
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
properties and that would be the case
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
that I've seen that we would use that
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
inability to pay pay for Mrs Smith that
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
was behind in her taxes in Jeopardy of
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
losing her house because for non-payment
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
of taxes I'm sorry I misunderstood thank
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%

03:58:56.349 --> 03:58:56.359 align:start position:0%

03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
speak uh we have on the blue sheet one

individual who just testified Todd

you

04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh we are going to go ahead and
 
04:01:45.070 --> 04:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing now on HB 1459
 
04:01:47.309 --> 04:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
policies that
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
or yeah policies that municipalities are
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
preempted from
 
04:01:54.960 --> 04:01:57.469 align:start position:0%
preempted from
enacting

04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
enacting
 
04:02:02.910 --> 04:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
the only sponsor on the bill resigned
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
his um position last week because he
 
04:02:07.359 --> 04:02:08.750 align:start position:0%
his um position last week because he
moved

04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
moved
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
so we do not have a prime sponsor and
 
04:02:14.110 --> 04:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
typically in this committee is when we
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a prime sponsor we have
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
somebody introduce and unless somebody
 
04:02:20.510 --> 04:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
really really wants to speak to it we
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
will immediately close it and dispose of
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
it at a later
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
hearing so um I'll ask somebody one of
 
04:02:32.910 --> 04:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
us wants to go up there
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%

04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
detail when I'm when I'm
 
04:46:51.390 --> 04:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
done I sponsored this bill for two
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
reasons it's it's my view that land use
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
policy is it needs to be inherently it's
 
04:47:00.718 --> 04:47:02.430 align:start position:0%
policy is it needs to be inherently it's
inherently

04:47:02.430 --> 04:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
inherently
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
local uh I also think it should be
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
stable with changes in this policy uh as
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
is generally the case now made only with
 
04:47:11.638 --> 04:47:12.948 align:start position:0%
is generally the case now made only with
local

04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
approval now I say land use issues are
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
inherently local because the local
 
04:47:22.110 --> 04:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
residents of an area are the most
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
directly by land use policies and have
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with the consequences of those
 
04:47:27.760 --> 04:47:29.910 align:start position:0%
to deal with the consequences of those
policies

04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
policies
 
04:47:34.350 --> 04:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
directly also the local residents are
 
04:47:35.708 --> 04:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
the most familiar with the local
 
04:47:38.350 --> 04:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
environment that in impacts land use
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
decisions and also the conditions under
 
04:47:42.430 --> 04:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
which they live now I'll give you an
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
example of that kind of familiarity I
 
04:47:47.470 --> 04:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
come from ringe ringe is on the Divide
 
04:47:50.548 --> 04:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
between the Connecticut and the marac
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
watersheds those of us who live in Ren
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
are well aware that all the water we
 
04:47:56.350 --> 04:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
consume or
 
04:47:58.750 --> 04:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
use uh derives from rainfall because
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
there aren't any uh there's no flowing
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
water there's no streams or rivers that
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
flow into
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
wrench and so we always have to be
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
concerned when discussing or reviewing
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
potential developments in the town
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
where's the water going to come from so
 
04:48:16.830 --> 04:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's an example of the importance of
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
local familiarity with environmental
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
conditions uh so to my view the best
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
policy decisions uh regarding land use
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
are made by those who have a good
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of local factors are directly
 
04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
accountable to the voters the local
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
inhabitants and also share the
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
consequences uh in New Hampshire we have
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
a long tradition of local elected land
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
use boards in in ringe for example we
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
have planning and zoning boards which
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
are accountable to accountable to the
 
04:48:49.480 --> 04:48:50.750 align:start position:0%
are accountable to accountable to the
local

04:48:50.750 --> 04:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
voters uh in in ringe I I I looked at a
 
04:48:58.548 --> 04:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
number of the uh older annual reports
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
the furthest back I could find a
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
reference to zoning uh zoning commission
 
04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
and zoning ordinances en ringed was 1954
 
04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
70 years ago uh classical three score in
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
10 years almost you know
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:22.030 --> 04:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
days uh and one of the one of the early
 
04:49:24.270 --> 04:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
lessons I learned as a selectman was
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
that when somebody was
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
unhappy with a planning board or Zoning
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment decision typically
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
people would come to a selectman and it
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
was important to explain to them that
 
04:49:38.910 --> 04:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
the people making this decision weren't
 
04:49:40.350 --> 04:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
the select board but they were their
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
locally elected planning board and
 
04:49:46.990 --> 04:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board and it didn't make him
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
happier with the decision but at least
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
they understood that they could in the
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
long run
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
influence uh the people making the
 
04:49:56.590 --> 04:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
votes uh the reason I think
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
that uh zoning uh decision
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
General land use
 
04:50:10.350 --> 04:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
decisions need to be stable is that for
 
04:50:13.830 --> 04:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
most of us most people their single most
 
04:50:16.470 --> 04:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
important uh decision in their Liv
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
financial decision is buying a home it's
 
04:50:23.948 --> 04:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
the single most expensive investment
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
most of us make and it's also an
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
investment that directly impacts the
 
04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
quality of our
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
life uh based on our local
 
04:50:35.070 --> 04:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
environment so I think people should be
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
able to expect stability with land use
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh policies changed only with local
 
04:50:46.990 --> 04:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
Ru now I think that policy which as I
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
said has long standing in New Hampshire
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
of local control needs to be restored a
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
bit because of the
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
recent uh introduction of the housing
 
04:50:56.040 --> 04:50:57.190 align:start position:0%
recent uh introduction of the housing
appeals

04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
appeals
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
board which instead
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
of uh the decision path going from uh
 
04:51:08.110 --> 04:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
planning board to zoning Board of
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment if necessary or to a judge in
 
04:51:13.750 --> 04:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
this Superior Court there's now this
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board which as near as I
 
04:51:16.040 --> 04:51:17.070 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board which as near as I
can

04:51:17.070 --> 04:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
tell uh is not accable to voters in any
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
way since they're all
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
appointed and since they're not local
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have to share any of the
 
04:51:27.788 --> 04:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
consequences of the decisions they make
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh not a good
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:35.590 align:start position:0%
that's uh not a good
development

04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
development
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
so uh that's my statement and
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
introduction I going to defer questions
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
to the author of the bill uh former
 
04:51:43.080 --> 04:51:44.310 align:start position:0%
to the author of the bill uh former
representative

04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
McConnell and I will stay a little bit
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
but I need to get back to the election
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
law committee meeting I'm in well thank
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time and thank
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak to this
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for your
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
testimony okay we will call up uh
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
honorable Jim
 
04:52:02.638 --> 04:52:09.788 align:start position:0%
honorable Jim
oon

04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
McConnell thank Mr chairman members of
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
the committee I wondered why I hadn't
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
heard it in any event it's been a
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
while um you have testimony in front of
 
04:52:32.788 --> 04:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
you which some of you have already read
 
04:52:34.430 --> 04:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
but basically I can quickly go through
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
this cacr gives municipalities sole
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
authority to establish zoning and land
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
use policies briefly the amendment
 
04:52:43.548 --> 04:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
provides that municipalities determine
 
04:52:45.150 --> 04:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
the policies for projects they're
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
willing to consider should a developer
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
seek a waiver to those policies the
 
04:52:51.230 --> 04:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
voters consider the waiver at the next
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
municipal election it's been suggested
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
that municipalities already have the
 
04:52:57.070 --> 04:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
authority they need but legislation's
 
04:52:58.708 --> 04:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
frequently offered which suggests
 
04:53:00.868 --> 04:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
otherwise this morning for example SB
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
538 L which is sponsored by 10 state
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
senators Was Heard by the Senate's

election law and Municipal Affairs
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee a portion of the Bill's
 
04:53:11.670 --> 04:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
analysis reads enables municipalities to
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
allow its governing body to adopt
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
certain zoning ordinance changes and
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
adds additional Authority and Zoning
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
powers for parking requirements and
 
04:53:21.430 --> 04:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
lotsize requirements related to sewer
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure once
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
cacr 16 is adopted the state's 234
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities are free to establish
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
policies designed to be either welcoming
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
unwelcoming or anything in between to
 
04:53:35.830 --> 04:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
devel developers this flexibility is
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by S SP 53 538 L's
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
significant departure from current state
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
imposed requirements the most welcoming
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
policies can be designed to ensure that
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
waivers are rarely required should a
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
developer seek a waiver from
 
04:53:53.548 --> 04:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities policies CA cacr 16
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
stipulates requirements which ensure
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
local control importantly including a
 
04:54:00.030 --> 04:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
financial impact statement listing any
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
projected tax
 
04:54:04.350 --> 04:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
increases statements
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
um which voters may consider in voting
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
to approve or disapprove the requested
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
waiver adoption of CAC R16 makes
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
development easier to attract in those
 
04:54:15.150 --> 04:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities seeking development and
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
at the same time protects those
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
communities which wish to retain their
 
04:54:21.310 --> 04:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
current character I'm the author of cic
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
R16 I'll be happy to answer your
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh the text following this is
 
04:54:29.110 --> 04:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh basically an oped that I wrote in the
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor back in August and or
 
04:54:33.548 --> 04:54:33.558 align:start position:0%
yeah the conquered monitor back in
 
04:54:35.470 --> 04:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
August and essentially explains my
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
thinking on all of this so I will be
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay represent
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so the the prime
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this legislation um made
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
mention of um he's from a small town out
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the western part of the state and um
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
their community that they're concerned
 
04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
about the supply and the quality of
 
04:55:05.868 --> 04:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
their water so and that's one of the
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why he said that you know this
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
bill in this bill the purpose is is for
 
04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
land use to be local because people
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
local understand the needs so my
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
question is is with regards to any type
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
of development is not Dees involved um
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
with regards to um permitting
 
04:55:35.110 --> 04:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
or the the the the um the water use
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
because a lot of our municipalities um
 
04:55:42.030 --> 04:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
are not on public water and SE or they
 
04:55:44.030 --> 04:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
have their own private Wells so my
 
04:55:44.040 --> 04:55:46.310 align:start position:0%
have their own private Wells so my
question

04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
is I'm trying to under because that was
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
a concern and I think a rationale for
 
04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
what why this legislation is important
 
04:55:55.548 --> 04:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
but I'm just wondering is there already
 
04:55:58.510 --> 04:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
a check and a balance not that I'm aware
 
04:56:00.548 --> 04:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
of in that respect because and I served
 
04:56:01.948 --> 04:56:01.958 align:start position:0%
for four years on the resource
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
Recreation development committee and was
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
deeply involved with Dees but I'm not
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact and I could be wrong
 
04:56:08.708 --> 04:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
on this but I'm not aware of any
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
requirement that Dees sign off on any
 
04:56:11.798 --> 04:56:15.470 align:start position:0%
requirement that Dees sign off on any
particular

04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
project representative
 
04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'll say
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
many because I don't know that it's all
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
communities uh have Master plans and I'm
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
curious how this parallels Strays from
 
04:56:36.190 --> 04:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
collides with or whatever your your
 
04:56:38.750 --> 04:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation might be with a
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
community's efforts to put this kind of
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
information into a master
 
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
plan well yes I guess most of them do
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
have Master plans there are 234
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
different commun municipalities in the
 
04:56:53.830 --> 04:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
state and obviously this would provide
 
04:56:56.190 --> 04:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for any municipality to
 
04:56:56.200 --> 04:56:57.310 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for any municipality to
revise

04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
revise
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
its master plan and the guidance that it
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
wants to offer anybody who is coming in
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
as a developer as to what they're
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to consider and that being the
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
case this gives them an opportunity to
 
04:57:12.190 --> 04:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
redo that with this in mind now it seems
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
to me that a development that a
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
community should they wish to be
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
welcoming to developers can basically
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
fix it so waivers would almost never be
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
required they can make it extremely
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
Broad and make it very easy for a
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
developer to come in and do almost
 
04:57:31.548 --> 04:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
anything he chooses to do within those
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
guidance within that guidance
 
04:57:36.590 --> 04:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
the uh by the same token the other side
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
of that blade because it cuts both ways
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
is that if you choose not if you were a
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
rural community and choose not to have
 
04:57:46.270 --> 04:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
much development you can say okay we're
 
04:57:47.868 --> 04:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
going to make it difficult for developer
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
because we are sufficiently dense and
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
like ringe we have a water problem we
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
want to be very careful about what we
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
bring in here the bottom line is that's
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
under our control and we can make it
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
very hard for developer as well so you
 
04:58:01.110 --> 04:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
can make it very easy or very difficult
 
04:58:03.310 --> 04:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
and to my way of thinking everybody
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
should be supporting this and should be
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
bipartisan a town like Manchester or
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
NASA and I've written to both of their
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
Mayors so I don't know if they've said
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
anything to you but they haven't said
 
04:58:13.628 --> 04:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
much to me but the bottom line is they
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
have flexibility here which witness
 
04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 538 they don't have now and
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
if this passes they're going to be able
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
to make it very welcoming to developers
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that the state has a
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
housing crunch as does most of the
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
country and we're not the most extreme
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
example by a long shot from what I can
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
see uh they'd be in a position to make
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
themselves very welcoming and proceed
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.628 --> 04:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
Pace representative
 
04:58:47.230 --> 04:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
El thank you Mr chairman and welcome
 
04:58:47.240 --> 04:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
El thank you Mr chairman and welcome
thank

04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:58:48.240 --> 04:58:49.750 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
huh um so there seems to be opposition
 
04:58:56.350 --> 04:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
to the housing housing appeals board
 
04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
appeals board which after a zoning board
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
decision um an applicant K turn a butter
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
May appeal to either the superior court
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
or to the housing appeals board
 
04:59:12.510 --> 04:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know if the housing
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
appeals board has an option where you
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
can go to the superior court but even if
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
it does the bottom line is the housing
 
04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
appeals board rules with the developers
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
something like 98% of the time I'm
 
04:59:26.430 --> 04:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
told you're told by who sir by reading
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
you represent Gilman
 
04:59:35.948 --> 04:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I will tell you I
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
have several questions but I'll ask one
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
and then uh maybe somebody else will
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
follow up um one of the questions that I
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
had thank you for for uh taking my
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
testim giving your testimony is um on
 
04:59:53.708 --> 04:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
line six where it says project seeking
 
04:59:56.110 --> 04:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
changes variances or
 
04:59:56.120 --> 04:59:59.670 align:start position:0%
changes variances or
waivers

04:59:59.670 --> 04:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.680 --> 05:00:01.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
well will this lead
 
05:00:09.070 --> 05:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
to uh going if all is going before the
 
05:00:09.080 --> 05:00:11.670 align:start position:0%
to uh going if all is going before the
um

05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
local legislative body um what do you
 
05:00:19.470 --> 05:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
see as far as Town meetings that decide
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
this are we going to have make the uh
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
applicant wait a year or um have several
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
special meetings for a project no the uh
 
05:00:34.910 --> 05:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be a one-time opportunity for
 
05:00:37.230 --> 05:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
citizens to vote at the municipal
 
05:00:40.948 --> 05:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
election for any waivers requested so
 
05:00:43.150 --> 05:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
should a developer come to the community
 
05:00:44.910 --> 05:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
in June and
 
05:00:47.670 --> 05:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
say I love your project I love the
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
project as currently written I've got
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
plans that can do this in a heartbeat
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
but I really can't live with two stories
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
I've got to have four well obviously
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
that presents some problems potential
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
problems in any event he seeks a waiver
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
so if he does proceed to seek that
 
05:01:08.190 --> 05:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
waiver he'd have to presumably pay the
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
municipality for the preparation of the
 
05:01:13.230 --> 05:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
financial impact statement he'd have to
 
05:01:15.390 --> 05:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
provide them with all of his details and
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
all of that in and and be willing to
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions as they go along
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
but that information would have to be
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
prepared 45 days prior to the next
 
05:01:26.430 --> 05:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
municipal election so if he comes in
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
June seeking a waiver he won't get it
 
05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
until that March election but the bottom
 
05:01:33.708 --> 05:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
line is that if the community is
 
05:01:35.708 --> 05:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
sufficiently welcoming and is anxious to
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
have that project they could have
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
written that into the uh plans in
 
05:01:42.750 --> 05:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
advance now something like that with an
 
05:01:45.390 --> 05:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
increase for example of two stories to
 
05:01:47.310 --> 05:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
four there are all kinds of problems
 
05:01:48.910 --> 05:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
with that potentially I mean the fire
 
05:01:50.230 --> 05:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
department takes a look at it and says
 
05:01:52.350 --> 05:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have a hook and ladder
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
trailer okay we're going to have to have
 
05:01:55.548 --> 05:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
a garage for that hook and ladder
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
trailer if we get it if in fact we need
 
05:02:00.590 --> 05:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
to we put in a four-story building we
 
05:02:03.788 --> 05:02:03.798 align:start position:0%
may need a bigger water pump pumping
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
machine uh truck I'm not a fireman so I
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't really know but the point is that
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
all of those things would have to be
 
05:02:12.990 --> 05:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
taken into account and you know the
 
05:02:14.350 --> 05:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
police department comes along and says
 
05:02:15.628 --> 05:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
well you're going to double the capacity
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
of that building that line that road
 
05:02:19.708 --> 05:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
that runs to the main road can't have a
 
05:02:21.190 --> 05:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
stop sign anymore it's now got to have a
 
05:02:22.990 --> 05:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
regular traffic light there's going to
 
05:02:25.230 --> 05:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
be all kinds of additional costs that
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
are involved in this and those should
 
05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
everybody should see those eyes open now
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
offsetting that of course is the fact
 
05:02:32.788 --> 05:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
that the project is now twice as large
 
05:02:34.270 --> 05:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
large as it was so it'll have more
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming in from taxes but is that
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient to offset that nobody
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
knows but that's that's how this would
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
F uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
your presentation former
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative um my question I think is
 
05:02:57.360 --> 05:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
representative um my question I think is
a

05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:02:58.400 --> 05:03:00.310 align:start position:0%
a
followup

05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you you talk about
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
um waivers and zoning ordinances or
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
changes to land use
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
regulations may not be considered
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
without the approval of all Civic
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
veterans fraternal not for-profit
 
05:03:21.270 --> 05:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
Association Property Owners
 
05:03:21.280 --> 05:03:23.030 align:start position:0%
Association Property Owners
affected

05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
affected
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
um by that statement in the uh in the
 
05:03:30.750 --> 05:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
document do
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
you do you mean that that a planning
 
05:03:38.590 --> 05:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
board cannot even take up the issue
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
without the approval of all of those
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
groups I'm saying that any one of those
 
05:03:45.548 --> 05:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
groups could stop the project at any
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
point should they determine that they
 
05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
have been influ been affected for
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
example the ladies Garden Club even
 
05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
though it may not be in a butter they
 
05:03:54.670 --> 05:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
take a look at the project as it's
 
05:03:57.548 --> 05:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
presented and determine that their
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
Gardens are going to be their growing
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
gardens are going to be in Shadow for
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
half of every day of the growing season
 
05:04:05.470 --> 05:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
are clearly affected the developer
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
should have to make his accommodation
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
with the ladies Garden Club as opposed
 
05:04:11.070 --> 05:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
to vice versa he can't just say well
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
ladies tough luck and that to some
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
degree is how it goes right now the
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
other thing is recognize the portion
 
05:04:20.030 --> 05:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
that says as affected I don't see this
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
coming up all that often if you're a
 
05:04:23.788 --> 05:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
Veterans of Foreign Wars and you're 10
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
miles down the road on the other side of
 
05:04:26.590 --> 05:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
a mountain and you want to claim that
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're effective I think that's a
 
05:04:29.788 --> 05:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
stretch and I don't think that's going
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
to hold up at all I think everybody
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.920 --> 05:04:35.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:39.470 --> 05:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead uh don't these groups
 
05:04:45.070 --> 05:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to um weigh in at a
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
planning board hearing or a zba hearing
 
05:04:50.350 --> 05:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
for example they probably do but if
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
they're it may not become apparent
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
immediately that that's the problem
 
05:04:56.990 --> 05:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
either way they're going to have to sign
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
off on it and if somebody figures out
 
05:05:00.990 --> 05:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
something like for example the ladies
 
05:05:02.670 --> 05:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
Garden Club determines that their Gard
 
05:05:03.910 --> 05:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
are going to be in Shadow half of the
 
05:05:06.670 --> 05:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
growing season that's a problem that may
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
not become immediately apparent but the
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
point is they are in a position where
 
05:05:12.350 --> 05:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
they will have to require the developer
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
to accommodate their wishes as opposed
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
their concerns as opposed to Simply
 
05:05:19.708 --> 05:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
lumping it now as I say I don't think
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to come up all that often
 
05:05:22.110 --> 05:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
because you generally have to be
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
affected and I think those things will
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
be apparent fairly quickly in most
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
cases represent
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
gager uh so the previous testifier the
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor testified that it was his
 
05:05:41.788 --> 05:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
opinion that um land use policy should
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
generally remain stable um is that your
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
stance as
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
well generally it is yes but if your if
 
05:05:52.590 --> 05:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
your if your community determines that
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
it has to be changed then they should be
 
05:05:55.788 --> 05:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
in a position to change that if they
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
find that they're getting way too much
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
development in the way of applications
 
05:06:01.628 --> 05:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
or way too few then they may want to
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
change it
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so followup um so if um so yeah I'm
 
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
basically just responding to the part
 
05:06:15.070 --> 05:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
where you said yes um so if when use
 
05:06:19.150 --> 05:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
policy should in fact remain stable then
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
um how is it supposed to react to
 
05:06:25.868 --> 05:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
dynamically changing situations such as
 
05:06:28.670 --> 05:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
the current housing
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
crisis well the community involved would
 
05:06:32.590 --> 05:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
have to determine as to whether not not
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis affects them directly
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
I mean if you live in a you know I've
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
got four pages or three pages or
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
something here about zoning and the US
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions that that affect
 
05:06:46.830 --> 05:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
it uh the local community should be
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
making those decisions themselves if
 
05:06:51.070 --> 05:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
they once make a decision they should
 
05:06:53.070 --> 05:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
obviously see how that results most of
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
them I would anticipate would make their
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
decisions and they would remain with
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
those decisions for some
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
time whether they want development or
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether they don't
 
05:07:04.080 --> 05:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
whether they don't
representative

05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
and for this very thoughtful bill so let
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
me just
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
recap uh with the situation so a
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
developer comes to your local town and
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
he wants to build this development but
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
this town but the project is not
 
05:07:28.590 --> 05:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
compliant with the master plan or the
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
zoning and the town does not have the
 
05:07:31.840 --> 05:07:33.628 align:start position:0%
zoning and the town does not have the
adequate

05:07:33.628 --> 05:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:07:38.590 --> 05:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to serve it so they deny
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
the project and the project appeals to
 
05:07:45.788 --> 05:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
the zoning board and the zoning board
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
denies it now they can go to the housing
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
appeals board to present their case and
 
05:07:57.150 --> 05:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board can approve it
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
putting the town in a very awkward
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:07.708 --> 05:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
and this is what your bill is trying to
 
05:08:09.548 --> 05:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
to add I think it's a correct assumption
 
05:08:10.830 --> 05:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
I mean you've gone through a couple of
 
05:08:14.350 --> 05:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
steps there but bottom line is this bill
 
05:08:16.030 --> 05:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
cuts through all the rest of it and
 
05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
basically says this Constitutional
 
05:08:20.190 --> 05:08:20.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment those things in the law which
 
05:08:21.948 --> 05:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
currently conflict with this new con
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
with this Constitutional Amendment right
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
are wiped off so that so the housing
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
appeals board would if
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
this um yes yes is approved this seizes
 
05:08:38.190 --> 05:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
and they say the state does not have any
 
05:08:40.830 --> 05:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
say in the local what happens in the
 
05:08:44.190 --> 05:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
local governments right in yes
 
05:08:46.110 --> 05:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay great that's the purpose
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:51.360 --> 05:08:53.350 align:start position:0%
 
much

05:08:53.350 --> 05:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr
 
05:09:00.190 --> 05:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um on line six and
 
05:09:05.230 --> 05:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
seven it says project seeking changes or
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
variances uh to the zoning ordinance or
 
05:09:09.990 --> 05:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
land use
 
05:09:12.548 --> 05:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
regulations may not be considered or
 
05:09:15.548 --> 05:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
approved without prior approval
 
05:09:18.990 --> 05:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
Etc does this now the zba is EMP
 
05:09:22.590 --> 05:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
currently empowered to Grant variances
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
and special exceptions so would this
 
05:09:30.910 --> 05:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
strip the zba of that power to Grant a
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
variance yes
 
05:09:34.990 --> 05:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean the bottom line is that
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
the only variances that would be
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
permitted were this to be adopted would
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
be those at the municipal
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
election that's local
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
control represent Gilman thank you Mr
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking another
 
05:09:54.190 --> 05:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
question um I'm going to follow up on
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
um one is
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
um on that same line about
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
um variances and waivers and listening
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
to um the Civic veterans and fraternal
 
05:10:12.548 --> 05:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
organizations why does it not include a
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
Butters why does it not include a
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
Butters yes prior approval of a Butters
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why a municipality
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't add a
 
05:10:28.270 --> 05:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
requirement okay follow up Mr chair
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely go ahead um it's been my
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
experience here for almost 8 years that
 
05:10:40.110 --> 05:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
anytime we bring up a zoning ordinance
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
change it has failed in this committee
 
05:10:45.628 --> 05:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
for just the reasons you're talking
 
05:10:48.788 --> 05:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
about do you see that being a pattern
 
05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
that um is ineffective or needs to
 
05:10:56.110 --> 05:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
change you mean the current procedures
 
05:10:59.230 --> 05:10:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that the history of of
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
zoning Statewide zoning changes
 
05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
have not succeeded in this house well
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
this isn't a Statewide zoning change
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
this leaves it up to each of 234
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to determine what their
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
zoning policy is the reason that I
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
included all of the federal laws that be
 
05:11:21.548 --> 05:11:21.558 align:start position:0%
on zoning is because should this be
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
adopted those would be the laws that
 
05:11:23.760 --> 05:11:25.270 align:start position:0%
adopted those would be the laws that
would

05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
apply the municipalities here in New
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be free to determine
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
course period okay thank
 
05:11:39.190 --> 05:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
you represent Brown thank you Mr
 
05:11:40.590 --> 05:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:11:42.910 --> 05:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
question so I'm I'm new to this
 
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee this year this past year so
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand what you're
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
trying to do here because my
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
understanding is New Hampshire is not a
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
home rulle state right that the state
 
05:11:54.910 --> 05:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
delegates its auor its authority to the
 
05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
municipality so what you're saying by
 
05:12:00.910 --> 05:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
doing this is it's it's delegating this
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
authority to each local municipality now
 
05:12:07.230 --> 05:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
well you're talking about Dylan's rule
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and in my under in the information
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
following my
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
testimony um you can see the actual
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
dillan's 1960 or 1868 decision which
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
spawned Dylan's Rule and he says
 
05:12:28.510 --> 05:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
basically that municipalities are
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state their very
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
existence is controlled by the the state
 
05:12:34.868 --> 05:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
unless there is some constitutional
 
05:12:37.470 --> 05:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
limitation on the right this is a
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment for exactly
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
that reason this is not a bill if this
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
is adopted as a constitutional amendment
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
it wipes out any bill that conflicts
 
05:12:50.110 --> 05:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
with it that we have adopted over the
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
course of however long we've adopted it
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
point Thank you Mr so I think you just
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
answered my question so what's happening
 
05:13:04.030 --> 05:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
now is the state is relinquish
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
relinquishing its Authority in this
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
regard to the municipalities is that
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
correct only if I can get it through the
 
05:13:13.150 --> 05:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire House of Representatives
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
with a 60% vote and the state supreme
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
court with and the the state senate with
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
a 60% vote and then it is up to the
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
citizens voting in the next general
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
election this November 24th November of
 
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
24 uh to approve it by a 2third majority
 
05:13:34.510 --> 05:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
so constitutional amendments are not
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
easy to implement and that's the reason
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
why I mean everybody has to think about
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
this one and this is a big deal and it's
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
a big step bottom line
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
is the governor talks about local
 
05:13:50.670 --> 05:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
control and then he comes up with a
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board okay fine well you
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
know I tell you I'm 8 feet tall too you
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
know but the bottom line is that you
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
want local control this is local control
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
now I tend to make this an issue on the
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
next election if it doesn't get through
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the toothpaste is out
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the tube on this a lot of people here
 
05:14:14.590 --> 05:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
don't realize that uh in Dylan's rule
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know the phrase unless there is some
 
05:14:18.910 --> 05:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional limitation on the right
 
05:14:18.920 --> 05:14:20.110 align:start position:0%
constitutional limitation on the right
changes

05:14:20.110 --> 05:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
everything and that's right there in his
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
decision so yes this is a constitutional
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
amendment changes the procedure leaves
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
it up to the 234 municipalities in the
 
05:14:30.958 --> 05:14:32.670 align:start position:0%
it up to the 234 municipalities in the
state

05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:14:35.230 --> 05:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
they can draft whatever they want to and
 
05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure if someone comes in
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
Seeking a
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
waiver now there may be a better way to
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
do it I've thought about this pretty
 
05:14:46.030 --> 05:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
hard and I don't know what it' be to
 
05:14:49.590 --> 05:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
ensure the local control is maintained
 
05:14:52.750 --> 05:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's what this does thank you
 
05:14:52.760 --> 05:14:54.430 align:start position:0%
that's what this does thank you
representative

05:14:54.430 --> 05:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so on page one
 
05:15:02.548 --> 05:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
lines seven and eight beginning with the
 
05:15:05.070 --> 05:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
Clause without the prior approval of all
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
Civic veterans fraternal and not
 
05:15:11.350 --> 05:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
for-profit Association Property Owners
 
05:15:13.708 --> 05:15:13.718 align:start position:0%
I'm curious I'm looking to understand
 
05:15:18.510 --> 05:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
why those particular groups are cited in
 
05:15:20.350 --> 05:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
I'll have a followup after that well
 
05:15:23.548 --> 05:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
that's straight out of U I think it was
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
nectow uh one of the Supreme Court
 
05:15:25.680 --> 05:15:27.548 align:start position:0%
nectow uh one of the Supreme Court
decisions

05:15:27.548 --> 05:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:15:29.788 --> 05:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
basically um they're pretty close to
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
straight out of it um
 
05:15:34.030 --> 05:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between by the way
 
05:15:36.430 --> 05:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between not
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
for-profit and nonprofit and the
 
05:15:42.548 --> 05:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are basically the uh uh 501
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
C's of which there are about 25
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
different categories but in any event
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
the not for-profits of the little guys I
 
05:15:52.110 --> 05:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
offered the example of a ladies Garden
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
Club for example what are they going to
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
do if the developer says too bad well
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're out of luck but the key point is
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
if affected they have to be
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
affected now of course there's the other
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
side of the coin somebody's going to put
 
05:16:08.830 --> 05:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
in massive development and I own a
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
little tiny piece of property or I'm the
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
president of the American Legion we've
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
got a little tiny piece of property we
 
05:16:17.230 --> 05:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
look at this project and say we're right
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
at the corner we're going to be in
 
05:16:20.948 --> 05:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
McDonald's we'll be able to build the
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
biggest American Legion in the world if
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
this gets in so there are two sides to
 
05:16:25.200 --> 05:16:26.910 align:start position:0%
this gets in so there are two sides to
this

05:16:26.910 --> 05:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
coin follow up go ahead thank you Mr
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
followup so it says without the prior
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
approval so I'm curious to understand
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
what what that approval process would
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
look like that approval process would
 
05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
look very simply like you come in and
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
approve it and if you if I were a
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
developer I'd go in and say give me a
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
list of
 
05:16:52.510 --> 05:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
the veterans fraternal not for-profit
 
05:16:55.470 --> 05:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Association property owners who may be
 
05:16:57.070 --> 05:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
affected by this and I'd contact all of
 
05:16:58.948 --> 05:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
them if you if I contact the sons of
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
Italy down the road and they say we have
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
a problem with it and here it is you
 
05:17:05.070 --> 05:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
know if they say well we don't like you
 
05:17:06.670 --> 05:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
being in our ZIP code well I'm going to
 
05:17:09.990 --> 05:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
say well terribly sorry fellas but if
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
you've got a problem where it's going to
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
screw up your access to your project or
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
take half your your baseball field or
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
something like that they're going to
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to come up with some sort of an
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
accommodation in any event the long and
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
the short of it is the developer the
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
onus is on the developer to accommodate
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
the local community and if the local
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
community chooses to say not only are
 
05:17:31.548 --> 05:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
the not for-profits covered but also so
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofits it should be born in mind
 
05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
however that nonprofits are awarded that
 
05:17:38.708 --> 05:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
tax exemption by reason of the fact that
 
05:17:40.270 --> 05:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
they provide a significant Community
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
good think the Red Cross think the Boy
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
Scouts that's not a little league
 
05:17:45.750 --> 05:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
proposition I mean these guys are
 
05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
serious and they've got some muscle but
 
05:17:49.510 --> 05:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
the ladies Garden Club they don't have
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
all representative
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for taking my question
 
05:18:03.030 --> 05:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
um if I understand this
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
correctly um the terms imposed or
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
allowed should this amendment um be
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
approved by the voters of the
 
05:18:19.470 --> 05:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
state would they apply equally to an
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
individual land owner who wanted to
 
05:18:26.910 --> 05:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
let's say he had 50 acres and he wanted
 
05:18:32.548 --> 05:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
to break off 20 to give to his son
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
and in order to do that he needed a
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
frontage variance would that particular
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
land owner be subject to the
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
same criteria for approvals as the
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
developer who needs the same variance
 
05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
150 apartment building complex this
 
05:19:00.030 --> 05:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
relates only to land use and to zoning
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
so in other words if you own 100 acres
 
05:19:04.628 --> 05:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
in wish to give 5050 acres to your son I
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
don't really see where that changes the
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
land's use necessarily now if you give
 
05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
it to him if you give him the 50 acres
 
05:19:12.110 --> 05:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
and he suddenly decides he wants to put
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
in something obviously that's going to
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
have to be considered in the light of
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
the requirements that the that the
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities imposed followup
 
05:19:26.110 --> 05:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
please um so I'm talking strictly of a
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
variance for a frontage
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
requirement never mind find what the
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
ultimate use of the land is going to be
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
although in my hypothetical I did give
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
you two examples the question involves
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
that variance in the zoning regulations
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
for a frontage requirement would they
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
apply equally to me who wants to give 10
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
acres to my son and would they apply
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
equally to the developer who needs that
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
variance for his 150 unit apartment
 
05:20:06.270 --> 05:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
complex I'm not sure I understand your
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
question if you're saying first of all
 
05:20:10.030 --> 05:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
there 234 minp alties determine their
 
05:20:10.040 --> 05:20:10.788 align:start position:0%
there 234 minp alties determine their
own

05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:20:16.390 --> 05:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
policies so I'm not sure why you need a
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
variance if what you're saying is if
 
05:20:22.990 --> 05:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
your property then would no longer have
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
a 100 Acre Frontage it would only have a
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
50 acre Frontage and then your son would
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
own a separate 50 acre
 
05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
Frontage obviously that reduces the
 
05:20:34.830 --> 05:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
the ability of that piece of property to
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
be sold for a large project because
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are two owners to be involved but
 
05:20:42.430 --> 05:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.910 --> 05:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
see where you go with that if there's no
 
05:20:46.920 --> 05:20:49.788 align:start position:0%
see where you go with that if there's no
variance

05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
requirement it's up to municipality is
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
basically the way I see it maybe I'm
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
mistaken but go ahead
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh go go ahead
 
05:21:02.830 --> 05:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
Julie uh I yield to my colleague no you
 
05:21:05.948 --> 05:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
may not representative
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
kale thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question you stated earlier
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
that um about 95% of the time the
 
05:21:14.310 --> 05:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board has ruled in favor
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the developers is there any
 
05:21:20.310 --> 05:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
particular situation um that they have
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
done that that is egregiously you know
 
05:21:24.510 --> 05:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
of that is egregiously cost taxpayers of
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
a municipality like in a scenario that
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative priest was describing
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
like with with infrastructure like an
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
extreme burden put on is there a
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
specific example that that has caused
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
well I think you're going to hear about
 
05:21:40.270 --> 05:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
one in a few minutes from the uh one of
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the planning board members in Swansea
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
who's going to talk about that but I'm
 
05:21:46.270 --> 05:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
sure there are at some point I mean the
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities have opposed these things
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's why it's wound up before
 
05:21:54.390 --> 05:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board um there was
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
one in I think eping just the other day
 
05:22:00.270 --> 05:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
I maybe it wasn't eping but in any event
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gil
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
taking another question okay I'm going
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
to follow up on uh representative fra um
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
question about uh subdividing a piece of
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
property if my zoning ordinance which is
 
05:22:17.948 --> 05:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
voted on by the legislative body
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
provides that a a housing unit or piece
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
of property needs to have 50 foot of
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
Frontage on a street before it can be
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
developed and what he has explained is
 
05:22:34.470 --> 05:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
dividing 100 ft into 50 ft would that
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
because the zoning ordinance says You
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
must have 50 ft not 100 feet you've
 
05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
divided so now they're changing what the
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
property is being changed to meet the
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance okay it's a change so
 
05:22:53.110 --> 05:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
do they have to go they would require a
 
05:22:55.750 --> 05:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
variance to do that or sub subdivision
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
lot subdivision would they would they
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
have to wait for a town meeting in order
 
05:23:03.548 --> 05:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
to actually adhere to the zoning
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
ordinance I don't see it that way that's
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
not the way I wrote it the bottom line
 
05:23:09.628 --> 05:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
is I don't see the change in the land
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
use I mean unless you're saying when
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
when I talk about land use I'm not
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
talking about ownership I'm talking
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
about land
 
05:23:21.230 --> 05:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
use and uh you know there's a big
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
difference it seems to me I mean if I
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
want to build
 
05:23:28.350 --> 05:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
something uh that should be subject to
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
the approval of the town and it should
 
05:23:30.680 --> 05:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
the approval of the town and it should
be

05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:23:34.150 --> 05:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with their master plan or
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
their guidance whatever they've provided
 
05:23:38.628 --> 05:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
for developers if I look at it and say I
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
can do that that's
 
05:23:43.110 --> 05:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
fine assuming I can do it without a
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
waiver then I should be free to do that
 
05:23:47.590 --> 05:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where the 50 and the
 
05:23:50.190 --> 05:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
100 come into that to be quite candid
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
project well depends on depends on the
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
way the town chooses to put it can I
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair yes go ahead
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
you just said it depends on the on the
 
05:24:05.948 --> 05:24:05.958 align:start position:0%
zoning that's in the town that the town
 
05:24:10.230 --> 05:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
chooses to adopt right so I'm
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
sorry the so if if a town has already
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
adopted that zoning then why do we need
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment and why do we need this
 
05:24:19.000 --> 05:24:20.548 align:start position:0%
this amendment and why do we need this
Constitutional

05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment because current well the
 
05:24:27.750 --> 05:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
community is free after this
 
05:24:30.750 --> 05:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is adopted to
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
develop whatever policies it chooses to
 
05:24:35.350 --> 05:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
develop that's why I say there are 234
 
05:24:37.708 --> 05:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
communities and the bottom line is that
 
05:24:40.270 --> 05:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
once well once those policies are put
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
down you'd need a variance if it changes
 
05:24:44.270 --> 05:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
the land
 
05:24:46.548 --> 05:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
use but you're not changing the land use
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
from where I'm sitting and I don't think
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's what the law would require either
 
05:24:52.270 --> 05:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
and I've read a ton of stuff about
 
05:24:52.280 --> 05:24:56.070 align:start position:0%
and I've read a ton of stuff about
zoning

05:24:56.070 --> 05:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.788 --> 05:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
so represent power thank you Mr chair
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking another
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
question so it's my understanding that
 
05:25:06.910 --> 05:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board makes the
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
decisions in a very narrow framework and
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
that is they they look at the appeal and
 
05:25:15.310 --> 05:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
they make their decision based on number
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
one are the New Hampshire statutes being
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
followed yes or
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
no is the local locality following their
 
05:25:28.150 --> 05:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
own ordinances yes or no or are they the
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
local boards are they just making things
 
05:25:32.510 --> 05:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
up as they go along and it's the wild
 
05:25:37.390 --> 05:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
west so that's a very um specific and
 
05:25:37.400 --> 05:25:38.548 align:start position:0%
west so that's a very um specific and
narrow

05:25:38.548 --> 05:25:38.558 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
criteria um for which the housing
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
appeals board makes their decisions um
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding as well my
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is the housing appeals
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
board makes a decision based on what
 
05:25:53.350 --> 05:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
they wish to
 
05:25:56.430 --> 05:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
do now to my way of thinking it
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
generally has to conform with the
 
05:26:00.830 --> 05:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
current laws but by the same token they
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
remove the local aspect of this in large
 
05:26:08.190 --> 05:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
measure now those policies I sat on a
 
05:26:11.350 --> 05:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
planning board and we would adhere to
 
05:26:14.510 --> 05:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Law's requirement was
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
so there were many cases where we
 
05:26:17.830 --> 05:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
weren't happy with a project but we
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
approved it in any
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
event now you're going to hear from a
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
member of the planning board in Swansea
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
who has something like six or eight
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
years experience on the board and he's
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of this and a lot of projects
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
that have just come in here in the last
 
05:26:31.948 --> 05:26:31.958 align:start position:0%
couple years years they're changing the
 
05:26:33.708 --> 05:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
character of the Town dramatically
 
05:26:35.990 --> 05:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's not an isolated case there are
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
plenty of those around the state so I
 
05:26:41.230 --> 05:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly what the the
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of the housing appeals
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
board are but I do know that there is a
 
05:26:47.948 --> 05:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
lot of dissatisfaction across the state
 
05:26:49.548 --> 05:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
from a lot of people in a lot of
 
05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
different towns who spent a lot of time
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
working on
 
05:26:55.788 --> 05:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
this and obviously it's better if they
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
decide instead of the housing appeals
 
05:27:00.670 --> 05:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
board thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:27:03.150 --> 05:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
taking my followup so I hear what you're
 
05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
saying is that the the dissatisfaction
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
comes in when the local control or that
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
local aspect has been
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
overridden yeah overridden what whatever
 
05:27:20.110 --> 05:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
adverb you want to um choose so then is
 
05:27:22.510 --> 05:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
is not the real issue some of our
 
05:27:25.230 --> 05:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
statutes that we have on the books that
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't that don't um point to or allow or
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
enable the local control it's more of
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
saying that's why this is a
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment because it
 
05:27:41.708 --> 05:27:41.718 align:start position:0%
clears all of that
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
up thank you representative uh
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
priest thank you for taking my question
 
05:27:51.150 --> 05:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
and um and thank you for allowing me to
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
question again um what I see in this
 
05:27:58.310 --> 05:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill is a way for local
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
governments to buy bypass their
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility for let's say building
 
05:28:07.230 --> 05:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
affordable housing if a developer comes
 
05:28:10.150 --> 05:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
into your community meets
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
your zoning master plan infrastructure
 
05:28:18.270 --> 05:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
but the town's people are saying we
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't want those kind of people living
 
05:28:22.230 --> 05:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
in our
 
05:28:25.708 --> 05:28:25.718 align:start position:0%
community and so they deny the project
 
05:28:29.230 --> 05:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
because of their income structure so
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
then this developer can take your
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
community to the housing appeals board
 
05:28:36.590 --> 05:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
and said look we've met the zoning we
 
05:28:39.628 --> 05:28:39.638 align:start position:0%
let the infrastructure but they don't
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
want the prospect of those people moving
 
05:28:44.708 --> 05:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
into your community is that a correct
 
05:28:48.030 --> 05:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
assumption no to my way of thinking this
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
allows the community to lay out its
 
05:28:53.150 --> 05:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines if as you suggest a developer
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
wishes to come in and develop Workforce
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
housing if it meets the guidelines it
 
05:29:02.350 --> 05:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
should go through like through cous
 
05:29:04.230 --> 05:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
Bingo now there shouldn't be a whole lot
 
05:29:05.948 --> 05:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
of trouble assuming that the developer
 
05:29:07.708 --> 05:29:07.718 align:start position:0%
meets the financial requirements to be
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
able to complete the project and all the
 
05:29:10.830 --> 05:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the requirements and it should
 
05:29:12.510 --> 05:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
go through the process of providing all
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
the information to the town and
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything else but if it meets the
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines that the community has set
 
05:29:22.030 --> 05:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
forward in advance then there's no basis
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
to deny that and that's what they've
 
05:29:26.628 --> 05:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
said they want it yeah now this will
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
permit the developer of the community
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
rather to deny developer the developer
 
05:29:34.510 --> 05:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to build
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
if he has to go in for a waiver and the
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
community chooses to turn it down now
 
05:29:42.030 --> 05:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
there's the other side of the coin they
 
05:29:44.070 --> 05:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
may choose to go ahead with it but it
 
05:29:45.868 --> 05:29:45.878 align:start position:0%
also provides communities which are
 
05:29:48.110 --> 05:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
anxious to have Workforce Development to
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
provide a guideline which makes it very
 
05:29:52.708 --> 05:29:52.718 align:start position:0%
easy for a developer to come in and very
 
05:29:55.270 --> 05:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
quickly build exactly what you're
 
05:29:58.990 --> 05:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
talking about so as I said this makes it
 
05:30:01.390 --> 05:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
really easy for some developer for a
 
05:30:03.708 --> 05:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
community that seeks development to get
 
05:30:05.788 --> 05:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
it they don't have to go to the state
 
05:30:07.868 --> 05:30:07.878 align:start position:0%
for all of the things that are requested
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
in for example 538 they can just proceed
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
to lay it out developer comes in says
 
05:30:16.270 --> 05:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
great I can do it I want to do it I meet
 
05:30:17.990 --> 05:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
the financial requirements give you all
 
05:30:19.990 --> 05:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
my plans and everything else everybody
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
says yep meets all the requirements have
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
at it because they've in effect asked
 
05:30:27.150 --> 05:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
developers to come in and do precisely
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
that if however you are a small rural
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
rural community and you wish to remain
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
the way you are I have absolutely no
 
05:30:37.230 --> 05:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
problem with them saying single family
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
homes 10 acres on Case Closed to my way
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
of thinking it falls to the community if
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're a community and I've as I say
 
05:30:46.470 --> 05:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
I've written to most of the major mayors
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the state with this I don't know what
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
they did with it but I have talked to
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
some of their people about it and
 
05:30:55.390 --> 05:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
basically if somebody says we want it
 
05:30:57.548 --> 05:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
this makes it easier to do it I
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the community and the
 
05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
business community in this state is
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
looking for more Workforce housing this
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent that it prevents it in
 
05:31:09.030 --> 05:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
certain communities that don't want it
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
but the communities that do want it can
 
05:31:15.548 --> 05:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.910 --> 05:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
Spades representative
 
05:31:20.070 --> 05:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
majority thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking another question um would
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
would this amendment eliminate the need
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
for a designation of regional impact
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
what would Regional impact as far as I'm
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
concerned it would okay thank you I mean
 
05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
this this the whole purpose of this is
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
to leave it 100% in the hands of the
 
05:31:40.200 --> 05:31:42.110 align:start position:0%
to leave it 100% in the hands of the
towns

05:31:42.110 --> 05:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
towns
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question so you keep on
 
05:31:47.708 --> 05:31:47.718 align:start position:0%
talking about the local tyranny that you
 
05:31:51.310 --> 05:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
want to allow with this however in lines
 
05:31:54.270 --> 05:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
9 through 15 you're essentially
 
05:31:58.110 --> 05:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
mandating those um municipalities to
 
05:32:01.830 --> 05:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
have a certain uh
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
process before they approve and so
 
05:32:06.030 --> 05:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying that you want to
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
allow the local tyranny in some senses
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
and then you're forcing them to abide by
 
05:32:14.350 --> 05:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
your uh approval process for another
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
sense so I'm just wondering your last
 
05:32:18.910 --> 05:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
statement you said I want
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
100% uh flexibility for those
 
05:32:24.830 --> 05:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities but in this article
 
05:32:27.310 --> 05:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
there's not 100% flexibility so I'm just
 
05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
wondering uh why you um oh but there is
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
so if you're a municipality you get to
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
decide your policy period there's
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in there that says that they
 
05:32:41.510 --> 05:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait for the 45 days prior
 
05:32:44.670 --> 05:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
to adopting the vote so this this line
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
on uh line 10 to 11 they don't actually
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
have to abide by that requirement in the
 
05:32:52.750 --> 05:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
in your constitutional amendment the
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment permits each
 
05:32:57.628 --> 05:32:57.638 align:start position:0%
locality each municipality and we have
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
234 of them to make their own policies
 
05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say you have to have this you
 
05:33:05.310 --> 05:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
have to have that you have to have the
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
other thing there are 234 different
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
solutions to this problem it seems to me
 
05:33:11.788 --> 05:33:11.798 align:start position:0%
the difference I think is that I'm
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
talking about a waiver should a
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
developer come in look at the
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that are stated and seek a
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
waiver if he seeks a waiver then he has
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
to go through the procedure stipulated
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
if he doesn't seek a waiver he is
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
presumably going to be approved the
 
05:33:32.310 --> 05:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
develop the community will in effective
 
05:33:34.910 --> 05:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
ask developers to come in and meet those
 
05:33:36.548 --> 05:33:36.558 align:start position:0%
requirements he meets them he
 
05:33:39.868 --> 05:33:39.878 align:start position:0%
builds seems to
 
05:33:42.510 --> 05:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
make represent
 
05:33:45.310 --> 05:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:33:53.190 --> 05:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
um listening to your testimony and your
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
responses to the questions of my
 
05:33:56.638 --> 05:33:58.310 align:start position:0%
responses to the questions of my
colleagues

05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
I I can only only assume that the
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of this
 
05:34:10.190 --> 05:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
amendment arises or the the reason for
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment arises out of
 
05:34:13.440 --> 05:34:15.070 align:start position:0%
this amendment arises out of
your

05:34:15.070 --> 05:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:34:17.948 --> 05:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction with the decision record
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the housing appeals board in the
 
05:34:28.510 --> 05:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
appeals process and as such you want
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
to base basically throw out the baby
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
with the bath water uh would that be a
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
correct assumption not entirely I'm
 
05:34:39.030 --> 05:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
certainly not happy with the housing
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
appeals board so I can agree with you
 
05:34:43.548 --> 05:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
there but the fact is that this sh this
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
is real local control and the first
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
question I went to was whether or not
 
05:34:53.110 --> 05:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
Dylan's law Dylan's rule had a provision
 
05:34:55.470 --> 05:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
in there which I found right there in
 
05:34:57.830 --> 05:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
the paragraph that matters unless there
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
is some constitutional limitation on the
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
right I believe in local
 
05:35:02.000 --> 05:35:03.788 align:start position:0%
right I believe in local
control

05:35:03.788 --> 05:35:03.798 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:35:03.798 --> 05:35:06.110 align:start position:0%
control
period

05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead follow up uh thank you
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
so might it
 
05:35:18.670 --> 05:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
be a a better course of action to
 
05:35:21.910 --> 05:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
examine ways in which the housing
 
05:35:25.948 --> 05:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
appeals board can be fixed rather than
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
to try
 
05:35:31.670 --> 05:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
to that doesn't that doesn't no I don't
 
05:35:33.510 --> 05:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
think so that doesn't address the issues
 
05:35:37.230 --> 05:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
for example in 538 I mean you've got a
 
05:35:39.470 --> 05:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill there which seeks permission to do
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
any number of things which this would
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
give a municipality the authority to do
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
right off the bat and that's not the
 
05:35:48.270 --> 05:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
only Bill that has come along like that
 
05:35:50.110 --> 05:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
there are many of them they come up
 
05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
every year so the truth of the matter is
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
if I were the mayor of nashille or
 
05:35:56.830 --> 05:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester or conquer or any other major
 
05:36:00.510 --> 05:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
city in the state who presumably seeks
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
um development have indicated they do
 
05:36:05.548 --> 05:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
anyway I would think this is a great
 
05:36:07.390 --> 05:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
idea bottom line is I'm going to be able
 
05:36:08.830 --> 05:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
to DET turn my own policies I don't have
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
to ask for anything from the state of
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I can get right to it I
 
05:36:18.430 --> 05:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.708 --> 05:36:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr
 
05:36:32.230 --> 05:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:32.240 --> 05:36:33.708 align:start position:0%
 
can

05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
you what do I want to call it graph it
 
05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
or give us the line diagram of when the
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
contractor comes in and guest Den I you
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
know and bring it all the way to the
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
other end who makes the final
 
05:36:52.310 --> 05:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
decision the final decision on the
 
05:36:55.150 --> 05:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
waiver if he seeks a waiver the voters
 
05:36:57.270 --> 05:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
make the final decision at the municipal
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
election in March who's going to sign
 
05:37:02.670 --> 05:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
off on it who's what who's signing off
 
05:37:02.680 --> 05:37:03.708 align:start position:0%
off on it who's what who's signing off
on

05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
it the tally at the end of the day on
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
Election Day I mean you either have the
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
60% of the vote or you don't if you
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't Project's denied the waivers
 
05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
denied excuse
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
me so in other words if you come in as a
 
05:37:21.670 --> 05:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
developer and seek a
 
05:37:23.948 --> 05:37:23.958 align:start position:0%
waiver you tell the community I'm going
 
05:37:26.430 --> 05:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
to seek a waiver Community is going to
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
say well we have to prepare that and
 
05:37:30.230 --> 05:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's a $5,000 charge whatever give us
 
05:37:32.310 --> 05:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
all of your data we'll proceed to
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
process this put it together have to
 
05:37:37.350 --> 05:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
complete it before 45 days 45 days in
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
advance of the municipal election and
 
05:37:40.510 --> 05:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
then on the municipal election date of
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
the municipal election the developer
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
gets a decision it's either approved or
 
05:37:44.638 --> 05:37:46.270 align:start position:0%
gets a decision it's either approved or
it's

05:37:46.270 --> 05:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:37:50.430 --> 05:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
not follow up Mr chair go ahead thank
 
05:37:50.440 --> 05:37:54.510 align:start position:0%
not follow up Mr chair go ahead thank
you

05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.990 --> 05:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
um but in the
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
end it's going to come back to somebody
 
05:38:04.030 --> 05:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
to take possession of it or take you
 
05:38:05.788 --> 05:38:05.798 align:start position:0%
know if it goes to the president or the
 
05:38:08.350 --> 05:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court or whatever they make a
 
05:38:13.070 --> 05:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:15.750 --> 05:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
decision yes if it's if it's approved
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
then you give the green light to the
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.430 --> 05:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
digging we'll talk about
 
05:38:26.910 --> 05:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
G um so you said this could be used by
 
05:38:34.590 --> 05:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
both pro-development communities and
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
anti-development communities I'm
 
05:38:41.110 --> 05:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
wondering which of the two positions
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
towards development would you consider
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be more common or likely to occur
 
05:38:52.270 --> 05:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
communities well I there are 234
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New Hampshire and a
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
lot of them are very small and I don't
 
05:39:00.910 --> 05:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
think they're particularly friendly to
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
the idea that somebody's going to come
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
in and change the character of their
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
communities but okay so followup um in
 
05:39:11.230 --> 05:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
terms of percentage of the population
 
05:39:11.240 --> 05:39:12.070 align:start position:0%
terms of percentage of the population
hold

05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
hold
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
on when a question is asked let the um
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
witness or the testifier finish first
 
05:39:21.868 --> 05:39:21.878 align:start position:0%
and then we can follow up in terms of
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
the population that's affected uh it
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
seems to me that a very large percentage
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the population in the cities in large
 
05:39:30.910 --> 05:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
measure would um you know find that
 
05:39:33.310 --> 05:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
they're developing because I I
 
05:39:35.628 --> 05:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
understand that that's where most of the
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
desire for development is but a
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
community that seeks development in
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
Peterboro for example they're doing a
 
05:39:43.030 --> 05:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
lot of building they're happy to have it
 
05:39:45.990 --> 05:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's great now the
 
05:39:46.000 --> 05:39:48.948 align:start position:0%
that's great now the
followup

05:39:48.948 --> 05:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:39:48.958 --> 05:39:54.310 align:start position:0%
followup
so

05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
um all right actually never mind I lost
 
05:39:58.350 --> 05:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
my TR
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
thought okay repres representative major
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:40:06.468 --> 05:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
taking another question um piggybacking
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
a little bit on representative Tetro so
 
05:40:11.468 --> 05:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
the if I understand this correctly is it
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
true that the legislative body would
 
05:40:16.350 --> 05:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
approve this this
 
05:40:19.868 --> 05:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
project the registry of deeds then has a
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
project that is stamped in some way that
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
says approved at town
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
meeting because the registry of deeds
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
needs a myar that says some that says
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
it's approved approved I'm just trying
 
05:40:31.830 --> 05:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out how the regist doesn't get
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
approved until if if a waiver is sought
 
05:40:35.948 --> 05:40:35.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get approved until the voters
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
approve it and
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
how CLA so what would the registry of
 
05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
what would be on file at the registry
 
05:40:45.000 --> 05:40:47.590 align:start position:0%
what would be on file at the registry
pending

05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
pending
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
pending I mean it's there's no it's
 
05:40:54.030 --> 05:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
approved sorry well if if the guidelines
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
that the state that the the municipality
 
05:41:00.030 --> 05:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
puts out require a waiver
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
then it can't be approved until after
 
05:41:03.868 --> 05:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
the voters have approved it if the
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
voters approve it if they choose not to
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
approve it then it's not
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
approved until then the property stands
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
as it is I mean if you're asking what's
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
the tax status of it stays in the hands
 
05:41:19.230 --> 05:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:22.590 --> 05:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
owner further
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
much think got one over here oh I'm
 
05:41:30.430 --> 05:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
sorry represent Gilman
 
05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for one
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
last question um I'm going to follow up
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
on representative Major's uh
 
05:41:41.670 --> 05:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
comments you understood that a myar or
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
final or a drawing of a project needs to
 
05:41:47.868 --> 05:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
be uh stamped as pending before a
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
decision is made by the legislative body
 
05:41:51.590 --> 05:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
no before the decision is made by the
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
voters well they're the legislative body
 
05:41:58.948 --> 05:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
in technical language here um so after
 
05:41:58.958 --> 05:41:59.830 align:start position:0%
in technical language here um so after
that

05:41:59.830 --> 05:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:42:03.548 --> 05:42:03.558 align:start position:0%
vote it's approved but what is what does
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds going to have on
 
05:42:08.390 --> 05:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
their drawing to prove it's been
 
05:42:10.750 --> 05:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
approved we need like right now you need
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
a stamp of an engineer or
 
05:42:16.510 --> 05:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
architect that says it's approved by you
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
know planning board or whoever so the
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
how who's in control of the project
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
after the voters vote after the voters
 
05:42:27.468 --> 05:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
vote the decision's
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
made but how do you prove it I'm sorry
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the vote the vote is they
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
either approve it or they
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
don't that's why this is a
 
05:42:36.558 --> 05:42:37.708 align:start position:0%
don't that's why this is a
constitutional

05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
05:42:43.230 --> 05:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:45.910 --> 05:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:42:51.910 --> 05:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
fra U if I may perhaps rephrase the uh
 
05:42:54.070 --> 05:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
the question of the last two
 
05:42:54.080 --> 05:42:55.590 align:start position:0%
the question of the last two
speakers

05:42:55.590 --> 05:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
05:42:59.548 --> 05:42:59.558 align:start position:0%
um as chair of our planning board in in
 
05:43:03.150 --> 05:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
the town of Enfield okay once we approve
 
05:43:03.160 --> 05:43:04.190 align:start position:0%
the town of Enfield okay once we approve
a

05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:43:09.390 --> 05:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
project I have to sign a myar which then
 
05:43:11.948 --> 05:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
goes to the registar of
 
05:43:16.110 --> 05:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
Deeds what the two previous speakers are
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
asking I believe is once the voters
 
05:43:24.990 --> 05:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
approve of a project which requires a
 
05:43:26.948 --> 05:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
variance or a
 
05:43:31.548 --> 05:43:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:34.510 --> 05:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
my whoever would sign it before it's now
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
approved the voter look that's why this
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional
 
05:43:41.830 --> 05:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment okay bottom line is until the
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
voters move on it there's no decision no
 
05:43:47.548 --> 05:43:47.558 align:start position:0%
final decision if they seek a waiver now
 
05:43:48.910 --> 05:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't seek a waiver there's no
 
05:43:50.510 --> 05:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
problem it's exactly the way it's
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be now just goes right
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
through that's why this is a
 
05:43:54.958 --> 05:43:56.430 align:start position:0%
through that's why this is a
constitutional

05:43:56.430 --> 05:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
amendment the new requirement is right
 
05:43:58.798 --> 05:44:01.390 align:start position:0%
amendment the new requirement is right
here

05:44:01.390 --> 05:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:01.400 --> 05:44:03.270 align:start position:0%
 
further

05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:44:06.510 --> 05:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
questions I see no more could I ask
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
before you run away though I'm not going
 
05:44:12.750 --> 05:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
away from what I've been trying to
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
gather here that a a lot of
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
the or a good percentage of the problems
 
05:44:25.708 --> 05:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
uh that you suggest are out
 
05:44:29.230 --> 05:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
there is the is found in the housing
 
05:44:31.070 --> 05:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
appeals board is that correct just yes
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
or no no they're an example of the
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
problem okay the problem here is that
 
05:44:38.910 --> 05:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
the local community I spoke to a
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
resident of I think it was Sullivan the
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
other day he said my taxes went up 25% I
 
05:44:45.750 --> 05:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
coming point is this should all be up to
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
local control something that changes the
 
05:44:53.030 --> 05:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
nature of your
 
05:44:55.868 --> 05:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
community if it doesn't fit into exactly
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
what you've laid out in the way of what
 
05:45:00.670 --> 05:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
you're prepared to consider and accept
 
05:45:03.628 --> 05:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.990 --> 05:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't they for the most
 
05:45:15.390 --> 05:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
part and I know what you're trying to
 
05:45:17.708 --> 05:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
accomplish I get that but for the most
 
05:45:20.110 --> 05:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
part don't those 234
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have the ability
 
05:45:26.468 --> 05:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
to determine their zoning
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
regulations most of them do but the
 
05:45:31.350 --> 05:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
point is that they are being overridden
 
05:45:34.190 --> 05:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
by the housing appeals board that's a
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
significant issue and that's not my only
 
05:45:39.750 --> 05:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
issue okay but hold
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
on but that has been the response I've
 
05:45:44.830 --> 05:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
heard on a lot is the housing appeals
 
05:45:48.270 --> 05:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
board my question is by it let's just
 
05:45:50.670 --> 05:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
say this bill was to eliminate the
 
05:45:53.628 --> 05:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board would that
 
05:45:56.468 --> 05:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
solve 90% of the problems it solve a
 
05:45:57.708 --> 05:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
good part of them but I don't think it'
 
05:46:00.310 --> 05:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
solve 90% would Sol a significant number
 
05:46:02.670 --> 05:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
to my way of thinking the the approval
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
process I've heard from I've spoken to a
 
05:46:06.510 --> 05:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
number of towns about this and some of
 
05:46:08.670 --> 05:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
the people in the town say yeah you know
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
what regulatory capture is well that's
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
when a town that's when a governing body
 
05:46:14.468 --> 05:46:14.478 align:start position:0%
gets taken over by an industry and the
 
05:46:17.310 --> 05:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
developers own our Z zoning appeals
 
05:46:19.390 --> 05:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
board now they've got the ability to
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
change that at this moment but the truth
 
05:46:22.830 --> 05:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
of the matter is this is a cleaner
 
05:46:24.670 --> 05:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
easier way to do it and we get rid of
 
05:46:27.310 --> 05:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
all of the options or all of the
 
05:46:29.628 --> 05:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
difficulties at the moment with the
 
05:46:32.190 --> 05:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities seeking State approval
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
for this that and the other thing they
 
05:46:37.390 --> 05:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
can do that their own okay all right
 
05:46:38.910 --> 05:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
05:46:40.590 --> 05:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony we are going to
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.230 --> 05:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
dcrb Mr chair members of the committee
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh name is Philip Sherman the chair of
 
05:47:00.430 --> 05:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
the building code review board uh most
 
05:47:01.948 --> 05:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
of you know we developed the state
 
05:47:04.110 --> 05:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
building code for ratification by the
 
05:47:06.590 --> 05:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
general court I speak in opposition to
 
05:47:09.070 --> 05:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
this bill primarily due to what I think
 
05:47:12.390 --> 05:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
or hope are unintended consequences my
 
05:47:14.190 --> 05:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
comments arise because many of the
 
05:47:16.270 --> 05:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
municipal actions relative to building
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
codes reside in the RSA 670 series on
 
05:47:23.390 --> 05:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
land use this proposed Constitutional
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment would require that a project
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
seeking a change a variance or a waiver
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
to the code would require approval of
 
05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
the parties named in the bill would
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
require a financial impact statement and
 
05:47:37.390 --> 05:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
then require it be approved by
 
05:47:40.030 --> 05:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of the voters at the annual
 
05:47:42.510 --> 05:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
meeting the building and fire codes
 
05:47:44.910 --> 05:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
currently permit changes to the specific
 
05:47:47.150 --> 05:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
requirements of the codes based on
 
05:47:49.350 --> 05:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
modifications to the code or
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
justification of alternative means and
 
05:47:53.670 --> 05:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
methods and in fact the fire code
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
permits variances through the State Fire
 
05:47:58.990 --> 05:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
Marshall each of these routs is reviewed
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
and approved by officials knowledgeable
 
05:48:04.510 --> 05:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
of both codes and construction a local
 
05:48:06.390 --> 05:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
and state appeals route is available
 
05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
involving local Boards of appeal many
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
times the zba and the State Building
 
05:48:13.310 --> 05:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
Code review board and then on to the
 
05:48:16.590 --> 05:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
various courts from there a constit this
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment would for the
 
05:48:21.150 --> 05:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
most part effectively remove the ability
 
05:48:23.788 --> 05:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
of a proponent to utilize better more
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
cost effective or more technologically
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
advanced means of construction or to
 
05:48:30.590 --> 05:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
deal with conditions that were not
 
05:48:33.390 --> 05:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the codes somebody comes
 
05:48:35.548 --> 05:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
up with a new kind of water faucet that
 
05:48:37.708 --> 05:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
hasn't been approved by the codes yet
 
05:48:39.868 --> 05:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
would wind up going through this process
 
05:48:41.830 --> 05:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
because they'd need a change to the
 
05:48:44.670 --> 05:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
specific words of the code I recommend
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill fail but if it must pass
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
please consider limiting it to zoning
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
issues not land use issues in general
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.520 --> 05:48:59.868 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%

05:48:59.878 --> 05:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
questions
other

05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:49:03.510 --> 05:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:49:10.708 --> 05:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
welcome uh next

Reynolds
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
hi so I'm just speaking speaking for
 
05:49:31.670 --> 05:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
myself I'm a member of the public and I
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire a couple years
 
05:49:36.670 --> 05:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
ago from Portland
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
Oregon I recently went to a deliberative
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
session first time I've done that in my
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
small town and I loved it it was so
 
05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
impressive it was definitely democracy
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
in action and I had a chance to go over
 
05:49:51.680 --> 05:49:52.430 align:start position:0%
in action and I had a chance to go over
the

05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:55.468 --> 05:49:55.478 align:start position:0%
budget carefully and hear from the
 
05:49:58.590 --> 05:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
people why the budget was the way it was
 
05:50:01.708 --> 05:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
and it turns out we're really poor I
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
can't believe how many things are so
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive I had no idea and
 
05:50:10.590 --> 05:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
they were talking about trying to find
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
like a used truck of some kind you I
 
05:50:15.390 --> 05:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
think they had a plow or something they
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
needed and they're like well we've been
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
looking for a used one and we're trying
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
to get a grant for this truck I was like
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
it was an eye opener for me so actually
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
I thought we had local control it's
 
05:50:30.510 --> 05:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
really been a new information for me to
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
find out that the state can decide
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
things for the towns and I can see all
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems with that immediately
 
05:50:42.750 --> 05:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
and of I've been walking past uh a new
 
05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
development uh that is on Route 10 on
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
the way to the post office and every
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
time I go by it I kind of wonder what
 
05:50:52.070 --> 05:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
does this mean because it's a lot of
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
people all of a sudden in this one
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
little area and it's going to mean
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
something in terms of traffic who knows
 
05:50:59.708 --> 05:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
if we're going to need to have a new
 
05:51:02.750 --> 05:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
traffic light I mean it's it's an
 
05:51:05.548 --> 05:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
unknown and it's the kind of thing that
 
05:51:07.628 --> 05:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
I would really want to be locally
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
figured out locally decided and have you
 
05:51:13.628 --> 05:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
know just have the the ability to
 
05:51:16.468 --> 05:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
control how fast things happen What
 
05:51:20.670 --> 05:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
Happens can our taxes cover it Etc so I
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I do support this
 
05:51:27.910 --> 05:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill I support anything that uh is local
 
05:51:30.910 --> 05:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
that that creates local control for
 
05:51:34.030 --> 05:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
things that matter a great deal to me
 
05:51:36.830 --> 05:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
and to the people who live in our town
 
05:51:38.270 --> 05:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you so
 
05:51:40.750 --> 05:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
you seeing no
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.280 --> 05:52:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
York

05:52:01.070 --> 05:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:02.788 --> 05:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody thanks for hearing
 
05:52:06.310 --> 05:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
us um I have been an eight-year member
 
05:52:08.030 --> 05:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the Swansea planning board hav been
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
the vice chair a couple of
 
05:52:14.670 --> 05:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
times uh my citizens in my town are
 
05:52:18.910 --> 05:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
coming to us and wanting more local
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
control right now Swansea is about 7200
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
people in buts Keen which is a larger
 
05:52:29.510 --> 05:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
municipality and they're busting it the
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
seams we understand that but we don't
 
05:52:35.230 --> 05:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
feel it is the people in my town don't
 
05:52:37.590 --> 05:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
feel it's their responsibility to build
 
05:52:39.990 --> 05:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
housing for the city of Kean so that we
 
05:52:42.430 --> 05:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
can incur all the cost that comes with
 
05:52:45.350 --> 05:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
more people while King gets the benefit
 
05:52:47.190 --> 05:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
for these people to work in their
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
town now we have not been we have been
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
very generous to this point of allowing
 
05:52:56.990 --> 05:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh multiple housing in the we have over
 
05:52:58.830 --> 05:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
500 units have been approved in the last
 
05:52:58.840 --> 05:53:00.590 align:start position:0%
500 units have been approved in the last
two

05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
years okay on the planning board what we
 
05:53:07.390 --> 05:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
go by is our zoning regulations the rsas
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
that are involved and a site plan we
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
have one project in town that's gone
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
through um legal problems I can't speak
 
05:53:17.468 --> 05:53:17.478 align:start position:0%
a lot of it right now because it doesn't
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
not have final approval and there's
 
05:53:22.350 --> 05:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
always a possibility it could come back
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the planning board or the zba in some
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
manner so I can't really speak of that
 
05:53:30.990 --> 05:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
right now but there is an issue there
 
05:53:33.310 --> 05:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
now with Jim's plan this this
 
05:53:33.320 --> 05:53:34.670 align:start position:0%
now with Jim's plan this this
Constitutional

05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
05:53:37.830 --> 05:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh then the state would have
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
less authority over us they would the
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
habb would basically go away which is a
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
good thing because there are many many
 
05:53:47.150 --> 05:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
cases and I can't cite them I should
 
05:53:48.830 --> 05:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
have brought a couple today where
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
they've overridden the intent of the
 
05:53:53.190 --> 05:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
planning board when they wrote the
 
05:53:56.830 --> 05:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
zoning and the people approved
 
05:54:00.190 --> 05:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
it this also the case I'm talking about
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
in Swansea involves Superior Court and
 
05:54:04.990 --> 05:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court which you
 
05:54:07.230 --> 05:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
would think well that won't go away yes
 
05:54:09.310 --> 05:54:09.320 align:start position:0%
it will because the courts are going to
 
05:54:10.830 --> 05:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
have to obey the Constitutional
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment we know that they'll have to
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
do that and they
 
05:54:18.430 --> 05:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
would um but that it's all about local
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
control now we don't turn down what we
 
05:54:25.030 --> 05:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
do is I look at
 
05:54:27.310 --> 05:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
project and I try to be fair to the
 
05:54:29.150 --> 05:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
and follow all of our rules and
 
05:54:36.548 --> 05:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
regulations we have this last year had
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
these Pig pares come in and people are
 
05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
coming to the board and testifying to
 
05:54:42.590 --> 05:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
the planning board that they want to
 
05:54:45.670 --> 05:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
change the zoning which we're doing but
 
05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
the fear is in most of us is that
 
05:54:50.948 --> 05:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
eventually the state can say wait a
 
05:54:52.270 --> 05:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
minute we don't still don't have enough
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
housing in the
 
05:54:56.670 --> 05:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
area so we're going to put these other
 
05:54:58.910 --> 05:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislative that will actually do away
 
05:55:01.670 --> 05:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
with our zoning override our
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
zoning uh what comes to mind was last
 
05:55:06.270 --> 05:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
year was fortunately was able to shut it
 
05:55:09.750 --> 05:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
down as s sp44 which would allowed
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
four houses built in one
 
05:55:17.390 --> 05:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
lot okay this year it's come back to
 
05:55:21.510 --> 05:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
1291 where additional Adu units can be
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
built which just creates the same thing
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
of higher
 
05:55:28.468 --> 05:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
density now Swansea has a density of
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
about 165 people per square mile so
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
large town landwise is 45 square miles
 
05:55:36.390 --> 05:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
Kean has one over
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
600 what I'm hearing from my citizens
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
who I have to answer to they don't want
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
a higher density because with higher
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
density comes more crime so you're going
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
to have to hire more police officers and
 
05:55:51.670 --> 05:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
every town out there can tell you right
 
05:55:54.750 --> 05:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
now it is very difficult to get police
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
officers people don't want to do it
 
05:55:58.110 --> 05:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
anymore because all the stuff that's
 
05:55:58.120 --> 05:55:59.150 align:start position:0%
anymore because all the stuff that's
going

05:55:59.150 --> 05:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
on um it would require us to go to a
 
05:56:04.830 --> 05:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
full-time police uh fire department well
 
05:56:06.750 --> 05:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
there is not a more
 
05:56:09.230 --> 05:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
expensive uh Department to run the a
 
05:56:09.240 --> 05:56:10.190 align:start position:0%
expensive uh Department to run the a
fire

05:56:10.190 --> 05:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
fire
 
05:56:12.468 --> 05:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
department with a town that size with
 
05:56:12.478 --> 05:56:13.390 align:start position:0%
department with a town that size with
three

05:56:13.390 --> 05:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
firehouses we would have to qu triple on
 
05:56:17.590 --> 05:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of our equipment and our
 
05:56:19.548 --> 05:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
firemen right now we're just trying to
 
05:56:21.708 --> 05:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
get a fire new Fire Station built
 
05:56:23.948 --> 05:56:23.958 align:start position:0%
because the old ones under the town hall
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be there anymore because it's
 
05:56:29.948 --> 05:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:32.190 --> 05:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
and I think I can answer one
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative's question she had right
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
away is if the town voted to allow the
 
05:56:40.628 --> 05:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
variance it would probably have to be
 
05:56:43.868 --> 05:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
still signed by the planning board chair
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
like it is done now because there has to
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
be a signature on it when it goes into
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
county and with that I'll take questions
 
05:56:57.868 --> 05:56:57.878 align:start position:0%
represent PRI thank you Mr chairman for
 
05:57:00.190 --> 05:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask a question and thank
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
you for being here and for your public
 
05:57:04.868 --> 05:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
service in Swansea I really appreciate
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
it and to the previous speaker welcome
 
05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire you're gonna love it
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
here um question it sounds like Swansea
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
does not want multifamily housing not
 
05:57:20.270 --> 05:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
anymore no we just approved 500 that's
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to be another thousand to 1500
 
05:57:25.910 --> 05:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
residents thank
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
you representative power
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I understand um what
 
05:57:36.350 --> 05:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
you're um expressing to the committee
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
and your
 
05:57:41.468 --> 05:57:41.478 align:start position:0%
concerns and it is my understanding
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
correct it sounds like that the your
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
concerns really stem
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
from leg legislation that has been
 
05:57:54.030 --> 05:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
05:57:58.230 --> 05:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
that reduces or takes away local control
 
05:58:01.110 --> 05:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
with regards to you know housing and and
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
development so my question is and and I
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
understand that we have this cacr in
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
front of
 
05:58:14.430 --> 05:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
us could one another way to to deal with
 
05:58:17.948 --> 05:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
this um issue this concern that that
 
05:58:21.510 --> 05:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
some municipalities have is through you
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
know the legislature and who you um send
 
05:58:30.070 --> 05:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
to conquer State reps and Senators
 
05:58:32.070 --> 05:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me like the the the
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
root cause is what what's being passed
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
and and signed into law is is that
 
05:58:42.590 --> 05:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
correct well what what's happening is
 
05:58:44.548 --> 05:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
the people in my town in a way and I'm
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
sure there's plenty other towns when
 
05:58:49.868 --> 05:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
they leave the decisions completely to
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
the state legislature they feel like
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
they don't have control they're not
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
going to come up here and confront you
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
people although they should we should
 
05:59:00.670 --> 05:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
have had a thousand people out here for
 
05:59:02.190 --> 05:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and every bill it goes out
 
05:59:04.230 --> 05:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
there but they will come to the local
 
05:59:06.030 --> 05:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
planning board they will come to the zba
 
05:59:08.430 --> 05:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
they will come to the selectman I would
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
like to see more people come to us so we
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
could develop the town the way we you
 
05:59:16.070 --> 05:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
know they wish but they don't they
 
05:59:18.190 --> 05:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
scream at us to get something done now
 
05:59:21.270 --> 05:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
we have a the 27th we have a meet the
 
05:59:23.468 --> 05:59:23.478 align:start position:0%
candidates for local Town elections and
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping a lot of people come there
 
05:59:26.638 --> 05:59:28.430 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping a lot of people come there
then

05:59:28.430 --> 05:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:59:28.440 --> 05:59:30.548 align:start position:0%
then
further

05:59:30.548 --> 05:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:59:33.270 --> 05:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple for you sir
 
05:59:37.030 --> 05:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
certainly um you talked about your town
 
05:59:39.110 --> 05:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh becoming a call it a bedroom
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
community of keen by the sounds of it
 
05:59:46.390 --> 05:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
um how
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
many you've been on the planning board
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
for a while in the last few years how
 
05:59:54.750 --> 05:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
many projects of any size have been
 
05:59:57.788 --> 05:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
approved been given final approval
 
06:00:00.510 --> 06:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
outside of your Town's own approval
 
06:00:02.190 --> 06:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
process in other
 
06:00:05.548 --> 06:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
words I'm assuming your zoning allows
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
for everything that has gone
 
06:00:10.708 --> 06:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
on has there
 
06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
been any housing appeal board's decision
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
that has overridden your decisions not
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
not the habb but there is one Court
 
06:00:22.990 --> 06:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
ruling from Superior Court and supreme
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
court that we lost I can't speak a lot
 
06:00:27.070 --> 06:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
of it because that's the case I'm
 
06:00:28.390 --> 06:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
talking about about it's not a final
 
06:00:31.350 --> 06:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
approval yet so as you know a planning
 
06:00:34.990 --> 06:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
board member has uh expart requirements
 
06:00:36.670 --> 06:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
where we can't talk about it sure
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
understood but there is one
 
06:00:42.788 --> 06:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
there okay so as
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
a you can't mention how many or whatever
 
06:00:49.788 --> 06:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
um but is
 
06:00:52.830 --> 06:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
it is it fair to say that the majority
 
06:00:57.590 --> 06:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
of projects or um housing or whatever
 
06:01:01.430 --> 06:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
that has gone on in your town been
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
approved yes because we follow the law
 
06:01:06.910 --> 06:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
and your zoning ordinances well yeah
 
06:01:09.310 --> 06:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
that we call that the ordinances yes and
 
06:01:10.948 --> 06:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong I understand local
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
control okay
 
06:01:18.110 --> 06:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
um the other point or question I would
 
06:01:21.190 --> 06:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
ask is you mentioned several of the
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
bills last year and this year that have
 
06:01:27.868 --> 06:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
come before us um it's my understanding
 
06:01:29.990 --> 06:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong that most of
 
06:01:33.628 --> 06:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
those bills actually got shut down in a
 
06:01:33.638 --> 06:01:35.150 align:start position:0%
those bills actually got shut down in a
very

06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:01:38.190 --> 06:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
large manner is that correct that is
 
06:01:40.390 --> 06:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
correct and hopefully that would
 
06:01:43.548 --> 06:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
continue however the people that are
 
06:01:46.350 --> 06:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
comli of the legislature now may not be
 
06:01:48.628 --> 06:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
here in five years they may decide to
 
06:01:50.548 --> 06:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
retire make get beat at the polls
 
06:01:52.270 --> 06:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you may have a complete
 
06:01:55.948 --> 06:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
different set of legislators who decide
 
06:01:57.788 --> 06:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
well we don't think they did the things
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
so let's go do with these and pass them
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't disagree with you that kind
 
06:02:03.868 --> 06:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
of goes back to representative Powers
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion though it's kind of who you
 
06:02:08.910 --> 06:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
send I think but this this would be kind
 
06:02:12.070 --> 06:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
of a guide a guard against that also y
 
06:02:14.548 --> 06:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh representative priest I sorry hand up
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my questions
 
06:02:18.590 --> 06:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my additional
 
06:02:20.868 --> 06:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
question um you believe in the
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the fact that we have
 
06:02:25.868 --> 06:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
checks and balances and that right and
 
06:02:28.910 --> 06:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
if a person is griev d by local
 
06:02:31.468 --> 06:02:31.478 align:start position:0%
controls let's say the zoning he can
 
06:02:33.948 --> 06:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
always appeal it to the
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
courts and have his case heard with this
 
06:02:40.110 --> 06:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that takes away
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
the checks and balances for that person
 
06:02:44.110 --> 06:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
correct yes it would take away those
 
06:02:49.310 --> 06:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
checks and balances um but it's with the
 
06:02:51.548 --> 06:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
towns now instead of the
 
06:02:54.030 --> 06:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
courts further
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
06:02:56.280 --> 06:03:00.510 align:start position:0%
questions represent
t

06:03:00.510 --> 06:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:03:01.840 --> 06:03:03.628 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
chair

06:03:03.628 --> 06:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:03:07.670 --> 06:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
um one I I'm I'm trying to piece
 
06:03:08.910 --> 06:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
together from
 
06:03:11.190 --> 06:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
the The
 
06:03:11.200 --> 06:03:13.948 align:start position:0%
the The
Proposal

06:03:13.948 --> 06:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
Proposal
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
um contractor comes in and this is this
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
is a question in the end it may take me
 
06:03:23.910 --> 06:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
a second to get there but
 
06:03:23.920 --> 06:03:25.590 align:start position:0%
a second to get there but
um

06:03:25.590 --> 06:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:29.548 --> 06:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
and people complain about the whatever
 
06:03:32.628 --> 06:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get approved so it goes
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
through the planning board
 
06:03:34.798 --> 06:03:37.110 align:start position:0%
through the planning board
process

06:03:37.110 --> 06:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
unapproved but then your local control
 
06:03:43.750 --> 06:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're telling you're telling your local
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
control and people to run for these
 
06:03:49.590 --> 06:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
offices nah we didn't like that answer
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
we want an answer from this
 
06:03:58.350 --> 06:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
group now um that's why I asked earlier
 
06:04:01.590 --> 06:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
since you've taken all these other
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
groups of elected officials out of the
 
06:04:10.430 --> 06:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
line who's responsible for it in the end
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
in in the end if it's voted looking for
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
variance and the first thing is they if
 
06:04:20.030 --> 06:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
they bring a project to the planning
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
board or the
 
06:04:24.030 --> 06:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
zba and it doesn't meet it needs a
 
06:04:25.510 --> 06:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
variance they're told it needs a
 
06:04:27.750 --> 06:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
variance so then they have to apply to
 
06:04:30.310 --> 06:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
the town if the town votes to approve
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
the variance then it would have to be
 
06:04:35.110 --> 06:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
signed by the planning board chair on
 
06:04:35.120 --> 06:04:36.150 align:start position:0%
signed by the planning board chair on
the

06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:38.430 --> 06:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
mara but he would have to sign it he
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
would have no choice sort of like when
 
06:04:42.910 --> 06:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
the planning board approves one now the
 
06:04:45.468 --> 06:04:45.478 align:start position:0%
chairman has to sign a
 
06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
myar thank you you made make
 
06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:55.628 --> 06:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:04:58.708 --> 06:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:05:01.750 --> 06:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
do you you must feel like you're on the
 
06:05:04.830 --> 06:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
front line of a
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
giant tug of war right now yes but I'm
 
06:05:10.590 --> 06:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
used to that I'm I was a marine for
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
eight years okay thank you very much for
 
06:05:13.120 --> 06:05:14.070 align:start position:0%
eight years okay thank you very much for
your

06:05:14.070 --> 06:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:05:19.030 --> 06:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
service um a constit constitutional
 
06:05:22.510 --> 06:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is rightfully is very
 
06:05:25.468 --> 06:05:25.478 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve you have to go
 
06:05:28.110 --> 06:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
through a lot of steps
 
06:05:32.150 --> 06:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
steps to get it done and and that's
 
06:05:36.670 --> 06:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:43.150 --> 06:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
agree is there something short of a
 
06:05:43.160 --> 06:05:45.548 align:start position:0%
agree is there something short of a
constitutional

06:05:45.548 --> 06:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
06:05:48.390 --> 06:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that would meet your needs
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
there on the front
 
06:05:56.230 --> 06:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
lines um I don't know because anything
 
06:05:58.628 --> 06:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
that the legisl ler would pass would
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
still be challenged in a court or the HB
 
06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
it could be challenged because what the
 
06:06:06.430 --> 06:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
HB looks for I've looked at a lot of the
 
06:06:08.670 --> 06:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
cases they look to see if there's a
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
commonness placed they look well how can
 
06:06:13.468 --> 06:06:13.478 align:start position:0%
we they don't look to see should they
 
06:06:15.030 --> 06:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
approve it if everything is followed I
 
06:06:17.350 --> 06:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
looked at how can I not approve it I've
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
been to their
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
meetings okay one in case is continuous
 
06:06:24.510 --> 06:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh Road Frontage as we've talked about
 
06:06:29.430 --> 06:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
here is um one Z in thing is how much um
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
continuous roage do you
 
06:06:35.150 --> 06:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
have uh Frontage on a on public road
 
06:06:36.910 --> 06:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
well if you don't put continuous in
 
06:06:38.788 --> 06:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
there you could have a piece of property
 
06:06:40.270 --> 06:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of weird properties in
 
06:06:43.310 --> 06:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
particular in Swansea where a person own
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
this part of the land then he doesn't
 
06:06:47.510 --> 06:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
own this part of the land and it goes
 
06:06:48.910 --> 06:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
back just a little bit then he owns
 
06:06:50.590 --> 06:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
another part of the land and this is all
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
connected well the
 
06:06:56.350 --> 06:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
intent of our zoning and we just changed
 
06:06:58.628 --> 06:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
the continuous if it doesn't say
 
06:07:00.990 --> 06:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
continuous in there but the guy has
 
06:07:03.788 --> 06:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
enough Frontage adding up those two then
 
06:07:05.110 --> 06:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
they'll approve
 
06:07:08.468 --> 06:07:08.478 align:start position:0%
it so it's yeah we've been meticulously
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
trying to go through our zoning to make
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
sure the intent of the people is
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
there but then again at any time the
 
06:07:20.510 --> 06:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislator so wants to they can take
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
those rights away if you would have
 
06:07:24.628 --> 06:07:24.638 align:start position:0%
passed legislation to say we have the
 
06:07:26.350 --> 06:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
power you can then turn around the next
 
06:07:27.948 --> 06:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
session and take it get
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:34.990 --> 06:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
you repres Gilman thank you Mr chair and
 
06:07:37.868 --> 06:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question um
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
with your experience on the planning
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
board uh you understand the process of
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
making changes to the zoning ordinance
 
06:07:48.510 --> 06:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
that the um changes are rep represented
 
06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
to voters uh at the annual meeting so my
 
06:07:55.590 --> 06:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
question is why e either with a project
 
06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
that uh needs approval by the
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
legislative body for a uh change because
 
06:08:05.830 --> 06:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
they want a variance or or or is um
 
06:08:10.110 --> 06:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
waiver that can only happen once a year
 
06:08:12.948 --> 06:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
how is it that those changes can't be
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
made by the planning board because they
 
06:08:17.788 --> 06:08:17.798 align:start position:0%
have to do it once a
 
06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
year you understand either way it's once
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
because the planning board although it's
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
a representative of the uh legislative
 
06:08:26.080 --> 06:08:27.590 align:start position:0%
a representative of the uh legislative
body

06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:08:30.708 --> 06:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
still it's it's uh seven people six
 
06:08:33.868 --> 06:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
regulars and plus the selectman's uh
 
06:08:35.868 --> 06:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
representative it's a representative of
 
06:08:40.270 --> 06:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
the town okay but when you got a town
 
06:08:43.390 --> 06:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
with 7200 people and we have 4600 voters
 
06:08:46.390 --> 06:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
I believe was the last count um they
 
06:08:48.510 --> 06:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily you get it
 
06:08:51.270 --> 06:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
right because sometimes in a lot of our
 
06:08:54.430 --> 06:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
our meetings we have nobody there we do
 
06:08:56.350 --> 06:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
zoning we start zoning usually in the
 
06:08:58.270 --> 06:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
middle and our site plan regulations
 
06:09:00.190 --> 06:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
usually in the middle of the year so we
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
can go through it give our public uh
 
06:09:06.910 --> 06:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
hearings but people don't always show up
 
06:09:09.110 --> 06:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
but what they'll do is after you've done
 
06:09:10.670 --> 06:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
something they'll
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
complain and I'm sure you people uh at
 
06:09:16.788 --> 06:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
the legisl have the same
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
problem we have never seen that happen
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
sir representative kale um thank you Mr
 
06:09:24.590 --> 06:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:09:26.190 --> 06:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming out here today um
 
06:09:29.190 --> 06:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
to kind of echo my colleague's
 
06:09:32.910 --> 06:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
sentiment um about is there something
 
06:09:36.110 --> 06:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
that you can do other than a
 
06:09:39.150 --> 06:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
cacr correct me if I'm wrong but can't
 
06:09:39.160 --> 06:09:40.468 align:start position:0%
cacr correct me if I'm wrong but can't
your

06:09:40.468 --> 06:09:40.478 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
town put a stop to building permits if
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate no infrastructure
 
06:09:48.670 --> 06:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
problem can't you just say hey we're
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to pull a halt on building permits
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
well if we if we did that like that then
 
06:09:55.830 --> 06:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
it would go to the HB or the courts and
 
06:09:57.430 --> 06:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
they would say yo
 
06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
hostile and they would L follow
 
06:10:04.190 --> 06:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
up what what if what if you had a
 
06:10:07.510 --> 06:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason like a leg if you have
 
06:10:09.070 --> 06:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
a legitimate reason if you have a
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason under the zoning
 
06:10:12.590 --> 06:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
ordinance or the site plan
 
06:10:17.590 --> 06:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
regulations then um you are usually on
 
06:10:21.430 --> 06:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
Good Grounds but it's it's very
 
06:10:23.990 --> 06:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
difficult sometimes if you got one word
 
06:10:26.150 --> 06:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
wrong and this is basically what
 
06:10:27.510 --> 06:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
happened with this this other case that
 
06:10:30.510 --> 06:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
I can't talk about one word wrong and we
 
06:10:30.520 --> 06:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
I can't talk about one word wrong and we
get

06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
overruled although the tent our tent was
 
06:10:34.200 --> 06:10:36.110 align:start position:0%
overruled although the tent our tent was
quite

06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
quite
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
clear further
 
06:10:40.948 --> 06:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:10:42.590 --> 06:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony I have one more
 
06:10:51.990 --> 06:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
Rogers thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:10:57.628 --> 06:10:57.638 align:start position:0%
all for your service I come out to
 
06:11:00.150 --> 06:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
testify for things once in a while and I
 
06:11:02.910 --> 06:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
can't believe what you guys go through
 
06:11:05.030 --> 06:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the state for for the little bit of
 
06:11:07.990 --> 06:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
money you get so thank you um I'm just a
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
citizen I don't belong on any committees
 
06:11:14.510 --> 06:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
um but I'm a taxpayer and my taxes are
 
06:11:16.430 --> 06:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
getting harder and harder to pay every
 
06:11:18.628 --> 06:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
year I live in a small town of
 
06:11:20.590 --> 06:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
Winchester I'm sorry my name is William
 
06:11:22.590 --> 06:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
Rogers I live in
 
06:11:22.600 --> 06:11:24.868 align:start position:0%
Rogers I live in
Winchester

06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
Winchester
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
and my fear with I approve I I I'm in
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
favor of this this Constitutional
 
06:11:31.520 --> 06:11:33.310 align:start position:0%
favor of this this Constitutional
Amendment

06:11:33.310 --> 06:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and let me tell you
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
why we have a housing crisis in this
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
country right now we know that there's
 
06:11:44.788 --> 06:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
been millions of of people have come in
 
06:11:46.270 --> 06:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
and we know the federal government's
 
06:11:48.070 --> 06:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to want to find places for these
 
06:11:49.868 --> 06:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
people so they're going to go to the
 
06:11:52.110 --> 06:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
states the states are going to want to
 
06:11:54.468 --> 06:11:54.478 align:start position:0%
find places for these people so they're
 
06:11:56.590 --> 06:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
going to go to the towns and they're
 
06:11:57.868 --> 06:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
going to go to the
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
towns and My worry is that they go to
 
06:12:03.990 --> 06:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
the towns with a heavy hand and say you
 
06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
have to build this many houses in your
 
06:12:10.030 --> 06:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
town and because their only focus is on
 
06:12:12.750 --> 06:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
housing under a crisis which I believe
 
06:12:16.030 --> 06:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
we're in and will be in their focus is
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
on housing they're not going to take
 
06:12:22.510 --> 06:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
into consideration the schools the taxes
 
06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
the the fire engine the infrastructure
 
06:12:27.628 --> 06:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
the price the goes along with that
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
housing and representative
 
06:12:33.310 --> 06:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
priests it it's not about we don't want
 
06:12:36.868 --> 06:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
those kind of people in in our town um
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're Americans these people are here
 
06:12:41.590 --> 06:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
whether we believe they should be or not
 
06:12:43.948 --> 06:12:43.958 align:start position:0%
they're here and As Americans I believe
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to find places for them and
 
06:12:49.390 --> 06:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's important but we also have
 
06:12:52.750 --> 06:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
to think of of our taxpayers of
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves my taxes are so high I can't
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
imagine that they're going up in our
 
06:13:00.590 --> 06:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
town I know most people I want to make
 
06:13:02.830 --> 06:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
improvements to my property but I'm
 
06:13:05.070 --> 06:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
afraid to because of what it'll do to my
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
taxes and I'm worried about more
 
06:13:12.948 --> 06:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
students and forgive me but the higher
 
06:13:15.510 --> 06:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
up the chain you go I trust the federal
 
06:13:18.548 --> 06:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
government way less than i t trust the
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
state government but the people I do
 
06:13:23.190 --> 06:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
trust are the people I see on the
 
06:13:26.310 --> 06:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
streets every day in my planning board
 
06:13:28.430 --> 06:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
in my zoning board when I can go to the
 
06:13:30.830 --> 06:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
town hall and have a conversation with
 
06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
them that's important to me um we'll
 
06:13:36.230 --> 06:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
find places for these people but we
 
06:13:39.190 --> 06:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
can't we can't break our whole our whole
 
06:13:41.430 --> 06:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
towns into that and I don't believe
 
06:13:44.990 --> 06:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's any way a state can know
 
06:13:47.590 --> 06:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
whatever any any state politician can
 
06:13:50.510 --> 06:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
know every challenge that every town
 
06:13:53.350 --> 06:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
faces so it needs to be up to it should
 
06:13:55.788 --> 06:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
be up to local control during this
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
crisis because I'm afraid like I
 
06:14:01.590 --> 06:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
said we see a housing crisis we'll be
 
06:14:03.830 --> 06:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
focused on that you'll feel pressure
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
from above you're going to put pressure
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
below and I just don't think that's
 
06:14:13.310 --> 06:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
right so I'm in strong favor of this
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
amend thank you for your testimony
 
06:14:15.280 --> 06:14:18.430 align:start position:0%
amend thank you for your testimony

06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
and site plans so there what that means
 
06:14:46.590 --> 06:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
is municipalities can adopt an ordinance
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
that limits the issuance of building
 
06:14:52.190 --> 06:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
permits and put a moratorium on on
 
06:14:55.070 --> 06:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
building I would like to know has your
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
town um ever enacted or made use of that
 
06:15:01.628 --> 06:15:01.638 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox not that I'm aware
 
06:15:06.270 --> 06:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
of no um and it it sounds like it would
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
it' be an all or nothing if they put a
 
06:15:11.948 --> 06:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
moratorium on permits then
 
06:15:14.510 --> 06:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the the development that makes
 
06:15:16.468 --> 06:15:16.478 align:start position:0%
sense for our town would be under the
 
06:15:16.478 --> 06:15:17.310 align:start position:0%
sense for our town would be under the
same

06:15:17.310 --> 06:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:15:19.948 --> 06:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
moratorium as as the the development
 
06:15:22.670 --> 06:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
that would break our
 
06:15:25.990 --> 06:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
