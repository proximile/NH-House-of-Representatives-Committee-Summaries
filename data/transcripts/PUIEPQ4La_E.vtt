the agenda for the morning
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so um this morning you should have
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
received two emails from me
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
one had the typical worksheet that you
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
used to do your revenue estimates
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
an excel file and a pdf file and then a
 
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.029 align:start position:0%
an excel file and a pdf file and then a
second

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
email was where i provided you with the
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
agencies that the senate ways and means
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
has dealt with to date
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
so there was three agency documents that
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
i sent you as well as the
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
website that you can find that
 
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.909 align:start position:0%
website that you can find that
information

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that i i need to let
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know is that there is a
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
mistake on the worksheet i sent you i'm
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
going to screen share and just show you
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
so on the um worksheet there's the tab
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
this dra high low estimate so i filled
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
in the information that you're going to
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
be hearing from dra about today but i
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
failed to
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
show you the percent changes on row five
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
on the business taxes on this screenshot
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
you have right now you see it's two six
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then three five for 23.
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
um i think on the old document you have
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
the the prior numbers
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
so once we're done today i'll send out a
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
revised worksheet to
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
the committee so this is page three
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
um of the pdf file yep
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
and then the only other i mean it's the
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
typical worksheet
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
i tried to uh eliminate some rows that i
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
thought you didn't need anymore so i got
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
rid of fiscal year 2021 to help
 
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.550 align:start position:0%
rid of fiscal year 2021 to help
consolidate

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
but it left the agency information from
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
january and then
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
where the committee had agreed to
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
estimates on february 23rd
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then again on march 18th i left
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
those in the worksheet as well
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
and then um just bolded the lines of the
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
new agency estimates and then the
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee agreed to estimates this time
 
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.749 align:start position:0%
committee agreed to estimates this time
around

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then just to briefly kind of bring
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
you up to date
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
on the three agencies that have
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
senate ways and means it was liquor
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
commission lottery commission
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of securities
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission um actually came
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
in with higher revenue estimates than
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
what you see
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
on this document so the last time they
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
met with this committee it was 129
 
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
met with this committee it was 129
million

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
in um fiscal year 2021.
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
they presented the senate ways in means
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
a number of 133
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
point 1 million for fiscal year 21
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 22 they went
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
from 138 to 141.6 million
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 23 they went
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that would be in the document and
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'll populate this um
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
once we're done today the uh securities
 
00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
once we're done today the uh securities
revenue

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
had no change when they came in the
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
bureau securities uh
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
director glennon had no changes to the
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
estimates and if you're paying attention
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
to the daily revenues that are being
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
sent out
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that securities is is not
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
in yet
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
typically securities is a transfer
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's made at the end of the month
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
and sometimes what happens is you don't
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
catch that in the daily revenues
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
worksheets that get sent out to the
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
committee because it sometimes falls on
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
the very last day of the month but the
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
transaction in the system doesn't occur
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
until the first day of the next month so
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh director glennon didn't indicate
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
there were any issues with collecting
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
revenue it's just a timing issue
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
and then the only other two other things
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
is the lottery revenue
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
um the only change that charlie made was
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
that he came up in his revenue estimate
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
for uh 2021 so he's now suggesting that
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
they'll be closer to 128 million
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
and left 22 and 23 125 and 127.5
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
but i just thought it was good for the
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
committee to know that because you're
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
you had estimated 130.6
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
based on some trending that you had
 
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.710 align:start position:0%
based on some trending that you had
discussed

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so now charlie seems to be getting
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
closer to that number as well
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
and you sent these reports from these
 
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.710 align:start position:0%
and you sent these reports from these
three

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
agencies to us this morning i did i did
 
00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.310 align:start position:0%
agencies to us this morning i did i did
and and

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
i also uh provided the link where you
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
would find them in our on the website so
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
similar to where your documents are if
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
you go to our website
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see house um a link to the house
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
documents there's going to be a link to
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the senate documents as well
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
so um if you you know next monday after
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
committees meet if you want to see
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
um who presented the senate ways and
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
means and what was said you can go there
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and find that
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
for instance i didn't share with the
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee the um discussion that um
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
mr artinger had with the senate ways and
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
means this past monday
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
um but the the presentation is available
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then the only the only other piece
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to bring up was tobacco
 
00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:04.150 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to bring up was tobacco
settlement

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
you had an estimate of 38.4 million
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
based on the discussions with the
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
and if you've been looking at the daily
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
revenue you're going to see that the
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
amount that the state actually received
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
was 47.8 million
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
and um the the
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
mr sisson from the department of justice
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
is they're still looking at why the
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
number is higher but as he indicated to
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
back in january through a letter um
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the settlement is is agreed upon
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh national sales of the participating
 
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh national sales of the participating
manufacturers

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
um and then there's certain percentages
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
that each state will get re
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
as a result of that um
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a direct link to your tobacco
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
um in column c or eat if any document
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
just because your tobacco is in sales in
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are up that's not why your
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement is necessarily
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
up because it's based on the national
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
sales and it has to do with
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
participating and non-participating
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
members of the settlement agreement so i
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure to draw that link
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't just assume that because it's high
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
this year that the next two years will
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
also be high
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
there may be some trend reasons why and
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
um the doj
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
doj will be looking at that as part of
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
the work they do with the master
 
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.190 align:start position:0%
the work they do with the master
settlement

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
and you said that was 47.8 yes
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
any questions of chris on this
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
so stop share
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
so that's really all i had for the
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee um really you want to talk to
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
once if
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
once i address your questions i mean dra
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
is going to give you a good rundown of
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
what's been going on with the the
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
majority of the taxes that i think
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
are really the the uh the ones you need
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
to be concerned about
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
okay questions for chris uh
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative brownlee
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
followed by representative early and al
 
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:11.670 align:start position:0%
followed by representative early and al
almighty

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
almighty
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh chris oh thanks uh on
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
what way to the tobacco settlement um
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
such a increase this year uh
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
obviously they're looking at it you said
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh will they be joining us or will they
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
get through you
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
their their reasoning for why it was
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
high and um
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
as well as any changes that they may
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
make for next year
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
so that they're um supposed to be
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
providing a letter to senate ways and
 
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.269 align:start position:0%
providing a letter to senate ways and
means

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
on what they think will happen with the
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
um settlement going forward
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
so that i was going to use that and
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
share that with this committee instead
 
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
share that with this committee instead
of

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
making several requests requests of the
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
same individual for different committees
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not sure based on
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
conversations earlier this year when we
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
were trying to get information for your
 
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.190 align:start position:0%
were trying to get information for your
committee

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that they're going to have
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh ability to make changes to
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
what's forecasted in 22 and 23
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
because it takes time for them to go
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
through the you know the um
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
the calculation the audit that's done on
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
the calculation and then determine why
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
um the amount was what it was
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
and will that continue to trend out in
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
the next two years
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
so i think that's why i would advise at
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
this time i wouldn't make any uh
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
adjustments to um your tobacco
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
settlement numbers
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
other than 21. exactly exactly because
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's in the door that's in the bank
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representing early
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chris for taking the
 
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chris for taking the
question

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
um the governor's estimates are closer
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
to the actuals
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
than our our estimates so i'm just
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
curious did he have uh
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
information that was not available to
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
either the house or senate
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
at the time he brought his estimates
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
together is there
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know within a couple of million
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
overall estimates you're discussing yeah
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
he's 240
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
it was on the sheet you just showed
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
are you oh you're looking at uh tobacco
 
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.790 align:start position:0%
are you oh you're looking at uh tobacco
revenue

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay sorry sorry you i thought you
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
you were talking about settlement money
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm like okay that's
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the number um not necessarily no
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
no um they made estimates at a point in
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
time just as you do
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
and um as you may recall right after
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
you completed your estimates in february
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
came out with a letter with some revised
 
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
came out with a letter with some revised
estimates

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
so he he or his team thought there were
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
some changes to those estimates
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's the best that you can do at a point
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
in time so i wouldn't say that they had
 
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.590 align:start position:0%
in time so i wouldn't say that they had
anything

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
um more than what this committee had
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
um i think that you've gotten the same
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
types of information as the governor's
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
office also has
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and i think that through our office
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
and through dra
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
you get some pretty good real-time
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
information yeah we do thank uh thank
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
you i just wanted to
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone was aware of
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
timing issue um although you can't time
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
the market you can certainly time your
 
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.829 align:start position:0%
the market you can certainly time your
estimates

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
reps and help me thank you mr chairman
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
um back on the tobacco settlement itself
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
on there is an enormous amount of
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
litigation that goes
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
on on huge numbers of issues within the
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
every year keeps and they have huge
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
numbers of lawyers
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
on all sides and i'm wondering um
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
it it sounds to me like that extra money
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
is probably another of those litigations
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
having been
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
temporarily settled they settle on the
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
year at a time
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
uh often and on
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
why the department of justice doesn't
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
get a heads
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
up when when this stuff um
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
comes is going to be coming out has been
 
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.629 align:start position:0%
comes is going to be coming out has been
resolved

00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
and has been put in well i think
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the past when we've worked with the
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
department of justice around the tobacco
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
settlement they have updated the
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee when there has been resolution
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
on those outstanding issues and they've
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
also provided updates where they can
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
but as as you know they're ongoing in
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
many cases so there may be things that
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
um as attorneys and and through the
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
process they cannot share with
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
with you know outside of that process
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
until it's complete um
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
i know mr sisson's job primarily is to
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
track the
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
settlement um work with the various
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
other state attorney generals
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the audit group and the uh
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
other attorneys for the tobacco
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
companies to to monitor and make sure
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
that everybody gets their fair share on
 
00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.590 align:start position:0%
that everybody gets their fair share on
this

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so as you noted it's a fairly
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
complicated process
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
um when mr sisson can provide some
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
updated information and if it's valuable
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
enough to
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
move it forward you know we'll certainly
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
share it with the committee
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
as you know it's really right up until
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
the minute that they start to get checks
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
that can
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
when i talked to him at the beginning of
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
april to find out how much we were
 
00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.710 align:start position:0%
april to find out how much we were
getting

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
he would he he hesitated to provide a
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
number because he still wasn't sure
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
and not until the first check came
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
through the door did he
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know say yeah it looks like we're
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to get maybe this amount but
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
wait let's make sure the second check
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
gets in and it is that amount
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of things i'm not aware
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
of obviously so i i
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
again i think it's um you know we rely
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
department of justice attorneys and that
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
are assigned to the master settlement
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
agreement to provide information
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
and uh to the best of their ability
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
what makes it really complicated is that
 
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:00.230 align:start position:0%
what makes it really complicated is that
there's

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
two major issues one has to do with the
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
participating manufacturers
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
that participating manufacturers in the
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
sale their cigarettes
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
is volatile and then the
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturers
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
is also volatile and to try to
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
figure out the right percentages from
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
participating and
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
non-participating adding to adding them
 
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
non-participating adding to adding them
together

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
and they're arguing with all the
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys from both sides it makes it
 
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
attorneys from both sides it makes it
very

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
very
difficult

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
i see reps of abrami has his hand up
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
and rips okay thank you mr chair uh
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
chris i'm back to securities yep well if
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
that that last
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
payment doesn't make it by friday and
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
let's say it comes in monday or tuesday
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
but that will be treated as april
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
revenue correct
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
no it would probably show up in the uh
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
may revenue
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
it will okay it it's that's quite a it's
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
a 16.7
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh variance
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
but it so
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
what the concern is really your yearly
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
revenue i mean
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the the state divides up on
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis you know what they
 
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.110 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis you know what they
anticipate

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
receiving um but as long as the revenue
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
is trending to meet the plan that the
 
00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:24.470 align:start position:0%
is trending to meet the plan that the
state

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
the year plan i think that's the bigger
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
issue to pay attention to than whether
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
you got it in april or may
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
as long as it comes in the door if you
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't get it either day
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
or either month excuse me that's the
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
bigger concern
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
why why isn't the money coming in you
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
know it was anticipated in april we
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
didn't see it in may why
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
um but as i indicated uh director
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
glennon had had stated to the senate
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
ways and means earlier this week that
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
revenues are on track with what he's
 
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
revenues are on track with what he's
estimated

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
right so what you're saying it'll it if
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
it misses it'll probably be amazing
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
we look at the revenue focus
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and the revenue focus would note
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that okay whatever
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that in the narrative part of the the
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
revenue focus there would probably be a
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
comment that would you know basically
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
um you know due to timing you know the
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
the bounce is going to show up in the
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
next month but
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know everything came in like it
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
should have ready
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yep just our question i have
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
six million dollars was that that came
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
in extra
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that primarily from the
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturers
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know the split on um how the
 
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.549 align:start position:0%
i don't know the split on um how the
revenue

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
is attributed city uh
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
the citibank is is the uh
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
depositor of the money and and they did
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
two over two weeks why they split it the
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
way they did i don't have an answer to
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
that i'd have to uh get that from
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
but it's always been split or at least
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years i know it's
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
been in over two payments that they've
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
done that i don't know why though
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um with attack excuse me
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
with the tax
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
being delayed another month how is that
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
going to affect the ind
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in is or is it going to
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
another month although taxes are
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paid by last week
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
right so so the delay is a it's on the
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
federal return
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
for an individual the new hampshire new
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire didn't delay its return so you
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
should have paid your taxes on time
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
but i would defer or would ask you to
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
allow dra to respond to that they would
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
have a better sense but i
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think the the answer i can give you is
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there's been a delay
 
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.430 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there's been a delay
or

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of the federal government
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
pushing it out a month
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um back to the tobacco
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
settlement the
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
third thing that on i think still
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
varies is that uh there are penalties
 
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
varies is that uh there are penalties
for

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
states that don't do sufficient
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement against
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
illegal cigarettes and um
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
there are places like new york where
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
illegal cigarettes are all over the
 
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
illegal cigarettes are all over the
place

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
on and when they lose money because of
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
because of that do the rest of us gain
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
in that formula or is that a
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
it just stays in a reserve fund or goes
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so i don't know a direct
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
answer to that question reps of only but
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the letter that mr sisson provided
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
back in january
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
21st 2021 he made he
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the middle paragraph he says the
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
payments there's three things that
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
can have an impact on your payments the
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
payments are adjusted upwards at an
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
agreed rate of inflation
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
the the payments are adjusted downward
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
based on decreases in the national
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
market for cigarettes
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
and downward again to reflect the
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
markets movement away from the premium
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
brand cigarettes towards discounted
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh non-participating uh manufacturers
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
who have not joined the msa
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
so those were the three things that in
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
january that mr assistant identified
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
would have a potential
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
impact on how you calculate what amount
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
comes into the state
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how the enforcement
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
do we have an issue on
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me do we have another
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
issue dealing with other revenues that
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
you want to ask chris about
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
if if no one does represent major i did
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
have one thing i forgot to mention about
 
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.269 align:start position:0%
have one thing i forgot to mention about
liquor

00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
okay um so though they've
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
estimated an increase as you may recall
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
when they came in
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
um during their time with the house ways
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
and means committee they
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
indicated they had to pay out an extra
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
8.2 million dollars to
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire grant and advantage based
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
on rsa 126
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
dash aaa colon 3 so that statute allows
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
for the department of health and human
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
services if they're having a shortfall
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the in that fund to request liquor
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
commission make a transfer to it
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
and at that time there was no indication
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
that there would be another one in
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year uh 21. however
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of march the department of
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
health and human services did reach out
 
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.269 align:start position:0%
health and human services did reach out
to

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
liquor commission and indicated in the
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
next six month period so that would be
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
um the last three months of 21 and then
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
the first three months of fiscal year 22
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
they potentially may need another
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
transfer from the liquor commission
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
of an amount less than 8.2 million but
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
they don't know the amount yet
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i've um trying to work with health
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and human services to see if we can get
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
some information related to that
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um but i just wanted to make you aware
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
there may be another hit to the to the
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
liquor commission revenue and i just
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's going to be
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
um in 21 or 22 yet i kind of think it's
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to probably come into
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
22 unless they do something quickly when
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
did that start
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
what year did that start right this is
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
the first year that this is occurring i
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
think it was in legislation past last
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
year that they
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
um that the language was adjusted to
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
allow for this to occur
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
and the first time you saw an impact was
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh in january
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
february time frame when when uh liquor
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
commission came in and indicated they
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
had to make that transfer a way of
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
pushing

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
reps of almighty has their hand done
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think that that was in the
 
00:25:58.159 --> 00:25:58.789 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think that that was in the
final

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
budget to to have a safety valve if
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
there was going to be
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
more um more medicaid expenses
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
than they'd budgeted for
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
that it was going to come out of liquor
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't find it particularly lovely but
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
it was something that that made sense to
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation could have come out
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think it was in the budget itself
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
and it didn't show up until recently
 
00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:30.630 align:start position:0%
and it didn't show up until recently
because

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
they were going through the money that
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%

doing
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
doing the same presentation however
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
today we are doing revenue estimates
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
through march we're going to be talking
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
about or i'm going to be talking about
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
our major taxes
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
business profits tax business enterprise
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
tax meals and rentals tax tobacco tax
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
communications services tax real estate
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
transfer tax and utility property tax
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
we have in the chart below our fiscal
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
revised estimates these are
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
net of the anomalous receivable i think
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
at this point the committee's
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with that and we know we
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
need to uh remove those
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivables so we can have a
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
nice solid base to grow
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 off from and then
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
we will also be presenting revised
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 growth ranges in the
 
00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:29.669 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 growth ranges in the
chart

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
you will see under business taxes and
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax we have
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
tbd to be determined uh as you know
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
right now we are in the middle of
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
or getting close to the end of the bulk
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
of the revenue coming in for those taxes
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're receiving uh returns right now for
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
covid periods
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
and we really wanted to make sure we got
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
all of that revenue
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
in those tax return process so we could
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
do a deeper dive and
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
really understand what's going on and
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
why the revenues are so high
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
for business taxes this month and i
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
believe we'll be coming back
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
in may to give you um updated
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
estimates on those taxes uh which would
 
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
estimates on those taxes uh which would
include

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
march and april we're looking forward to
 
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
march and april we're looking forward to
that

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
great us as well us as well
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
um also on this page i just want to draw
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
your attention to what you're pretty
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
um some taxes have fared pretty well
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic as you can see that
 
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic as you can see that
with

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax at 22 um
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
we have real estate transfer tax at 30
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan and then other taxes have
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
not fared as well
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
and as you know meals and rentals tax
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
has been one of the hardest hit taxes
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic at a loss of 17
 
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic at a loss of 17
percent

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%

00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
um effects on kovid 19 for the business
 
00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
um effects on kovid 19 for the business
tax

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that now in our march and
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
april returns so what's due in march and
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
april are calendar year filers
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
for calendar year 2020. um
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
so this will be again will be
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
interesting to see how these
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
pan out and what they look like once
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
everything is posted
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
i do want to note though that we may
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
have an increase in extension payments
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
that are happening this year
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
and we won't get actual data on those
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
returns for extension payments for seven
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
months so in the fall we will get
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
the full picture for calendar year
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
filers of what's what
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2020 on these these
 
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.110 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2020 on these these
returns

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
returns
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
another thing that we thought was
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
important to consider is that
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh this session we have had the largest
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
stimulus package the federal government
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
has ever
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
infused into the economy it's just less
 
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.470 align:start position:0%
infused into the economy it's just less
than

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
25 of the 2019 gdp
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
which is incredibly incredibly large and
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
we really
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
think that those large stimulus packages
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
have really
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
helped carry businesses along it has
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
helped individuals
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
with consumer spending and helping
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
what's in their bank accounts
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
and it's just really something to keep
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
in mind as to why we may be ahead so far
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
and lastly we just wanted to know
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates obviously those have
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
fluctuated as well as just
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
how the economy is performing in in
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
general is definitely tied to how
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
business taxes are performing
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
in the second column in in the next
 
00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:56.630 align:start position:0%
in the second column in in the next
chart

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
we show fiscal year to date for business
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
taxes we're 561.6 million dollars of
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
revenue in so far and that's 17.2
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan and then for our fiscal
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
year 22 ranges i believe we did adjust
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
these some from when we were last here
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
we expanded a bit we now have a range of
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
two to six percent uh for fiscal year 22
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
and three to five percent for fiscal
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
year 23.
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
these growth ranges are based on
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
predicted gdp
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
um it varies on which sites you look at
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh the average right now we've seen is
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
around five percent but it is lower on
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
some sites and higher on
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
other sites and then what we have heard
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
across the board is that they do
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate the gdp to slow during fiscal
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
year 23
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
to around four percent again that can
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
vary some depending on the websites but
 
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:52.910 align:start position:0%
that is encompassed in our range
 
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.269 align:start position:0%
that is encompassed in our range
[Music]

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
any questions on business taxes through
 
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
any questions on business taxes through

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually norm i i can't find my button
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay what representative broadway yeah i
 
00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:12.389 align:start position:0%
okay what representative broadway yeah i
think

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know when you want to have this
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
discussion uh mr chair about uh
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
how we want to how we want to project
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
for future years i guess it depends on
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
whether we pass
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
sb3 or not um
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
if we if we do then
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's some of this revenue and i know
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
dra is going to be working on this
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
we have to try to best estimate how much
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the revenue from this year is really
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
i guess anomalous uh that is going to
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
have to be given back in the next two
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.550 align:start position:0%
have to be given back in the next two
years

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
so uh so is the strategy to continue to
 
00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:48.790 align:start position:0%
so uh so is the strategy to continue to
predict

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
predict
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
revenues as they offer 21
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
without any modification
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then we have a
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
how much of that would be an anomalous
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
like we have in the past
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we can pass along to the senate and
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
others that don't don't spend this money
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
because we're giving some of it back so
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's my only concern going forward as
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
to how we're going to handle that
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
and yeah we can have that discussion now
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
or later but
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think we need to have that discussion
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's my big concern
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm not in a hurry on senate
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill 3.
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work to do on senate
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill 3 to try to identify
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
how much of that excess
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes is associated with
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
the stimulus funds that are out there
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then how much is is it going to
 
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.069 align:start position:0%
and then how much is is it going to
fluctuate

00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
fluctuate
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
do if we pass senate bill 3 as
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
is because under current law
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
they don't get a credit for that because
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
if they use
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
the stimulus funds for what it was
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
intended to they're not going to get
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
taxed on it anyway
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
so we need to number one find out
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
how much is it going to affect our
 
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.069 align:start position:0%
how much is it going to affect our
revenues

00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
if we pass senate bill 3 as is
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to have to make a
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
determination do we want to do that or
 
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.630 align:start position:0%
determination do we want to do that or
not

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
so that's why i figure that's going to
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
take us a while and we're going to
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
stretch it right out to the end
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
to to the point where we have to make a
 
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.430 align:start position:0%
to to the point where we have to make a
determination

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
of what we estimate the revenues are
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be our most difficult task
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
sounds good also something that's going
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
to affect
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
revenues is whether or not
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
um house bill 2 goes
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
through as is is
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
if house bill 2 or if the budget goes
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
through as
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
is and if it looks like that
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
then we know what those numbers would be
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
but if not then we would have to make
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
adjustments on that
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
at least tell them what the effect would
 
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.550 align:start position:0%
at least tell them what the effect would
be

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of work to do
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
especially with the business taxes
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
understanding how much of that is
 
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.030 align:start position:0%
understanding how much of that is
associated

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
associated
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
with the stimulus how much of that is
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh forgiving
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the forgiving the loans
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to being able to writing it
 
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
in addition to being able to writing it
off

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
so i hope that answers that question
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
sure does thank you representative
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to ask
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
melissa or
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
carolyn maybe on when they think
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
with how much more information do they
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
think that they will have about
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
these issues by the 26th of may
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
which is the last date we can get it to
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
i can start with that and if carolyn
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
wants to supplement um
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
feel free um so right now like i said
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
returns are coming in for calendar year
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
filers so i think
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
um by the beginning or mid-may
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to look at these taxpayers
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
filed um it's honest it's called a
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
schedule for so we have a separate line
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
item on a schedule for these ppp
 
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.990 align:start position:0%
item on a schedule for these ppp
information

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
so at least for the taxpayers that are
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
actually filing returns in march and
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
april and have reported
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
that ppp information we will be able to
 
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.470 align:start position:0%
that ppp information we will be able to
have

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
if i could on i think that we were told
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday that
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh by by uh
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
carolyn i think unknown by lindsay that
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
on a lot of the businesses
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
are likely that got ppp loans
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
may be filing extensions so
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to look at their
 
00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.510 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to look at their
information

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a fair statement i
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
did take a peek yesterday at extensions
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
to see what the counts were looking
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
looking like and return counts were down
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
and extension counts were up
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
so um as commissioner sepp did say
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday i think that
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
is fair that again we can analyze what
 
00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:36.550 align:start position:0%
is fair that again we can analyze what
has

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
i could jump in on this is that the
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
filing of the taxes for april
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
in may march and april is primarily due
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
to the tax year
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
2020 and tax year 2020
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
is our concern on the first stimulus
 
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.109 align:start position:0%
is our concern on the first stimulus
package

00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
package
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
which had the ppp loans the second
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
set of ppp loans was not authorized
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
until january of this year
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
and so for tax year 21
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
we will see that effect
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
in what's filed in march in april of
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
2022 so we're going to go through the
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
whole process again for that and
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
so um i know that the dra
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
came up with about 91 million dollars in
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
total effect
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
but we need to be able to understand how
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
much of that is due to the first
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
stimulus package
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
and how much the second stimulus package
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
can contribute to that that's just one
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
part of the pie the other part of the
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
pie is
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
and and i'm trying to get somebody from
 
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.109 align:start position:0%
and and i'm trying to get somebody from
treasury

00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
who understands what's happening in
 
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.230 align:start position:0%
who understands what's happening in
treasury

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
to let us know how
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
this stimulus package this
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
huge stimulus package has been passed
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
but the rules haven't been written yet
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
is how can we use that
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
funds if we can use that funds for
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
the first stimulus
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
ppp loans to be forgiven so they get
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
double benefits
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
to backfill that we have to make a
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
decision on that
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
but we we can't even discuss that until
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
we know what the rules are
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid there's going to be a lot on
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
sensei afraid
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be aware of what the rules
 
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.030 align:start position:0%
we need to be aware of what the rules
are

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
and that 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
package and
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i know there's a bunch of states
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
that are telling the federal government
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
you can't do what you said initially is
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
that you can't
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
back till you know or change your tax
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
rates because of this
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
you have anything to add on melissa
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
i think everything that you said um is
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
definitely accurate
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
are 22 and 23 estimates just to the
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
growth ranges are based on current law
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe if sb3 is passed it does
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
go into the surplus statement as a
 
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
go into the surplus statement as a
reduction

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
um for future years
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
we need to understand this so that we
 
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
we need to understand this so that we
can

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
warn the rest of our colleagues
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
that this money isn't out there to be
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
spent right away
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
because if we spend
 
00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
because if we spend
it

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
and and then the
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
refunds are going to be asked for
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
after all the the extensions are
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
completed in the fall and we'd have to
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
give that money back
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
so we spent money we didn't really have
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
mr chairman but i was asking about the
 
00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:33.430 align:start position:0%
mr chairman but i was asking about the
20

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh fy20 results that were
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
were are in um
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
fy 21 at this point which
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
is uh how many of those were actually
 
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.670 align:start position:0%
is uh how many of those were actually
forgiven

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
we don't know and probably a lot of them
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
are going to be an
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
extension so we won't know till the fall
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
whether they were
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
were went into 21 or they're going into
 
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
were went into 21 or they're going into
22.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
represent a tucker yes i
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
i wondered whether you could comment uh
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
miss rollins on
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
number the fourth listed as a factor
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
largest stimulus packages the federal
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
government probably should say as
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
yet has ever infused into the economy
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
have you done a sort of a
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
a little study of what would have
 
00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
a little study of what would have
happened

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
to our businesses here in new hampshire
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
with 500 or fewer employees
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
if we hadn't had the packages
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
somehow i think that it would give us a
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
different feeling
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
about sb3 if we understood what
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
we would be dealing with in the way of
 
00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.270 align:start position:0%
we would be dealing with in the way of
revenues

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
has the department had a moment to think
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question representative
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
tucker we um
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
have not done any implicit
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
analysis on these federal stimulus
 
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.910 align:start position:0%
analysis on these federal stimulus
packages

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
packages
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we have attended quite a few
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
webinars on
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
how these federal stimulus funds have
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
affected businesses and the positive
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
impacts that it has on affecting
 
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
impacts that it has on affecting
businesses

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a wide variety right it's
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
not just businesses it's as well
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
as individuals receiving these payments
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
increasing individual payments
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
um through the stimulus fund also
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
increases consumer spending
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
which then helps businesses so it's not
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
always just a direct correlation to
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
businesses receiving funds from the
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
federal government it's also
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
ties to individuals and their spending
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
habits based on the extra funds that
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
they have available to them with this
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
this money so um we haven't done an
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
exact correlation to it
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
but we do exact yep but we do
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
know that um we have heard from other
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
state agencies that revenues are up as
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
well it's obviously
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
surprising compared to where we were
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
back june of last year when we were
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
doing revenue estimates
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
and anticipating a large loss to where
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
now um and a big factor
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
is i think what the federal government's
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
plan was was to infuse the economy
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
with a large amount of funds to keep it
 
00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:38.550 align:start position:0%
with a large amount of funds to keep it
whole

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
and not to to dip into a recession
 
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.670 align:start position:0%
and not to to dip into a recession
situation

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i do believe that if we could have
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
some maybe the fiscal institute
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
or uh the unh
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
could come up with some kind of
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we would be facing
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
in the way of
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
vastly reduced revenues if we hadn't had
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government infusing that
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
money and i think it changes
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
the view a little on sb3 to really
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
and you know it really was a partnership
 
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.230 align:start position:0%
and you know it really was a partnership
between

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government the state and
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
these individuals and businesses and it
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
good to have some clearer picture
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's quantitative to understand that
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
because i think it will change i
 
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.150 align:start position:0%
because i think it will change i
understand

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
why the senate voted 23 to zip
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
on their recommendation on that bill
 
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.270 align:start position:0%
on their recommendation on that bill
and

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
i think it changes the view of it to
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
grasp it
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
so anything that you can come up with i
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's the names thank you um
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
yeah instead of getting back to the
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
immediate estimating
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
question that we are struggling with um
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's clear to me and i'm sure to
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of us that
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh that we really
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
lack information now we're going to have
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
more information after dra does that
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
deep dive
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's been talked about into the
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
information that is coming in
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
this month with regard to that
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
i wonder um with regard to the piece of
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
it that involves
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
extension payments where i know that
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
what the ra
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
receives is not not
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
not much more than a number a bottom
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
line number
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh in other words the amount that the
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
the entity has decided they need to pay
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
but they don't give any detail on it i
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
if dra could in some way
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
do a a questionnaire a poll of some kind
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
a sample sample a set of questions
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
to payers of extension payments
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
that directly asks about this ppp
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
question and allows us to
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
dig into that part of the revenue that
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
is pouring in right now
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna bounce that over to assistant
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean we've i forget now
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
the context but we've done
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
questionnaires in the past from the
 
00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
questionnaires in the past from the
department

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
sort of optional questionnaires and
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
haven't had the greatest success in
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
getting responses
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if a more efficient way to
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
get answers
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be to work through the cpas
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
that are filing the returns
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
and ask them um whether what their
 
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.470 align:start position:0%
and ask them um whether what their
clients

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
clients
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
have been doing um and i can
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
i can get with commissioner steph and
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
find out whether
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that we'd be
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable initiating or
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
get um you folks in touch with the um
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
ceo of the cpa society um
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
to do that directly very great
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
if it's from you as opposed to us
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
because our
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
purposes are slightly different
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes yeah
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
i understand that right so that would be
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
great to
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
try to figure that out and if we need to
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
do something
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sure chairman major would be
 
00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:53.990 align:start position:0%
i'm sure chairman major would be
interested

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
in knowing what that is and deciding
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
you make a good point and it reinforces
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
what i learned last weekend when
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
my accountant told me uh
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
because has to
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
submit their tax returns based on
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
and it'd be nice to find out from the
 
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:29.670 align:start position:0%
and it'd be nice to find out from the
accountants

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
accountants
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
as is that about how much
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of percentage of their taxes
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
that they're paying
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
is associated with
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
the pvp loans and they'll give us more
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
information whether it's
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i i hope that the dra
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
does it separately and i'm going to see
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of not knowledgeable
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
cpas that come in before the committee
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
represent almighty thank you
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
i think i think this is a great idea and
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
if we went
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
through the cpa society on
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
and gave them some time to to ask their
 
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.270 align:start position:0%
and gave them some time to to ask their
membership

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
on maybe we could get some kind of
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
structure on it about on
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
the businesses that are uh
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
generally reporting over
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars of uh
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
profit versus the ones that are are
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
generally reporting
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh under 500 000 or less
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
so that we could sort of look at that
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
together with the triangle
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
right and we're going to have to
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
we want to get cpas that are give us the
 
00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
we want to get cpas that are give us the
uh

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
that aren't strictly lobbyists
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
um but looking at us what the real story
 
00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:23.990 align:start position:0%
um but looking at us what the real story
is

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's why i think that the cpa society
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
would would give us a broader range of
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
cpas i think that that at least a lot of
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
the small
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
small ones as well as the big ones
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
belong to that
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
good point
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions uh if
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
not then melissa can continue
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to move on to the
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so meals and rentals tax
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
we have the historical breakdown up top
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
just for reference
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
80 meals 17 room three percent motor
 
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.190 align:start position:0%
80 meals 17 room three percent motor
vehicle

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle um so again like i said meals
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax has been
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
the hardest hit tax during the pandemic
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date through march it's
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
61.7 million
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
or 20.8 percent below plan
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
and 45.9 million or 16.3 percent below
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
this does include a 1.6 million dollar
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
however some things to factor we know
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
things are changing out there we have
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
the covid19
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine distribution is occurring as
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
well as some
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
increased consumer confidence we have
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
lifted travel restrictions
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
so i think we're going to start seeing a
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
change on this recovery rate as we start
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
to come out of the pandemic
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 low
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
we have 315.4 million
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
which is 18 below plan so obviously
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're 20.8 currently so this assumes a
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
gradual improvement during these last
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
few months of the fiscal year
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
and we're basing that on consumer
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
confidence growing
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
people ready to get out based on the
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
winter as well as
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
these continued outdoor dining options
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
that we did see
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
um start to happen at the
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
spring of last year but have now even
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
expanded further
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
this year and then our high is ending
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
17 below plan or 320.4 million
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
this assumes a faster improvement for
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
the last few months
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
um with that consumer confidence coupled
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
with travel restrictions being lifted
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then consumers just trying to get
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
back to normal
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 22 range is 5 to 10
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
percent growth over 21 base
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
our low is equal to fiscal year 18 m r
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
revenue and our high is equal to around
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
19 fiscal year 19 m r revenue compared
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
to 21
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then 23 we have
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
m and r going back to normal as you know
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
those who have been around for a while
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
the historical growth
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
growth rate for m r is typically around
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
five percent year over year
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
so we have this four to six percent that
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
um depending on where 22 lands
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
gets us back into our normal range for
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on this
 
00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on this
tax

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.309 align:start position:0%
tax
representative

00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder um the meals part
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
also includes a lot of prepackaged meals
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh from typical grocery stores i
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that because
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
my store you know i was selling uh
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
little packages of wings and things that
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
are all prepared
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it does seem like that's been very
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
popular so i didn't know that was
 
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.230 align:start position:0%
popular so i didn't know that was
anything

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you had noticed or if that really
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
is a big percent of the meals tax
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't think we necessarily we have a
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
breakdown on grocery stores and we could
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
look to see what the growth rate changes
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
there because not everything in the
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
grocery store is taxable but as you
 
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.510 align:start position:0%
grocery store is taxable but as you
mentioned

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
um representative southwest those items
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
are taxable
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really good point i
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
brought it up in the past and it's not
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily on this slide but
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
we have seen a pretty interesting shift
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
in meals and rentals tax
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
where um operators have been pretty
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
creative to maintain
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
some status quo or even just to get
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
and they've done that like you said more
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
takeout options um
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
they've expanded like we said to outdoor
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
dining we have more people staying at
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
airbnbs versus hotels um and just
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of creativity through the this um
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
industry to sort of keep them up and
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
running so i wouldn't be surprised if we
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
did see an increase in those type of
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
prepared meals
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
um bringing in revenue you're welcome
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you for taking
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of uh news and rooms tax
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
the airbnb type short-term rentals
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
what percent of that uh is it and
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
let me just open i'm not sure if i have
 
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.109 align:start position:0%
let me just open i'm not sure if i have
a

00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
total percent
 
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:34.829 align:start position:0%
total percent
[Music]

00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:36.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
don't think i have a total percent but
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
we can we can get that for you
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
it's essentially our rental agents and i
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
will look um
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
we can get back to us in that in an
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
email of how much they make up
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
as the whole yeah that bread and
 
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.390 align:start position:0%
as the whole yeah that bread and
breakfast

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
and uh rental agents type stuff is that
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
would that
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh be the area sure we have two we
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
have those
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
categorized in two separate um
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
categories so i think i can give those
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
to you individually as a whole as well
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
all right the only reason i ask that is
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
because apparently some of the resort
 
00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
because apparently some of the resort
areas

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
are banning uh short-term rentals
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:19.349 align:start position:0%
 
interesting

00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
i wonder what the effect on revenues
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be by that
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we um it would be curious to see
 
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.030 align:start position:0%
yeah we um it would be curious to see
that

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
i i do know that rental agents um
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
rental agents have been performing well
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
ahead of prior year whereas hotels have
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
been taking a loss compared to
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
last year um and my nice colleague devon
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
rodrick has
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
let me know that rental agents make up
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
3.9 percent of total revenue
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you know state law allows
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
towns to limit short-term
 
00:59:58.839 --> 01:00:03.030 align:start position:0%
towns to limit short-term
rentals

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh carolyn do you know that information
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the answer to that
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
question whether local zoning
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
laws would permit um outlawing
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh short-term rentals i suspect what
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
local towns would rely upon is that
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
um short-term rentals
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
might constitute a business as opposed
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
to a uh
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
residential use of property um and i
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
think a town's ability to
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
regulate business versus residential use
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
is pretty well established
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you just to add to that i think on
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
you you and patrick and i have been with
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
the city of portsmouth
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
in uh summer studies in which they were
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
doing that and having done that i think
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
but um i wanted to
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
ask about something that's been worrying
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
me looking at
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh we seem as a state through
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the newspapers at least to be
 
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.230 align:start position:0%
in the newspapers at least to be
advertising

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh the state as a place you can come
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
without a mask without a vaccination and
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
party and if
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
we get another major outbreak of that
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
sort we're going to
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
be be uh discouraging
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
all of the people that would love to
 
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
all of the people that would love to
travel

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
but don't uh don't want to take risks
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
of that sort and i don't know how
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
we could get a handle on
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
on whether this could be a problem for
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
the future or not
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
but on we are advertising ourselves as
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
as the the place to come for freedom in
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
new england
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
at this point not specifically through
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
the bea i don't think but
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh through all of the stuff that i
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
see in the media printed and social
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's a statement right
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
if not melissa can go on to the next tax
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
all right our next tax is tobacco tax um
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
again we just have a break
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of the taxes 92 percent
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
um is of the revenue is cigarette stamps
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
and eight percent is other tobacco
 
01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:46.390 align:start position:0%
and eight percent is other tobacco
product

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
this tax has been performing well um
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
we've spoke a lot about this tax in pre
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
previous presentations fiscal year to
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
date through march were 32.7 million or
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
21.8 percent ahead of plan
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
and 31.6 million or 20.9 percent ahead
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
of prior year
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
again as we've stated several times the
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts ban on mentally aided
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco and other flavor tobacco
 
01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
tobacco and other flavor tobacco
products

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
has been a real windfall for the state
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we've heard this anecdotally from
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
other states saying they as well
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
have seen um an increase in their sales
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
based on the massachusetts band
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
we have sort of a tighter range here as
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
we're ending the fiscal year
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
we have 240.2 million for our
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
for our low that's 19 ahead of plan
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
that's assuming sort of all things
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
continue as usual
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
and then for our highest 245.1
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's 22 ahead of plan and again that's
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
continued with this massachusetts flavor
 
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.029 align:start position:0%
continued with this massachusetts flavor
band

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
band
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
and then potentially some increased
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales due to uh consumer
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
confidence and travel restrictions
 
01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.430 align:start position:0%
confidence and travel restrictions
lifted

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
lifted
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
for our 22 growth ranges we have a
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
negative three percent
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
three percent to zero percent for 22
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
um this is based on historical
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
year-over-year reductions
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then we've tempered this and
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for any residual offset by
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes and the massachusetts
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
flavor band
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 23 we have a
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
negative four percent to negative one
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
percent um
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
which is a loss consistent with
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
historical trends
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh just one other thing i wanted to add
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
on this tax is
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
once we do end fiscal year 21 we will
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a full year of the massachusetts
 
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.069 align:start position:0%
have a full year of the massachusetts
mentholated

01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
mentholated
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
band products as well as flavored otp
 
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
band products as well as flavored otp
products

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
in our revenues which is why you don't
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
see that continued
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
increase in 22 because again it's one
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
full year
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
of encompassing it and we assume that
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
will be our new base at that point
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions on this tax
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
before we get to questions
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
melissa in congress right now
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
is a law to ban
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
mental cigarettes nationwide and that's
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
active in congress right now if that
 
01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
active in congress right now if that
passes

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
then that would give us a step function
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
loss in that tobacco revenues you have
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
any idea how much that would be
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
if it passes and it's in fact 1
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
1 22 then it would certainly affect our
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 estimates yes thank you
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative major for the question
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct if a band of
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
mentated products
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
or flavored otb products was federally
 
01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:40.630 align:start position:0%
or flavored otb products was federally
banded

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
banded
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
we would see a pretty decent decrease in
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
our revenues especially since we've had
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
this bump up in 21
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
for more cross-border sales due to these
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
products we don't necessarily
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
have a number tied to that because on
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
our reporting
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
a stamp is a stamp they purchase stamps
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
with us it doesn't matter the type of
 
01:05:57.039 --> 01:05:57.589 align:start position:0%
with us it doesn't matter the type of
product

01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
they're buying um and this is same with
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
otp when they're filing the return it
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't break out the type of
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
product whether it's mentholated or not
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's more in sub categories
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
however we have reached out and we do
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
have anecdotal evidence that
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
our increase in what wholesalers and
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
retailers are seeing
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
is a pretty massive increase um on the
 
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
is a pretty massive increase um on the
border

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
border
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
the border towns based on this
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
mentholated ban
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
so again if if we did see that pass in
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government which i do think
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
has come up a couple of times and hasn't
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
made it through
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
if we do see it we will see a reduction
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
in our tobacco tax revenue
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative rodney
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um melissa
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
i think i brought this up a couple of
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
months ago which
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
i guess we need to keep an eye on what
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts may do
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of any legislation to
 
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.710 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of any legislation to
rescind

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
rescind
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
this this span on unmenthol cigarettes
 
01:06:59.599 --> 01:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
this this span on unmenthol cigarettes
because

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
they may miss the revenue um
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think there were a couple of bills but
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe within a month we should
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
take another look at that before we
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
finalize our revenues to see if
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
if there's any action on those bills
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's more of a statement than i
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
guess a question i just
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
yeah we do get some information on
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
other states and legislation i haven't
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
seen anything updated on massachusetts
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
thus far i do know
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
that connecticut um does have a bill out
 
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.230 align:start position:0%
that connecticut um does have a bill out
there

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
banning mentally to products and
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
flavored products so that's one we were
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
but i haven't seen anything updated for
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts yet but
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
you're accurate it's something that um
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
should definitely keep an eye on
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you rexella
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you on can you look at the last 12
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
months since
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
or rf fy 20 and see
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
oh oh that is the fy 20 breakdown that
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
eight percent is other
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so it's still
 
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.190 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so it's still
maintaining

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
the history the breakdown we've been at
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes it has definitely year over year
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
grown by it's still a small percent
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
obviously but
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
if we have it on our dry dry website the
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
historical breakdown
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
for these taxes and otp every year has
 
01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.030 align:start position:0%
for these taxes and otp every year has
been

01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
gaining um by a percentage or two
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
compared to the total but that is a
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 breakdown
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so that the pandemic didn't really
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
affect that
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
and we have an e-cig breakdown i mean
 
01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:46.229 align:start position:0%
and we have an e-cig breakdown i mean
it's

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of money but it's
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
more tobacco
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
than the money yeah i think and i'm
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
going off the top of my head i think it
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
was around
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
three million fiscal year to date so far
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
um 20 revenues for e-cigarettes
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
out of the anticipated 240 to 245
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
million so
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
small percentage so far and again
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
we do list that in our monthly um
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco reports that we send out
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions to ask melissa on
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see any so melissa you can go on
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
to the next
 
01:09:29.199 --> 01:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
to the next
text

01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
all right so interest and dividends tax
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
just like business tax i'll give you an
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
update um where we're at through
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
march with um fiscal year 21
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
to be determined uh fiscal year to date
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
through march we were 19.1 million or
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
35 35.9 ahead of plan and 21.3 million
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
or 41.8 percent ahead of prior year
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
again this includes the 9.2 million
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
of anomalous receivable as you know this
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
tax does have historical year-over-year
 
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
tax does have historical year-over-year
swings

01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
swings
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
it is interest and dividends tax so when
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the stock market is
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
performing well this helps in this tax
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
helps in this task
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
we know that more people have money in
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
the bank
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
again we talked about the federal
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
stimulus fund this that
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
does play into this for individuals um
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
and this tax appears to be unaffected by
 
01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.070 align:start position:0%
and this tax appears to be unaffected by
covid19

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
covid19
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
of course we'll we'll see if that
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
statement rings true
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably towards the end of may because
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
as you had brought up i forgot which rep
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
brought it up but chris
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
also addressed it the irs did extend
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
their due date for individuals
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
to file and pay their returns to may
 
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.189 align:start position:0%
to file and pay their returns to may
17th

01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
17th
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
however new hampshire remains april 15th
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
but we do know that as we keep talking
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
about this anomalous receivable
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
we do know that last year the federal
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
government also extended their due date
 
01:10:57.679 --> 01:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
government also extended their due date
to

01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
july where new hampshire extended it to
 
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
july where new hampshire extended it to
june

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
june
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we still did get a fair amount of
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
money and returns filed in july based on
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
the federal due date
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
so i think as of right now interest and
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is down
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
um but before we can jump the gun and
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
say it's down and it's trued up payments
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
i do think we need to see what happens
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
in may
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year to date for fiscal year
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
21 were 63.1
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
million or 18.6 percent ahead of plan
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the anomalous receivable removed
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
for our growth ranges for 22 we have
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
four to six percent this is based on
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
past performance of the tax coupled with
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated gdp
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
and then in 23 we have a two to four
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
percent growth range
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
this is a slowing of the growth based on
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
past performance
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
as well as anticipated reduction of gdp
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
in that 23 period happy to answer any
 
01:11:52.159 --> 01:11:53.270 align:start position:0%
in that 23 period happy to answer any
questions

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative army followed by
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative southwest
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think representative southwest was
 
01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
i think representative southwest was
first

01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay representation uh thank you
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
just for clarification if this tax
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
is reduced and repealed will that go in
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
the surplus
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
statement so this will be in the front
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the budget as if it was really going
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
and then the surplus station will will
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct right here is based on
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
current law if that does pass then
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
surplus statement will have that
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
reduction of revenue for um
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
22 and 23. so people really need to
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
have the surplus state statement next to
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
the budget so to speak
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
to really understand some of the changes
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's an accurate
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
statement your end revenue is your
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
revenues your projected revenues minus
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
your surplus state minus or plus your
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
surplus statement items
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
can you check on now
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh or right after april is finished
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
how how many how much refunds we're
 
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.550 align:start position:0%
how how many how much refunds we're
getting

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
in requests we're getting in this or how
 
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.390 align:start position:0%
in requests we're getting in this or how
much

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
better how much overpayment of
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
last year's tax is showing up
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
this year yeah sure um we get reports on
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
that and we can see what it looks like
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
once all these returns are in and
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
processed for april
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
as of right now i don't think there's
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
anything sitting out there that's
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
glaring that it's going to be any
 
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
glaring that it's going to be any
massive

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
massive
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
refunds but we'll definitely take a look
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
once everything's processed and let you
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
know if that will have a major impact or
 
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.550 align:start position:0%
know if that will have a major impact or
not

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any further questions on
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
saying none we'll say you can go on to
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
all right communication services tax uh
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date through march where
 
01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:00.870 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date through march where
um

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
negative 300 000 or one percent below
 
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
negative 300 000 or one percent below
plan

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
and um 400 000
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
or 1.4 percent ahead of prior year
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
as you know this tax um unemployment
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
rates can affect this tax
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
it might um affect a taxpayer's or
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me a uh well a taxpayer's ability
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
to pay this tax which was then result in
 
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
to pay this tax which was then result in
a

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
reduced cst tax also we have the
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
taxability of voip conferencing and
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
increased use of product
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
for the taxability video conferencing
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
just to um
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
let you know that we are still looking
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
into that it's definitely on our list
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
we had said we were going to do an audit
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
and look at these taxpayers to make sure
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
they are paying tax and that is still is
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
an ongoing process for fiscal year 21 we
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a range on this tax because
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't vary
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
a lot we have 39.1 million that's
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
landing us two percent below plan and
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's a loss of two percent for the
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
remaining months of the year
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
and then we have it flat for 22 and 23.
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
again we normally see a decrease in this
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
tax we're starting to feel like we are
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
at the low point with this tax and then
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
any offset
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
being brought in by um the taxability of
 
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.310 align:start position:0%
being brought in by um the taxability of
the

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
video conferencing would net that out to
 
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.669 align:start position:0%
video conferencing would net that out to
zero

01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members on
 
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.310 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members on
cst

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
cst
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
are you any closer to being able to tell
 
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:38.630 align:start position:0%
are you any closer to being able to tell
us

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
how you what you would tax in the
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh zoom calls the video conferencing
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's what i was speaking to you
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
about um before representative elmi
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're definitely our audit division is
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
working hard on this they're still in
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
and as soon as we have any additional
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
information we will share that with the
 
01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.189 align:start position:0%
information we will share that with the
committee

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
see none go on to the real estate
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
all right real estate transfer tax this
 
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
all right real estate transfer tax this
tax

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
has been performing very well fiscal
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
year to date through march or 32.8
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
million or 27 percent ahead of plan
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
in 27.3 million or 21.5 percent ahead of
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've noted this before but i'll i'll
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
say it again just so we don't forget
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
when looking at fiscal year-to-date
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
um being that 21.5 ahead of prior year
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
we do want to note that there was a five
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
million dollar transfer
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
transfer this year to the affordable
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
housing fund that was new that did not
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
occur last year
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
so when looking at numbers compared to
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
you could add in an additional 5 million
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
moving us even further ahead of prior
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
year we also wanted to note
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
in some items to consider is mortgage
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
rate interest
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
um are historically low and seem to be
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
stable at this point
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's also some creativity with real
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
estate agents doing virtual home sales
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
available housing and property values as
 
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.430 align:start position:0%
available housing and property values as
factors

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
and also it's it's important to remember
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
that there are inventory shortages out
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
there they keep seeming to get bigger
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
every month as well of
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
cost of building supplies being um
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
more expensive than they have in prior
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
years and a lower affordability factor
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
meaning in the beginning of the pandemic
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
you had interest rates low and home
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
prices low and now you fast forward a
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
year later because of all the
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
competition in a buyer's market
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
you may have interest rates still low
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
but hos
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
housing prices have increased making
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
what people can afford
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
a smaller range than maybe they did a
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 our um our low is
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
201.5 million
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's 27 ahead of plan so essentially
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's assuming where we're at today is
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to continue through the rest of
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then our high is 205.7 million
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's 30
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan and that's in um
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to have a slight
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
increase from where we're at today
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
for our 22 ranges we have a negative 7
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
to a negative two percent this assumes
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to start strong
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the beginning of the fiscal year as
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
we are ending the fiscal year strong
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to be a gradual
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
shift down of performance less than what
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
it was for fiscal year 21.
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
and in 23 um we have negative 10 percent
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
to negative 8 percent
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
and this this picture essentially is
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
assuming historical trends were
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
maintained through fiscal year 20
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
through 22 so removing the housing spike
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
and what's happened today
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
if we were just continuing to grow
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
without this blip
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
um what would it look like and that
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
would put us negative 10
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
to negative 8 compared to 22 and this
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
also falls in line
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
with economist predictions for what the
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
housing market look like
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on real estate
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
just a question melissa
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think i read yesterday um
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
that the existing home prices for the
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
first time
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
exceed the price of new homes have you
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
been aware of that article um i haven't
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
read that yet
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be surprised um i do know i
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
how's the median sale price from last
 
01:19:46.159 --> 01:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
how's the median sale price from last
march

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
through this march is up 16 and a half
 
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.310 align:start position:0%
through this march is up 16 and a half
percent

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and year to date it's up 19 percent
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
so that does fall online yeah
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
you can't build houses fast enough
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay representative
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i think this may be related to
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
that and i don't know if it's occurring
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
but we have an enormous uh
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
lack of construction labor in our
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
in our part of the state and we've got a
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
projects planned and they're big
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
projects and i think they managed to
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
bring labor from somewhere else
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
and are going to probably be able to
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
build but
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
all of the smaller construction groups
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
just can't find enough people to do
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
i have because we don't have housing for
 
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.510 align:start position:0%
i have because we don't have housing for
them

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's a strange world we live in right
 
01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.470 align:start position:0%
it's a strange world we live in right
now

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
questions of most are on the real estate
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i think you're wise in what your
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
estimates are
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 because
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
all right we're almost there um utility
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh factors to consider for this fiscal
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
year to date through march were half a
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
million or 2.1 percent ahead of plan
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we are 400 000 or 1.7
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of prior year some factors to
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
consider for this tax
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
is property may decline in value due to
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
changes in economic conditions
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
if any new taxable property may be
 
01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:52.149 align:start position:0%
if any new taxable property may be
constructed

01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then lastly upt doesn't appear to be
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
impacted by covid19
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
thus far that we've seen for fiscal year
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
21 we don't have a range on this tax
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
either because it doesn't tend to swing
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
very far in either direction we end
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 21 estimate is 42.8
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
million or three percent below plan
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is a reduction for the remaining
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
months based on
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
reduction of utility property values
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
from the prior year
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
any questions on the utility property
 
01:22:31.199 --> 01:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
any questions on the utility property
tax

01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
okay i think you have some wrap-ups to
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
do all right
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think our last two slides um
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
are just
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
summary slides that hopefully are just
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
easier for you than having to go through
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
each slide
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
it gives a summary of our fiscal year 21
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
low and highs with that anomalous
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
receivable removed and then it has our
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
growth ranges for 22
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
and 23 and then our last slide
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is just an internal document that
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
we used but we thought we'd share that
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
might be helpful it's similar
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
to christie's we have fiscal year 20
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
audited revenue we have fiscal year 21
 
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
audited revenue we have fiscal year 21
plan

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
we then have the latest governor's
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
estimate as well as your estimate
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
which is pre-march data we have
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
our dra estimates that we gave to the
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
senate and they're saying that we're
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
giving today
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
which were done on the 19th those
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
contain march data
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and then we have our growth ranges for
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to note on this
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
slide although the numbers
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
may vary because the base is different
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
for 21 with this new march data
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the estimates are excuse me the
 
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.149 align:start position:0%
the estimates are excuse me the
percentages

01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
probably still fall within our
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
percentage so that's really
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
the area you want to look at for 22 and
 
01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.550 align:start position:0%
the area you want to look at for 22 and
23.

01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative romney
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thanks mr chair uh melissa do we
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
have a sense of when the senate will
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
have their revenue projections
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
done i don't think so i don't i don't i
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have us back again in may
 
01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:13.910 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have us back again in may
so

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
um i would assume not before may if
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
they're having us back here in the next
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
with the business and ind information
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%

what they're shooting for i'm just
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
curious the senate
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you ask me a question
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
say it again no do you have a sense of
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
when the senate what the senate is
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
shooting for to get their
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
their senate ways and means targets done
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
actually i haven't asked a
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
guider about that but we will be talking
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
later this week okay thank you
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh thank you chairman
 
01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:19.669 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh thank you chairman
major

01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um we
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
are getting closer to the governors
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to double check um
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
are all of his estimates also current
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
law because it seemed like
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes he was considering other
 
01:25:33.199 --> 01:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
sometimes he was considering other
factors

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good question chris shea might
 
01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.870 align:start position:0%
that's a good question chris shea might
know

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
i think these last ones are current law
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
but he has his hand up so i'm going to
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
let him take that
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh reps and major is it okay
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
to respond
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes um yes it's we worked with the
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office at the start of the
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
process to get
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh the base revenues to be current law
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
and any changes we put in a separate
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
section is uh changes the current law
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i have a sheet once a dra is done i
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with the committee
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
just to talk about real briefly based on
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of comments that were made
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
during the presentations
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
but yes this current law thank you
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative schamberg
 
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:27.189 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative schamberg
here

01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
president uh i have a question for the
 
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
president uh i have a question for the
chair

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh will the dra be back next week when
 
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:34.830 align:start position:0%
uh will the dra be back next week when
we

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:40.149 align:start position:0%
we
meet

01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
i expect that the dra will be with us
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
every time we meet with the revenues
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
and what i've done is i've scheduled web
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
revenues next week for wednesday
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
tuesday next week is going to be devoted
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
to work sessions on
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
senate bills well then
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
my question might be we're always trying
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
to get information
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
i wonder if the assistant commissioner
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer two questions
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
that i
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
when i read their fiscal notes
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 3 and senate bill 101
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
21-108 and 21-1047
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
i just wonder if they could just give me
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
they always say there's data not
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
available but
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh is the reason that there's not a line
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
on the bpt
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh or taxpayers report their gross
 
01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:38.870 align:start position:0%
uh or taxpayers report their gross
business

01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
income uh is that by rsa
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
is that by rule is that by i don't know
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
and the f e i n is that by rule that
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're not put on these forms
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh i just wonder if somebody could
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
answer that question carolyn
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
sure so the issue with respect to the
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
fbi ns
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that the small business
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
administration hasn't
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
given us the feins for the recipients
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the ppp loans so we definitely have
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
feins for all of our taxpayers on their
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
tax returns
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
but we would also need that data with
 
01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
but we would also need that data with
respect

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
to the list of loan recipients to match
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
them to come up with the impact
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to why that particular line
 
01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.550 align:start position:0%
with respect to why that particular line
isn't

01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
on the bpt tax return
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
um melissa can jump in if i'm incorrect
 
01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:35.830 align:start position:0%
um melissa can jump in if i'm incorrect
here

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't flow into the calculation
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the tax that they
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
owe and generally speaking um
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know that this is a statute but
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's a common practice
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
of departments of revenue we we try to
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
only ask for information that we
 
01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:50.629 align:start position:0%
only ask for information that we
actually

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
need to calculate the taxpayers tax
 
01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
need to calculate the taxpayers tax
liability

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you assistant commissioner thank
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
once more anybody have any questions
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
from the dra
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't see any so chris can you share
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
that information with us
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you represent major so during
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
the presentation there was a question
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
about um
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
current revenue versus um changes to
 
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
current revenue versus um changes to
revenue

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
and how that's accounted for and the
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
answer was provided i think by melissa
 
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
answer was provided i think by melissa
that

01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
you'll find it on a surplus statement
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
that our office prepares
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
so if you recall the the house finance
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee put out a
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
presentation on april 5th and within
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
that document you would find
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive surplus statement broken
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
out by general fund and education trust
 
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.470 align:start position:0%
out by general fund and education trust
fund

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
and in that you would find various
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments to revenues
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
as well as to your appropriations
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
because we account for
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
bills that may have passed the body that
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
had an appropriation assigned to it as
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
well as appropriations in house bill 2
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
to establish what the um house's
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
position is
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the budget we'll continue to do the
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
same thing on the senate side
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
one of the documents that you worked on
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll share it right now
 
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.110 align:start position:0%
and i'll share it right now
um

01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
during the uh last few times that we met
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
was this compare document which show was
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
showing you your estimates compared to
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the march 18th estimates and you'll
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
see the top half of that
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet are the current law revenue
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
estimates or your base estimates
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then the bottom half of that
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet are the changes the current
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
law where you address house bill 2
 
01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:46.709 align:start position:0%
law where you address house bill 2
changes

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
as well as other bills such as house
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill 281 which is the single sales
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
factor delay
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
and your committee made some um
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions on what you thought the
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
impacts would be
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
we took that information and we put it
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
rolled it forward
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
into the surplus statement i suspect
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
you might do the same thing as you're
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
going through your revenue estimates
 
01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.030 align:start position:0%
going through your revenue estimates
again

01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
you'll come up with your basic estimates
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
and you may look at some of the senate
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
bills that you
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
may support or not support and provide
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
an estimate related to that
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the status of some of the
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
positions you had
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
um related to the bills that you passed
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
maybe new information has come to light
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
or you feel um that you know the
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
estimate you made at the time should
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
something different and we would make
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
those adjustments on this type of sheet
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
so i think it was repsome southwest who
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
was asking the question i just wanted
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to know that we would help
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
you with that process and
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
um get you to a point of where you're
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
netting your your revenue so you see
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the bottom row is
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
um your base estimates against all the
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
adjustments you're making
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
gives you your new revenue estimate and
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
then that is carried into a surplus
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
statement and used against the budget
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is the most important sheet that
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
when you do an analysis of the budget
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
because as chris says your current law
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
is what you see above and then any
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
current law that's proposed in the
 
01:32:14.239 --> 01:32:15.189 align:start position:0%
current law that's proposed in the
budget

01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
you can see what effect it will have
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
then you can add the
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
the negative or the positive effect you
 
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:22.229 align:start position:0%
the negative or the positive effect you
can

01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
come up with your total line which is at
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then if if there's something in
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
addition to that
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's being considered you just add
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
another line
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
yep and and one other just a
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
brief comment when you do your house
 
01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.149 align:start position:0%
brief comment when you do your house
resolutions

01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's just based on the current law so
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's this top half that is in your house
 
01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
it's this top half that is in your house
resolution

01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's not the bottom half because that
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
gets um taken care of in the surplus
 
01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.790 align:start position:0%
gets um taken care of in the surplus
statement

01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
the top half of this is what goes into
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
the back of house bill one is your
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
so i just again just to clarify you know
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
some of the process here
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
and how it's done so what i foresee
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
doing is taking the
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
this middle area that has house ways and
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
means putting it over where the governor
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
estimates are and then putting your new
 
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
estimates are and then putting your new
estimates

01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
in here and then you could see any
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments you've made from your
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
um the the revenue estimates that are
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
part of your
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh proposed budget that passed over to
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else i i do not but
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
i see representative abrami and repson
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
southworth have their hands up
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative mr chair
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh chris so let's say we passed
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
sb3 yep and uh
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we know that and we have to project
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
our revenues for 2001 as they are
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be a lot more than
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh plan
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
um so that would be shown in the top
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
part so
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
would it would we then have to estimate
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
what we think the impact of sp3 will be
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 and reverse some of that
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
revenue out
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
for those years on the um on the bottom
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
of that sheet you just showed us
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly here in the surplus
 
01:34:20.639 --> 01:34:21.510 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly here in the surplus
statement

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
yep um so whatev whatever um
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
so the next surplus statement that will
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
be done will be on the senate phase of
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
so it'll be based on the senate's
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
position and then that the final
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
will a committee a conference will be
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
had between the house and the senate to
 
01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:38.629 align:start position:0%
had between the house and the senate to
iron

01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
iron
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
any differences out on the budget and
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
the final surplus statement would
 
01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:42.629 align:start position:0%
the final surplus statement would
consider

01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
anything that you've agreed to in terms
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the base revenue estimates
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
as well as any um changes to law
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
either in house bill one or other bills
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
that might impact
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
um your revenues thank you
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
and so you know in terms of the ppp you
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
know you don't have a year by year
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown of that so the committee would
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
would have to come up with some idea of
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
what they thought in 22 they think the
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
impact might be
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
and then in 23 what the impact might be
 
01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
and then in 23 what the impact might be
and

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
just as you did with the um single sales
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
factor delay where you you came up with
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
an estimate of 20 million dollar
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
gain in revenue in fiscal year um
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
23 as a result of that delay okay
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
so all right but that's the way it's
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to show though that's the key
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
yep yes you know we have a lot of
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
estimating to do though
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
so on the worksheet that we talked
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier you would you focus on
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of your base estimate you know
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
what what do you think revenue would be
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
if nothing were to change right now
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
right and then
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
you would have your discussions on okay
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
if we we agree with these
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
changes what do we think that impact
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
would be and do we add or
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh subtract revenue to get to a new new
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
number yep
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
sounds good thank you representative
 
01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.430 align:start position:0%
sounds good thank you representative
southwood

01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
southwood
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh both for chairman major
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
and for chris
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
i guess the reason i brought this up is
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
um i've had conversations
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
in a number of groups where people have
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
focused on the top half
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
and how well our revenues are doing and
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
so on and it just seems like
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
people don't really understand the
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
implications of the second half
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
and the surplus statement so i just
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
think it'll be really important
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
that we tie them together you know going
 
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.790 align:start position:0%
that we tie them together you know going
forward

01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
you know because people have thought we
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
were just passing on the top half so to
 
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.510 align:start position:0%
were just passing on the top half so to
speak

01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
um as our presentation to the senate and
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
really we weren't
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
we were passing along the top half
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
plus the possible deductions on the
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that's absolutely correct and and i
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
think another confusion that also
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
occurs um is that people will look at
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
the monthly revenue focus for instance
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
and say geez we're really doing great
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we're i'll pick a number 200
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars ahead of plan
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
but you've already considered some of
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
that revenue and you're estimating
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
so even when you're looking at you know
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
the fy 2021 plan
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
and you're reading the revenue focus
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
that comes out of administrative
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
services some of that surplus you're
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
seeing or that excess revenue you're
 
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
seeing or that excess revenue you're
seeing

01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
has already been accounted for in your
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
estimates so
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
so it's another confusion that occurs
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how you um
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
educate you know 400 people in in one
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
body and 24
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
in another as well as the public i mean
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
we do it through our briefings as much
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
as we can
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
but and we put it in all our documents
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
and make reference to our surplus
 
01:37:40.639 --> 01:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
and make reference to our surplus
statement

01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
but you're absolutely correct reps and
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
so forth i think there is confusion
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you this wouldn't help with the
 
01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
thank you this wouldn't help with the
plan

01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
problem but i'm wondering if we
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
and this would be for representative
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
major on
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
whether we could innovate on the house
 
01:38:04.639 --> 01:38:05.669 align:start position:0%
whether we could innovate on the house
resolution

01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
and include an estimate of
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
of surplus statement
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
on it when we give it to the other
 
01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.870 align:start position:0%
on it when we give it to the other
members

01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good suggestion it
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
an addendum to the house resolution
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
but it would add clarity to the total
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative spellsworth thank you mr
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
um this morning's discussion
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
included references to two
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
transfers that i don't recall previously
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
having heard about so
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to absorb what these are all
 
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.070 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to absorb what these are all
about

01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
and how similar they are and whether
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
there are many other examples so one was
 
01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
there are many other examples so one was
the

01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
draw for dhhs
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
from the liquor commission which i
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
gather was 8.2 million
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
for the affordable housing fund five
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the real estate
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh transfer tax am i correctly
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
understanding these to be
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted provisions that allow
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
for a transfer to cover a shortfall in a
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated program
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
or or am i misunderstanding that it's
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're half correct um so the
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
affordable um housing has was accounted
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
for in the surplus statement when that
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
became statute
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
what happens on a cash basis the money
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
comes in the door and then it's
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
transferred to the
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund so it will be um
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
reconciled you know out of the cash you
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
have two other instances of that
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
one is with the uh school building eight
 
01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
one is with the uh school building eight
debt

01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
service that comes out of meals and
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
rooms so you'll see an adjustment
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
um on the at the end of a month for an
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
amount so that's accounted for in your
 
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:09.910 align:start position:0%
amount so that's accounted for in your
estimates

01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
and it's right now it's about eight
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
for that and then the um second is the
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax where a portion
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
of that goes to
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
um l-chip program so it's
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
roughly four million dollars four to
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
five million dollars a year
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how um how many transfers
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
are occurring
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
um and so that is comes in the door on a
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
cash basis but then there's a transfer
 
01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.310 align:start position:0%
cash basis but then there's a transfer
made

01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
or it's carved out of the revenue it's
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
not counted towards the unrestricted
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
general fund revenue
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
the difference is with the dhhs one
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that that's unknown it's not planned
 
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.189 align:start position:0%
so that that's unknown it's not planned
for

01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the language just gives them the ability
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
to ask liquor to make that transfer if
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
they need the funds but there's there's
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
no plan for that or no
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
accounting of that because there's uh at
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
this point no way to
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
assume what they might need going
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying that three of the four
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
that you've just described
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
are budgeted are accounted for as part
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
of your revenue estimates yep
 
01:41:10.719 --> 01:41:14.790 align:start position:0%
of your revenue estimates yep
okay

01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you on chris i've been
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
wondering for some time whether lbao
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
weighs in with the finance committees
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
when they decide to do
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
something like this about the best way
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
to try to do it from the perspective of
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
the revenue committees it
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
makes it a lot more difficult to explain
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
to people what's happening to the
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
revenues and to ourselves
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
of lbao and proper accounting procedures
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure where it is and whether
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
you try to do anything about it when
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
they put these things in
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh the only i just sort of think i want
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
to respond here
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
what we do is make sure that what
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're suggesting works
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
but we don't try to influence the policy
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
or the end game that's trying to be
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
achieved so for instance the affordable
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
housing the way that was set up
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
that's practical that that is perfectly
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay to set it up in the fashion that
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
they did to restrict five million
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
have it paid out um i think on or before
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
october first of a particular fiscal
 
01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:34.709 align:start position:0%
october first of a particular fiscal
year

01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so so we don't do work with them
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
um to guide in that sense
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
but in terms of communicating with you
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
know ways and means and when they want
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we don't have a lot of uh
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility because some of these
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
types of things may be decisions that
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
occur in the last couple weeks of a
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
budget building process
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know maybe an idea that's been
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
floating around it may have been
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
considered in another bill
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then it gets brought into the the
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
budget preparation process
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
and so we just try to make sure it
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
technically works
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
but we don't try to say well this isn't
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
a good idea you really shouldn't do this
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
you should really have it go through
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
or any other policy committee unless i
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
have an opinion
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
on that if i could
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
hear this that if money is
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
to be appropriated they should be
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated from the general fund
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
because essentially that's what you're
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing is
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
when you take 5 million from meals and
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
rooms and you take
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
so much from tobacco or something else
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
you're taking it away from fun so it's
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
each one of these four items should be
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
debated and financed and
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
funded the general fund rather than
 
01:43:55.679 --> 01:43:56.070 align:start position:0%
funded the general fund rather than
saying

01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go through this
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislative process we're going to give
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
them this money but we're going to take
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
it directly out of
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals and that's
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
muddies up the water because you don't
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
really it's not a
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
true reflection of what we raise in
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
personally i would fight each and every
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
so many times with these types of
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
situations it's an
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
effort to try to dedicate a certain
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
amount of money to a certain
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
um area or function
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
so instead of establishing uh maybe a
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
new dedicated fund
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
in these cases there's instances of
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
taking revenue
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
and having it go directly to a
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
particular place
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
where maybe there's a fund already
 
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.350 align:start position:0%
where maybe there's a fund already
established

01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
um but i mean that's a debate i think
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh members would need to have with
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
themselves again we just
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the language and
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
policy seems to
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
work the way the uh group or committee
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
has intended
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
for it to work and you do a good job
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i i might just like to
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
point out that one of those things
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
made fiscal sense i didn't like it but
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
we uh we had to pay for the school
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
bonding that was
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
already is obliged and on
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
to do that they had to have a specific
 
01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.950 align:start position:0%
to do that they had to have a specific
source

01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
for the the bonding and that was
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms revenue yeah
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
hey any further questions for chris
 
01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
i'm roxanne tucker that's not a question
 
01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.709 align:start position:0%
i'm roxanne tucker that's not a question
but

01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
i think that uh right now the
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's bonding for water projects that
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
didn't get funded this year and uh
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the school aid did
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time so these
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
things vary
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
depending on who's making the decisions
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
but i agree with you i think it's a
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
circumvention of the process
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
to have a last-minute
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
draw on these funds makes it very hard
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
for people to understand
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
we did that at the in the early part of
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
the great recession
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
when we had this tail that we felt
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
obliged to pay for
 
01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:40.910 align:start position:0%
well we have what
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:42.950 align:start position:0%
well we have what
[Music]

01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
respect the obligation we'll see what
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
the senate does
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that representative
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
um a process question uh
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
so at the top of our revenue estimate
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
worksheet we have the
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
official plan for fy2021
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then we've um we've we estimated
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
several times over the past two years
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if the final numbers
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
we come up with for 2021
 
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
become the official plan when we vote on
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
or if those always stay as we
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
estimated in 2019 how the official plan
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
is developed
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's after the budget is passed
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the department of administrative
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
services checks of all the agencies
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
and they examine each and every one of
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
these revenue streams
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
and what they do each month historically
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they come up with the best estimate
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
as is how much of the total
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
is derived in july
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
august september etc and that becomes an
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
official plan based on the budget
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't develop that we may
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
have some input
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
into it but it's the administrative
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
services that does that
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that sticks with us for the whole
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
two years everything
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
measured against the plan and so our
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
work of re-estimating 2021
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's already been officially voted on
 
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.189 align:start position:0%
that's already been officially voted on
and

01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
right it will either be
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
above or below the plan is it is it an
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
effort to help the finance committee
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
spend funds by re-estimating
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
will monitor how the revenues are coming
 
01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
will monitor how the revenues are coming
in

01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
and if revenues are coming in lower and
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
they have to start
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
making adjustments uh they want to know
 
01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.430 align:start position:0%
making adjustments uh they want to know
that

01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
early in the year they don't want to
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
know it in
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
in may because it's too late yes
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments so so they look at what our
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
revenues are
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
against the plan because the
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah i
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
guess i was wondering if
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
um the 2021
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
official plan numbers um
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
are relevant after
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
june 30th of the year well they are
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
relevant because that's what the budget
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
was based upon now to
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
implement the budget you use that
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
but if the revenues are coming in less
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
then the executive branch has got to
 
01:49:59.599 --> 01:50:01.109 align:start position:0%
then the executive branch has got to
stop

01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
reducing spending in order to be able to
 
01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.390 align:start position:0%
reducing spending in order to be able to
keep

01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
one more question modified by the
 
01:50:10.239 --> 01:50:11.350 align:start position:0%
one more question modified by the
revenues

01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
and new revenues one one more question
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
um so the dra does their high and low
 
01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.430 align:start position:0%
um so the dra does their high and low
percentages

01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
off of the plan numbers so
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the year well they do
 
01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:27.510 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the year well they do
their

01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry they do their estimates based
 
01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.790 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry they do their estimates based
upon

01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
past performance not off the plan
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay the plan is
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
is only developed after the budget is
 
01:50:44.159 --> 01:50:46.470 align:start position:0%
is only developed after the budget is
passed

01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
all right you take a few months to
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
usually the budget will pass
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
by the end of june and then you won't
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
see the plan
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
for a few months right it could be three
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
when you do the revenue focus uh for
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
july in august you won't see a plan when
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
you see their comparison against
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
like chris i was just going to add a
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
little bit but
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
generally represent major covered it
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
represent marlowe but
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
what's important about the having the 21
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
plan is just so as you're working on
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
estimates and
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where 21 might end
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
up you can kind of see
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
where the committee two years ago
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
kind of thought the plan might end up in
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
terms of revenues
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
and gives you kind of a base to see you
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
know are we doing something
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
wildly crazy here compared to what we've
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
done in the past
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
um you know and is there a reason for
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
that you know m r you
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
you had a plan of 386.9 million you know
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit and
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
now you're down to 311 uh
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
311 was what you you passed just based
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
on the information
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
so what it the intention is to give you
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
a sense of when you're building your
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
base number for 21
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
that you're going to build your 22 23
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
off from
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's no changes to the official plan
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
as represent major indicated
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
because that plan number is is basically
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
was used to help budget
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 21 appropriate
 
01:52:33.679 --> 01:52:35.430 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 21 appropriate
appropriations

01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
so it's good that it's uh the numbers
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
are much higher than what was in plan
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
that means that you're doing pretty well
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
with the the revenue and we should end
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
in a good position
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
it becomes uh much more concerning when
 
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.310 align:start position:0%
it becomes uh much more concerning when
you're

01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
your current year that you're in against
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
plan that shows a negative number
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
and what might be happening with trends
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
in your revenue
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
going forward you're going to going to
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
only see a plan for fiscal year 22 and
 
01:53:00.159 --> 01:53:01.350 align:start position:0%
only see a plan for fiscal year 22 and
23.

01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
23.
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you one more one more thing
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
the revenues coming in with business
 
01:53:11.599 --> 01:53:12.310 align:start position:0%
the revenues coming in with business
taxes

01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
is huge compared to what the plan is
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
and it might lead some people to say hey
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
we can spend more money on projects
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
because we have all this extra money but
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
they have to understand
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
why that money is extra and
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
how much of it they they want to be
 
01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:33.830 align:start position:0%
how much of it they they want to be
careful

01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
careful
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
of saving because you may lose it in the
 
01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
of saving because you may lose it in the
future

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a comment i want to
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank uh representative gamora for that
 
01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank uh representative gamora for that
uh

01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%

process question it was a nice uh
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
reminder of how this whole thing works
 
01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.070 align:start position:0%
reminder of how this whole thing works
it's

01:53:54.070 --> 01:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
i know i've heard it before but it's
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's good to be reminded
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
of how um how
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
our job and what it is we do
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
helps to explain things and i would also
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
add that i've had the question
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
of what are we doing with the extra
 
01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:12.070 align:start position:0%
of what are we doing with the extra
extra

01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the the projections of the
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
and those revenues that are coming in so
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
this is helpful too
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
i was not really able to effectively
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
answer that question so that's all it's
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else questions or

tomorrow
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
will bring us up to date on what he
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
feels the new hampshire economy is doing
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
and that's at 10 o'clock so who is the
 
01:55:38.159 --> 01:55:39.669 align:start position:0%
and that's at 10 o'clock so who is the
economist

01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
economist
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
it is brian gottwa
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful i know just who you mean
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
