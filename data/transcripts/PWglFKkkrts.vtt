season and
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
one moment yeah hi my name is Diane
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
Timmons hi everyone welcome um thank you
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
for welcoming us to make this edit um it
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
was an oversight on our part that was
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention and we meant to
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
remove that given some circumstances
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
with staff at fishing game it was missed
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so we're hoping to strike the
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
language um that simply States Beyond
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
two fish that one of which could be 16
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
in or larger this is an impact to our
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
constituents that and it conflicts with
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
our rules for bass tournaments so we'd
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
like to strike that simple just that end
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
piece um everything else is intact but
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
strike that nend piece so that we don't
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
have conflicting rules with our Bass
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
Tournament folks and our Bass
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%

making register was dated 41
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
2024 their hearing date was 523 2024
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
which is 4 2 days notice above the
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
statutory 20 days required their comment
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%

testimony about the fiscal impact
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
statement being inadequate however the
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
review of the fiscal impact appeared to
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
be a review of a fiscal note worksheet
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
which is for a bill not a rule the
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal no the fiscal impact statement
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
for a rule has different requirements
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
and the dees and the LBA did not um
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
violate any of those um so I have no
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
frame the the the the rules a little bit
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is a res the latest Visions are a
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
result of a statute from the legislature
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
giving me till till the 1st of November
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
uh 23 to do ruem and this this is that
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
and and the context of that is uh
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
regarding past contamination how it
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
should be handled uh so soil standards
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
water contamination that type of thing
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
that has been probably the agency's
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
single most
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh effort uh since since I've been uh
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner we spent probably more time
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
on that one issue than anything else and
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's been of great concern not only to
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
our constituents but to to obviously the
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
regulated uh industry also uh but
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
certainly to anybody who has a private
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
well or drinks water which I think is
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
everybody so so with that Mike did you
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
comments sure so um the staff attorneys
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
have addressed the issues uh raised by
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
the commenters regarding uh public
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
notice and uh and the fiscal impact
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
statement certainly in full agreement
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
with that there were about four other
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
items that were brought up by commenters
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
which I'm at the committee's pleasure
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
happy to address
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
briefly okay so uh one of the uh
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
criticisms that was levied was that um
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
the definition of responsible parties in
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the rules was um somehow um written
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and became more expansive
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
than Allowed by Statute but in fact the
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
rule is written correctly the definition
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
responsible party clearly identifies
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
only those entities that are required to
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
conduct activities pursuant to specific
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
statutes and the word required in the
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
rules specifically points to the statute
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
that establish those requirements so the
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
rule doesn't change who is responsible
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
and that is established by the statute
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
the rule simply established
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
process uh the second item um was that
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
it was uh suggested that um the rule
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
would impermissibly regulate a large
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
number tens of thousands of past
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
compounds because the definition of
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
pasas in the in the rule is Broad and
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that is correct it is Broad but it
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
does not impose additional requirements
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
on those particular compounds um we we
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
received that comment on the initial
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
proposal we addressed it um past is bro
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
is a broadly defined term in the statute
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
and um however there's only four Pas
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
compounds that we currently regulate by
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
way of an ambient groundwater quality
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
standard or a soil remediation standard
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and this rule simply proposes new soil
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
remed ration standards for those four
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
compounds um but we were also directed
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
45 h13 um through a bill that was passed
 
00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.189 align:start position:0%
45 h13 um through a bill that was passed
in

00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
20122 directed us and gave us the to do
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
this rul making and gave us the
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
authority to require testing for a
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
broader Suite of past
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
compounds with the legislature
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
understood that this is an area of
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
Regulation that is evolving and that
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
there are a number of compounds that
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to learn about and it
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
wanted us to have the authority to
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
require testing for those so that we
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
when we do have more information about
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
potential health effects we'll be in a
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
position to know what the occurrence of
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
these compounds is around the state in
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater and soil Etc so the that
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
directive really necessitates that the
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
definition of p house be broad so that
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
we can then and and then in fact in part
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
614 of the rule we do uh require that
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances um testing
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
for this broader Suite of past compounds
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
can be required by the department and
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
then the the next issue that was uh
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
criticism that was levied was that um
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules expand the
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
notification requirement for
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
notification uh excuse me notification
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for violations of ambient
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standards and that
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
that was an excess of statutory
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
Authority and in fact there's no change
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
in the language in this proposed rule
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
from what exists in the in the in the
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
existing rule currently the text of the
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
rule that was quoted by the commenter um
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
left out an internal citation to a sub
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph that left uh the reader
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
thinking that somehow um the agency
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
would have the authority to decide um at
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
its will at its discretion who would um
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
need to make notification of a violation
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
of an ambient groundwater quality
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
standard and if you read the the um the
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
actual quotation in or the the actual
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
rule it's clear that the the
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
notification requirements are not being
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
expanded um and then the lastly uh the
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
final proposal
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
there was a a suggestion that the notice
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
requirements and obligations on
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
responsible parties um were um were were
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
expanded impermissibly and the changes
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
are clearly within the Department's
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and are needed to
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
protect human health um by giving notice
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
of releases of regulated contaminants to
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
potentially affected parties um just as
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
notices currently required for oil
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
spills so we believe that this is a a
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
necessary and and subject and
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
in in line with the statutory Authority
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's been granted to the agency and
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
lastly there was a comment that the
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
rules are just simply not in the public
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
interest and I guess what I'd say these
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
rules are absolutely in the public
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
interest they're necessary to protect
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
Public Health uh releases of regulated
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
pfast chemicals to soil and groundwater
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
have impacted thousands of public and
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
private drinking water wells in New
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire affecting tens of thousands of
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
residents who rely on those Wells for
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
Safe Drinking Water um and in fact the
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
department initiated the rul making as I
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned based on a directive from the
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to address this issue um the
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
statute requires the commissioner to
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
initiate rulemaking on this and we've
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
done that we've carefully considered and
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
developed the rulemaking in
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
consideration of the public comments
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
that have been received and we recommend
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
the committee approve the
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
rules thank you questions from the
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you we have
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
two speakers that want to speak on this
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
I believe um and just to be clear this
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
there's a uh conditional approval so
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's what the motion would be
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
on uh next up is from rra Young and Pell
 
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.630 align:start position:0%
on uh next up is from rra Young and Pell
the

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
James and Nat she be from Bia I think is
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
him thank you thank you Senator with
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
your permission I'd like to join him
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
because it's uh bia's hired wrath to uh
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
represent us um Nate gray with uh
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association I'm
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
joined up here by attorney stous from uh
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
wrath young and Pik melli uh just very
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
briefly we have four uh major objections
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh to this uh rule uh first uh we
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
believe that Dees did not conduct
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
adequate an adequate fiscal impact in
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
violation of RSA
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
541a second we believe the proposed
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
rules exceed The Authority given to the
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
department by the legislature by
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
regulating more than the four statutory
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
regulated uh past compounds and Chang
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
the definition of responsible party
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
third uh we believe there was inadequate
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
public uh notice provided during the
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
drafting process and four we believe the
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
rules are not in the public interest
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
I'll refer to uh attorney Stein Krauss
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
information good morning Senator Lang
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative lion and steam members of
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative committee on
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rules my name is James
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
steincross I'm an attorney with wrath
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
young pelli representing the business
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
and industy Association of New Hampshire
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
and we'd ask that the committee object
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
to final proposed rules enbo r600 for
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
the contamin site management uh on the
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
basis that the rules are beyond the
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
authority of the agency not in the
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
public interest and will have
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
substantial economic impacts on the
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
regulated Community um I have submitted
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony in more detail would
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
like to provide a brief summary of the
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
points raised by uh my colleague n First
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
DS did not conduct adequate fiscal
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
impacts uh they did not comply with RSA
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
541 a13 part 4D or jail car rule
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
44.1 a 1-5 because they failed excuse me
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
to undertake a detailed cost benefit
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
analysis of the impact of the final
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
propos rules on the state it Citizens
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
Independent businesses and the regulated
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
Community given the pervasive nature P
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
across the state the expansive
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
responsible parties definition as raised
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
earlier and the increased reporting
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
obligations resulting from those
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and the definition of
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
regulated contaminants when D sets the
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
soil mediation standards as opposed to
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
the ambient groundwater quality
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
standards set by Statute the costs are
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
borne from the regulations not from the
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
statute therefore the fiscal analysis
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
failed to consider the substantial
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for costs resulting from
 
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.430 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for costs resulting from
these

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
rules second we argue the DS did not
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
provide adequate public notice to
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the initial website notice
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
was issued on May 17th but that was
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh more than a month after it was
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
published the rules were published on
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
April 11th and the initial common period
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
did not give stakeholders adequate
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
notice and time for these very complex
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
rules um Bia did ask for a one-month
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
extension and will granted additional
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
two weeks by Dees uh second the final
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
proposed rules also included new
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
language in EN o 61.0 6D which are new
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions not previously included in
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
Prior drafts and subject to public
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
comment Bia believes that the rules
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
exceed statutory Authority for de asked
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
for four reasons first as addressed
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
previously the express expansive
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
definition of responsible parties in
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
6023 to 34 impermissibly subject
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
individuals land ordinance business to
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
liability without legislative Authority
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
specifically anyone ordered to uh
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
conduct investigation or remediation
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
could also fall within parties
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
undertaking investigation Remediation in
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
support of their statutory defenses both
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
under federal and state law or
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
conducting uh site assessments where
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
they undertake take a voluntary
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
investigation but may result in required
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
sampling and Remediation the definition
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
of pasas is expanded as to tens of
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of past which would
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
impermissibly be regulated and fails to
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
include the exemptions and Li
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
limitations rep in representative eel's
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1649 recently enacted in
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
chapter 349 of the acts of 2024
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
specifically with respect to the
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
regulated contaminants broad definition
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
which exceeds the existing requirements
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules expand the
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
notification requirements for violations
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
of the ambient groundwater quality
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
standards and excessive statutory
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
Authority by shifting that burden from
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
the Department onto responsible parties
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that also goes towards the
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
application of notice requirements for
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
responsible parties given the broad
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
Suite of regulated containment is now
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
subject to immediate
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
notifications that's referencing 6046
 
00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:50.669 align:start position:0%
notifications that's referencing 6046
and

00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
6049 finally the Bia believes that the
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
rules are not in the public interest for
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
several reasons first the rules as
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
written cannot be uniform formally
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
applied because the rules are
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
technically infeasible to enforce as
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
implemented given the low past levels
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
set by table 602 6002 below background
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
levels across the state impossible to
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
meet financially by the regulated
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
Community as a whole and unlikely to be
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
met or enforced that to serve as an
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
effective prohibition contrary to 541
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
a13 part 4C and G call rules
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
40302 B1 a through C second J car rule
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
43.0 1 C requires that the that Dees use
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
that they use broad language when more
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
specific requirements are needed and
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
this is evidenced by de's response to
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
comments indicating that the rules will
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
be implemented by quote developing
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
guidance outside of the rulem process
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
and five separate responses to comments
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
noted at page 7-8 page 12 page 13 16 and
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
18 of their
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
comments finally DS did not adequately
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
respond to public comments critical of
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
the substantial economic impacts not
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
recognized in its fiscal impact
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
statement contrary to jrco rule 40301 a
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
1-2 and
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
4041 B and thank you very much for your
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
time and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
have questions from the
 
00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
committee so I I do have one so I had to
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
look up that bill that you referenced
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
1649 and in that bill it uses an
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
extremely broad definition of pasas
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
right ites it's not specific and it's s
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
like you were saying it was specific but
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
it says uh in the bill the definition of
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
p means all uh P substances so all all
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
versions it does but in 1649 uh part 8
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's a revision to the liability and
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
which defines a p facility is any
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
facility having uh groundwater or
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
surface water discharges of 10,000
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
nanograms per liter or 10,000 parts per
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
liter whereas the uh solar mediation
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
standards in existing ambient water
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
quality standards groundwater quality
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
standards are lower so that's where we
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
see a conflict with existing rules with
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
respect to liability that attaches
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
through the responsible parties it's so
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's not the uh and the regulated
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
contaminant ask you for permission for
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
followup excuse um uh so it's not uh so
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
your question isn't the the number of
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
the chemicals that they're doing because
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
obviously this one the definition of p
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
pass is so broad um but it's the
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
standard that they set for and for
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
trigger but it's it's actually
 
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.470 align:start position:0%
trigger but it's it's actually
both

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
apologize one
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
second the definition is also Federal
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
sorry yes and as a matter of legislative
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
intent several amendments were offered
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
to focus the definition of pasas in that
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
bill and they were rejected by the
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
legislature so that the legislative
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
intent is clearly to include as many
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
chemicals as
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you I have a question for
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
the administrative rule attorneys it's
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
my um thought that a cost benefit
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
analysis is different than fiscal impact
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
statement so can you make a comment on
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
what what the how the Co rules address
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
that so a fiscal impact statement um
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
primarily compares the existing rule to
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
the proposed rule um that's mainly what
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're focused on and there's a big
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
focus on not adding costs to political
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions citizens businesses so it
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
it's not an a it's not a fiscal note
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
worksheet that you see with bills where
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
the agency has gone through and talked
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
about dollar amounts and how much it's
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to impact or benefit it's it's a
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
much um TR more truncated fiscal impact
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
statement and in this case the the
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
department um did their fiscal impact
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
request correctly and the LBA gave a a
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
substantial fiscal impact in in terms of
 
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
what we do um if the problem is the
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact in this case then it's a
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
problem with our our system and with
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
what what the LBA is reviewing but as
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
far as what how the rules work now this
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
was an adequate fiscal impact thank
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you would
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
the agency like to step up and comment
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
on anything that was said before
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
welcome back commissioner thank
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
you so if it uh pleases a committee I'll
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'll have Mike whims address
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
this thank you uh members of the
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
committee so um I guess what I I would
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
just note is that um with respect to
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1649 I did not mention it in
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
my original comments but I I think the
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
comment or misunderstands the scope and
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
effect of the specific provisions of
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
that statute and in fact the statutory
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are enacted in 1649 are
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
independently effective we're not
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
attempting to implement 1649 with this
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
rul making and I I hope that that helps
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity and then with
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
respect to the uh the public notice
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
issue um we uh met met the certainly the
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements um but we went
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
quite beyond that in fact it was
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
published in the rulemaking register
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
when required well in advance of the
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
hearing we also as an additional
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
assistance posted on our website uh
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
nearly at the same time and then um the
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
the May publication on our website was
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
actually a later courtesy publication on
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
a different web page just to make sure
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
we captured additional people that might
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
be looking at that particular location
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
but we went above and well above and
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
beyond the public notice requirements
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
with respect to that um beyond that I
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
guess I don't really have too much else
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
to offer theer questions any questions
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
for the agency have to follow up see
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
none thank you so before the committee
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
is a conditional approval request on on
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh rule
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
2465 is there a motion so moved I'm
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
sorry uh moved by representative grot
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
second second by uh representative Lynn
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all those in
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
favor of a conditional approval on 2465
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
signify by saying I I oppose nay the
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
it next up is uh installation Standards
 
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
2469 so these rules um have been expired
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
since April of
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
2022 so we thought the committee might
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
good morning Tina Kelly uh rules
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
coordinator at the office of
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
certification um as far as the rules
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
were enforced they were not enforced
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
during that time but for installation
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
standards the the um RSA 205- D colon 4
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire yes thank thank you Mr
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
chair in uh
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
70301 it the rule
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
requires that new manuals for
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
installation supplied by the
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
manufacturers go to the
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
board are you actually
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
enforcing that rule and are you
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
enforcing any changes in the uh in the
 
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
enforcing any changes in the uh in the
manuals

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
manuals
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
not at this
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
time what they're relying on is under
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
D4 um it would be the New Hampshire
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
installation standards as developed
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
which doesn't apply because they've
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
expired the design prepared by the
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
registered professional engineer or
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
architect for the site that that would
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
be required because that's in statute
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturer installation
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
instructions provided that such
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
instructions meter exceed New Hampshire
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
installation standards developed by the
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
board they would meet or exceeded those
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
cuz there aren't any
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
presently right
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
but my concern is that you're allowing
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers to make changes to
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
think to standards that are required by
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
the regulated Community without anybody
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
correct uh rickia medley board counsel
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
for the inst ation Standards Board um my
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are federal
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
regulations that would uh provide those
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
standards and the uh board would um then
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
adopt those standards except that they
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
Haven for the last two and a half
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
years and that is why we're doing this
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
now but the the board is not an elected
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
body and we can't just accept their the
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
federal rules without a vote of an
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
elected body
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
I I understand that uh the this board
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
was uh put in place there were Federal
 
00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
Regulations um that were um put in place
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
whether the federal government would
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
Monitor and handle this or whether it be
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
with the state um and the state decided
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
to have a board to handle that um but
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
they do defa to the Federal Regulations
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
but if you'd like more information that
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
can be provided well I would excuse
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
followup I just want to make a statement
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
that our constitution explicitly forbids
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
any requirement that is not voted on by
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
the people or their elected
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
representatives and this sure looks like
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
something that has not been voted on by
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
any representatives of the people so I'm
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
this thank you further questions from
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
the committee is there a motion so we're
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
69 all right so we're can stand here and
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
look at each other all day um uh Doug
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
want you to tell us what our options are
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
on this given represented Maguire's uh
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about the adoption of federal
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
standards within a rule without an
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
vote um you can move to approve or you
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
could do a preliminary objection and
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
have the agency come back with an
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
explanation um you would if you want to
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
postpone and take it up in another
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
meeting you would need a waiver of the
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
preference I'll move to object I'll
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
second it's been moved by representative
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
Maguire seconded by Senator avar to
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
object to um the final proposal on rule
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
2469 any further
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
discussion see none all those in favor
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
objection say I I I all those oppos n we
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
seal okay so um this proposal um has two
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
issues to discuss uh the first one is
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
about the need for some legislation to
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
address a conflict in the statutes
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see that comment on the top of
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
page one of the proposal uh also page
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
five of the PDF meeting packet basically
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
the language of RSA 205 D12 conflicts
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
with the fee setting authority of the
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
oplc in RSA
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
3105 so um basically the board still has
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
fee setting Authority so um we wanted to
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
point this out in case anybody wants to
 
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
to take up some legislation this next
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
session the uh second issue is that the
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
proposal contains expired fees um
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
expired rules with fees meaning that the
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't set the fees the rules
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
do you'll see comments about that on
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
page two of the proposal or page six of
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
the PDF meeting packet uh the rules with
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
the warranty seals fee expired in uh
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
April of
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
2022 and the oplc rules that establish
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
the new fee U those rules were adopted
 
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
in August 1st of 2023 so there's roughly
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half Gap in which
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
there was presumably no authority to
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
collect the fee so the committee may
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
have some questions about the
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement of um that particular
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
section represent Maguire yes thank you
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I can't speak to the fees but I
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
believe the installation Standards Board
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
statutory conflict between their their
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
laws and the oplc laws is is being
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
addressed in a bill that I've submitted
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
this year and if not it will be so we'll
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislatively uh any further comment or
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
question agency want to say anything hi
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%

oplc um as far as the fees go PLC
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
10223 applies to application and
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
processing fees and that was adopted on
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
81 of 2023 PLC
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
10116 addresses warranty seals and that
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
was adopted by oplc on 715 of
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
2022 um approximately three months I did
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
check with oplc no fees were were
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
collected during that
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
time and then it's go ahead I ask any
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
further questions that was all
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
anybody i' entertain a motion to approve
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
the final proposal
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
the move by representative McGuire
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
second by representative Schmidt any
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion on
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
2469 seeing none all those in favor say
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
I I all those oppos nay eyes have it
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
guys next up is the Department of
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
2486 uh so the department did submit a
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request which dealt
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
with pretty much all the substantive
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
comments on this particular rules uh
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal however there
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
is one informational note remaining that
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
also applies to the next proposal
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
20249 um the statute in which the
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
proposal is making changes to
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
implement the effective date is unique
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
in that it will go into effect 90 days
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
after certification that the animal
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
records database becomes operation
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
I then went and looked at the bill to
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
see if there was any further
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
clarification and the bill language
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
itself says that the certification has
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
to be done by the department to the
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and the director of
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative Services uh I
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
did reach out to the OLS director
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday he is unaware of any
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
certification coming in from the
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
Department um he is fairly new to the
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
position so he was going to ask around
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
to see if perhaps that was done prior
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
but as far as I'm aware that
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
certification has not happened so
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
therefore the
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
database hasn't been certified and these
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
rules therefore really should not be
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
adopted until the database is certified
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
and is operational for 90
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
comments good morning uh Patricia Benner
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
legislative coordinator for the
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
food Steve Crawford State V New
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Agriculture
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
markets and food
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
um that is news to us I my understanding
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
was that the commissioner had submitted
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
that letter on October 8th so we will go
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
back and look and figure that out um
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
October 8th gave us 90 days to make this
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
eff of January 6th so
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
um I had not heard that that was a
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
question until now so I I'll go back and
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
confirm that after
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
this any questions from the
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
committee so Doug and to be clear clear
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
um if it is affect if it has been
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
affected for 90 days then the department
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
just needs to adopt after after January
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
6th okay um and I I guess just a point
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
of clarification just so I'm
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
understanding the comments in both of
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
these rules say that it has to have
 
00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:51.670 align:start position:0%
these rules say that it has to have
been

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
it I I I we read the the statute
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
differently the statute sh says that use
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the system becomes mandatory 90 days
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
after it is certified as operational not
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
after 90 days of being in operation
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
operational and operating to my mind are
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
different I think we're we're reading
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
the statute to mean uh 90 days after the
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
certification okay and so if you did
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
that certification in October we just
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have like I said we had change
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
over in in Staffing so we we couldn't
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
find that information so if that's
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
already done as long as the rules are
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
adopted after the 90day which you said
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
was January 6 then that's
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
fine okay so um yeah we I'll check with
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner after
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
this so if I can understand what you
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
guys are just talking about um we could
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
approve this however the rule can't take
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
effect until January 6th correct and and
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
when the agency adopts they can specify
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
the the later effective date great okay
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
is there a mo to approve it's been moved
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
by sen second by sen the ward any
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
further discussion all those in favor
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
say I I I'll oppose n eyes have it thank
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
very much next up is
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
2490 uh so this proposal also had a
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request which dealt
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
with the majority of the substantive
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
comments however there were two that
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
were remaining um the first is on page
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
two of the conditional approval request
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
text this has to do with the definition
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
of reasonable times the agency defines
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable times but then includes
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
additional language that is not
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
considered defining language uh they
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
include after the definition which are
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
subject to unannounced inspection by the
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
department and accessibility to the
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
public for return of pets in accordance
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
with RSA
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
4376 this is
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
essentially uh a requirement that is set
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
in the stat statute the statute
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
specifically says that lenses have to
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
allow the department to do unannounced
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
visits during reasonable times so the
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
department has defined the term in the
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
statute appropriately and then
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
additionally later in the rules it also
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
talks about the department being able to
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
go in to inspect records during
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable time so it's also later
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
clarified in the rules so that
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
additional language in the definition uh
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't comply with the manual and it is
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
also unnecessary
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
um the second comment is on page 11 of
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval request text
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
this comment came from um some public
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that we saw in the public
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony the commenter stated that
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
behavioral Rehabilitation did not
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
include basic training and housebreaking
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
when it came to Foster facilities in the
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
Department's response they agreed that
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
that's not considered behavioral
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and that if the commenter
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
was aware of any instances of foster
 
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.309 align:start position:0%
was aware of any instances of foster
facility

00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
applying based on those grounds to let
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
them know and then they will
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
investigate um this created an unclear
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
comment because it seems as though some
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
in the regulated Community don't
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what behavioral
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation means um and if the
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
department is then going to go and
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
enforce the rule based on what they have
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
represented they believe it means um it
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
create some
 
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
confusion uh additionally it would be an
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
easy fix the Department could just
 
00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
simply put in the rule and clarify that
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
basic house training uh basic training
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
and housebreaking is not considered
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral Rehabilitation um but the
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
department responded to that comment
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
from OS that they didn't believe that
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
including a specific example in such a
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
broad category was necessary um but
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
those are the only two comments I have
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
proposal agcy did you have anything you
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
want to say or
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
okay um so regarding the reasonable
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
times and I
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
again maybe my misunderstanding of the
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
process we have been told but I have
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
been told many many times over the years
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
that adding statutory language to a rule
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
is better just Bel and suspenders we did
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
that here so if it's not appropriate as
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
a definition then we can take it out as
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
long as it is still clear to the
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
regulated community that it it's not
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
just the the comment we got back I think
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
was limited to unannounced inspections
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
by Department employees and uh Council
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
only referenced the ability to review
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
records and that's not why that's not
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
the only reason we're going so we just
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that our regulated
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
Community understood we can review
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
records we are doing an inspection
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the reasonable times um
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
includes if the reference and statute is
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
adequate then that's fine with me that
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's clear to them um regarding
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
behavioral Rehabilitation
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
um it seemed reasonable to respond to
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
the commenter that if you're we agree
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
please report that to us and we can look
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
into it the concern that I have I have
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
developed over close to 20 years of
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
being a regulator is both in statute and
 
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.430 align:start position:0%
being a regulator is both in statute and
in

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
discretion we we have some regulatory
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
discretion when we say medical and
 
00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:14.589 align:start position:0%
discretion when we say medical and
behavioral

00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
behavioral
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation we don't go out to punish
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
first we go out to educate and get
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
people compliant
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
first when you start to create lists
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
that you regulate upon and you create
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
you add one thing to that list it is
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
easy for the regulated community that
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
you're punishing to say well clearly if
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
the experts thought to add one example
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
and they didn't include something else
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
then that that other thing doesn't count
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
lists are really difficult when you're
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
regulating if they're not complete they
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
always create
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
loopholes if there was a full list in
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
there that's a reasonable thing I think
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
but to add one example that this is not
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
behavioral Rehabilitation we don't we
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
think creates more confusion rather than
 
00:48:54.799 --> 00:48:57.950 align:start position:0%
think creates more confusion rather than
less

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Dr Crawford is
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
behavioral Rehabilitation defined
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere no ma'am not not in not in
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
detail re Rehabilitation
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
broadly going
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
from a state of inadequacy to
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
Improvement the two things that are most
 
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.510 align:start position:0%
Improvement the two things that are most
common

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
are badly behaved aggressive animals or
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
very nervous animals putting them into a
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
home to rehabilitate them to
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate them to a normal a state
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
where they would be acceptable house
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
pets is what we're
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
thinking thank you you're welcome and so
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
you agree on the first item of unclear
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
intent we're okay with striking that
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
last part of that definition if if if it
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit in the definition that's
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
fine again we we have over the years
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
many many times been told to add the
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
statutory language to rules to make it
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
more clear if it's not appropriate as a
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
definition that's fine and then on the
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
second item my sorry just had one
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
comment on that reasonable times um so
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
it it is part of um what our vendors
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
look to um to explain reasonable times
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
that it includes the inspection
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
unannounced inspections um so just from
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know my other hat hearings examiner
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
it has come to light that that seems to
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
be an issue to hang a hat on um so it it
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
proves helpful to have it um in the
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
definition just say so I don't again I I
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
think the issue is I don't necessarily
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
disagree with you that it belongs in the
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
rule but I'm just saying it's in the
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
wrong place under a definition that
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet our our our general rule of
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
what defining a definition you can't put
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
a definition and a requirement in the
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
same parag definition is definition a
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirement is a requirement so uh
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
comment by the staff uh yeah and maybe
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
this will help clarify when it comes to
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
definitions if there is a statutory
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
definition you have to use that
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
statutory definition but this particular
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
language is not a statutory definition
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the manual later in
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
the manual it does specifically say that
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
when you're doing rules you should be
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
clarifying statutory language not simply
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
repeating statutory language so maybe
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's where the confusion is it's not
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
technically a statutory definition which
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
is where we do encourage you to use the
 
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.190 align:start position:0%
is where we do encourage you to use the
statutory

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
language so we're okay with the first
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
change we're down to the question of of
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
unclear or ambiguous language in the
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
second and the agency is objecting to
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of putting uh including but not
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
limited to type of language to give some
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
guidance to people who would be subject
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.670 align:start position:0%
to this
rule

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
correct so what do we say we we can
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
conditionally we can prove the editorial
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
comments knowing they didn't put a list
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
in or included not included we can um or
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
we going object correct correct you
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
could object or you could um do an
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval which would
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
Encompass their previous conditional
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
approval plus the one that was just
 
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.270 align:start position:0%
approval plus the one that was just
agreed

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
to move second the amended conditional
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
approval has been approved Is there
 
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion motion by
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire seconded by
 
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.829 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire seconded by
representative

00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
Schmidt all those in favor say I I all
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
those oppos nay guys have it thank you
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
very much guys thank you
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
next up is the Public Utilities
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:45.190 align:start position:0%
 
24110

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
I all right so um I there was a
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request on this one
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
and I have no further substantive
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
comments there was also public testimony
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
some of which was received this morning
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
so I've not reviewed all of it um high
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
level the the original testimony was
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
questioning the Chairman's authority to
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
write rules um because the chairman has
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
been giving the authority of
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
219 n g n no
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
G9 and um so as as the the power of a
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
commission is to promate rules um not
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily with the entire commission
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
but the commission was involved in the
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
rul making um and so that testimony was
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
um actually the test the person
 
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
testifying was like the problem has been
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
fixed okay um I don't have any other
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
comments and I think the agency wants to
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
request an oral change to some of the
 
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.990 align:start position:0%
request an oral change to some of the
language

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
great we on
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman uh my name is
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
Mark Delano I'm the uh newest
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the uh New Hampshire
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission uh with me
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
today is uh senior adviser Sarah Fuller
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh who will be giving the presentation
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
on our rules
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
proposal thank you um and just before we
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
start and before I forget it's nice to
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
see you today just as a oral conditional
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
approval request um for rule
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
20217 which which is a definition to
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
position statement um so it now reads
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
the position statement means a legal
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
response to a pleading outlining the
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
respond factual and legal arguments or
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
viewpoints regarding the same um after
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department of energy
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh it was pointed out to me
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we get position statements from
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
non-lawyers so we're going to we're
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
requesting a change of the word legal to
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
written which was attorney Dexter's
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion so it's position statement
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
means a written response to a pleading
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
outlining the responder's factual and
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
legal arguments or viewpoints regarding
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
the same and I think that would
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate um the concern there uh and
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
make the definition more inclusive so
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
that is that is the oral conditional uh
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
request we're making just on that one
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
definition so I'll start
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
there um and then just I'm happy to do
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
this now I'm happy happy to do this um
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
after we hear from our public testimony
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I have reviewed the public testimony
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
from uh the Office of Consumer Advocate
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
joined by The Joint utilities I also
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
reviewed the one very early this morning
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
that came in from the Department of
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
energy um just as a brief background
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
what I'll say is that uh in July of 21
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission was
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
split and so we have what we are now the
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and the
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
um upon the creation of the Department
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
of energy the commission envisioned that
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
updates to its procedural and
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
organizational rules would be
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
forthcoming the PC the puc uh held some
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
initial stakeholder meetings in
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
2022 and then began an ear internal
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
process of how are we going to develop
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
these rules to make sense for our
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
current practice and
 
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
current practice and
procedure

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
um and out of that those discussions
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
came our initial
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
proposal the commission has spent the
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
last seven months working with our
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we have gone in my opinion
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh above and beyond any requirements uh
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
by law to make sure that everybody who
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to be heard was heard um we made
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
multiple changes to the initial proposal
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
we held two public hearings we extended
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
the public comment period multiple times
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
we we reopened the public comment period
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
after we issued a draft final proposal
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh to allow again our stakeholders to be
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
involved um commissioner Delano wasn't
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
there because he was a he wasn't our
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner at that point he was our
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general but uh chairman Dan
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
through another public Hearing in
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
October and then after that public
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
hearing we gave another three weeks for
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
comments in addition to that um I have
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
been available to meet with people um I
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
have spent a lot of time with our
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so I actually think it's a
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
great success that the joint utilities
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
and um the Office of Consumer Advocate
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
have narrowed down their one issue um I
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
will say that I have read their
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
objection and respectfully disagree with
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
it um they have cited gel car rules that
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
involve uh not considering our
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders point of view and not
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
explaining oursel they have cited gel
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
car rules that talk about um violations
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
of statutory authority to support their
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
position and in
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
the the comment is really simple so it's
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
a change to how well it's a perceived
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
change to how the commission reviews
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
settlements in the course of
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
litigation uh and when I say
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
perceived it doesn't
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
change anything the commission has a
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
history in the last 10 years of of
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
receiving settlement agreements
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
reviewing those in the context of
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and then issuing orders there
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
are some cases we adopt the settlement
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
as a whole but there are multiple cases
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
where the settlement has been adopted in
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
whole or in part um I can give examples
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
of those if needed um but what we are
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to codify exactly the
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
procedure that is in place today the
 
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.710 align:start position:0%
procedure that is in place today the
commission

00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes there is RSA 541 a38 which talks
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
about informal disposition by
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
settlement but the commission's
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
authority is granted to it by specific
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and we have RSA 3631 17A
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
which talks about the commission as an
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
Arbiter which is you know the
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
commission's job is to regulate
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
utilities um and to exercise this in a
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
manner uh that's consistent with our
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
statute we have uh RSA 3655 that the
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
commission's responsibility is to
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
provide independent inquiry we have
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
36528 um which is actually a provision
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
that allows us to alter our orders so
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
let's say a settlement agreement was
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
approved in full later it comes before
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
us uh the commission is allowed to alter
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
its final orders as long as there's
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
proper notice to the parties and then
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's RSA
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
3743 which is the extent of our power in
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
that the Public Utilities Commission and
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
the department of energy shall have the
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
general supervision of all Public
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities in the plants owned operated
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
and controlled of I think when combined
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
these statutes that I've enumerated um
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
are balanced against how we how we
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
review settlements and the rules we have
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
provoke we have presented are fair
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
they're reasonable they have considered
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's interest um I am
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that it's uh bounded
 
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that it's uh bounded
that

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
if if these rules are passed as adopted
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
that litigation will Skyrocket I don't
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
think it's founded that you know nobody
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
will want to settle nothing is going to
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
change this is exactly what the
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
commission has been doing for the last
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
10 years when they review settlements so
 
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
that that was in response to the public
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
comment we received from The Office of
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
Consumer advocate in the joint utilities
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
who again I thank very much I've worked
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
very hard with them uh in the last seven
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
months to get these rules from initial
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
proposal to final
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
proposal I saw the public comment from
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy this morning um
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
and although I'm not quite as prepared
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
to speak to it because of when it was
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
received I did speak with the Department
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday um so my initial thoughts
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
are are these the department of energy
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
has stated that we were not supposed to
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
change these rules till
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
2027 uh under 12p and uh I just find
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
that to be um inaccurate I think 12p
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
allows Reliance by the department on
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
commission rules that have not been
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
amended or altered but to think that the
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
commission is going to live with
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
outdated rules of procedure uh for five
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
years or six years uh after the
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
existence of the Department of energy um
 
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate and I will also point out
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
to the fact that the department of
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
energy has been telling jel car that
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
their procedural rules are in the works
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
your uh gel car notes starting back uh
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I didn't go all the way back but
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
starting back in I think the 700s which
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
are water and sewer which we did
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
together um in late 2023 there are notes
 
01:02:16.829 --> 01:02:16.839 align:start position:0%
on those rules that says the department
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
is working on their rul making for their
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
procedural rules so I think it's
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
disingenuous to say they had no intent
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
to put these rules forward until
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
2027 when they have been telling you
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
that they're going to put them forward I
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
would also say there's a there's a
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
response to them on their fiscal impact
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
I don't see how the procedural rules of
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
the commission is going to change the
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
department in regards to legal
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
briefs so the current rule talks about
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
legal briefs being that that is
 
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
requested by the participants the
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
litigation that was written when the
 
01:02:59.549 --> 01:02:59.559 align:start position:0%
commission had staff in the litigation
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
you know the commission used to
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
participate in their own in their own uh
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
cases we do not have staff at least for
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
the year and a half I have been with the
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
commission what happens with legal
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
briefs is the Commissioners are on the
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
bench they need they need further legal
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
understanding on something the
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners say to the participants we
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
would like legal briefing on X Y or Z
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
how much time do you need that is all we
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
tried to do in this rule was to actually
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
codify the actual practice the practice
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
is not that the party is asked to submit
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the brief sometimes they could but the
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
majority of the practice is that we the
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
commission control our litigation and
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
what we need to decide it so that is
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
what we did it is um unrealistic to
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
think that now because the change in
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
this rule that we're going to require
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
legal briefs on every case that that's
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
not a founded that's not founded it's
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
where it's going to continue continue to
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
work exactly the way it is as for um
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
settlements again I I think that the
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
change in settlements is is just to
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
codify what we have done um it's not
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to lead to uh people you know us
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
not accepting settlements uh as I have
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
said in many s like different set
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
settings the commission is a staff of
 
01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:23.950 align:start position:0%
settings the commission is a staff of
three

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners three legal senior
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
advisers two to three technical
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
experts to think that we are now going
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
to hear every case uh in full
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
adjudication is not in what we want to
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
do it's not in our best interest it is
 
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
not what we're planning on doing you
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
know we have a staff of of a total 11
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
that's all of our clerical staff that's
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
everybody the Public Utilities
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
Commission to get the work done and um
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
you know the and how we allocate our
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
resources is up to us and how the
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
department of energy allocates their
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
resources up to them but I don't see
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
that US changing our rules is going to
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
cost the department of energy nearly you
 
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.349 align:start position:0%
cost the department of energy nearly you
know

01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
$650,000 which was in there today so I
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
just would like to reserve some time to
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
respond after the fact if you have any
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
additional questions but the public
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
utility commission's um request today is
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
that you adopt our conditional uh
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
approval as I've just amended to that
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
one um um definition and I appreciate
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
your time today just had a couple of
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
comments um again Mark Delano
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Public Utilities
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
Commission uh just a couple of things to
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
highlight in attorney Fuller's testimony
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh one is um many of the people you're
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
going to hear from today are former puc
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
staff that have been either transferred
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
over to the Department of energy or have
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
since been uh uh appointed as the
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate uh you know these
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
folks they uh were used to a certain um
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
way of handling cases when they were at
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
the Pu and they participated directly in
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
litigation uh the legislature has since
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
changed the law on how that's supposed
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
to work and so you know some of the
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
things that we have seen in some of the
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
comments just seem to be a resistance to
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
that new uh legislative Paradigm where
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know our offices to uh you act as
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
the Arbiter and adjudicator balancing at
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
the same time the interests of the
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
industry with those of the rate base uh
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
the oca's job is to represent the
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers uh the
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh represents the
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
policy interests of the state most of
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do with our rules
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
is to make it clearer how we are
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
expecting our litigants to participate
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
in proceedings before our body uh like
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
any Court uh that requires uh you know
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
legal briefing from parties when a novel
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
issue of laws raised uh the puc uh in
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
the past relied on their staff to inform
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
them of those things well today we as as
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
attorney Fuller pointed out uh we only
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
have a very small number of Staff we
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
have less than 20 people in the office
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the department of energy is 93
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
uh so at the end of the day uh when
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
we're up there there trying to make uh
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
decisions uh and novel issues come up uh
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
we'll going we're going to ask the uh
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
you know the folks that are appearing
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
before us to brief them because one of
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
them has probably brought it up thank
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
you questions from the committee
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative so just to boil all that
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
down I'm going to ask a question are you
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
after has it been decided that the
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
department of energy is going to be the
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
investigator and that the Pu is going to
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
be the
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
adjudicator and that's why you're
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
rules that's a great question um so by
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
Statute um we're changing the rules
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
because uh we have to change the rules
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's many many instances in our
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
current rules that refer to things that
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
are no longer in existence so there were
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
references to commission staff
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding in um dockets there are
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
references to an executive director so
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's where we started um the statutory
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
language is often when it's about
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
investigation it says the Public Utility
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
Commission and the department of energy
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
so we both have duties to investigate we
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
both have duties to regulate um we do
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
them in a different context but the
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
statute uh when it was amended back in
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
2021 very rarely only in the only really
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
in the section um that's coming to mind
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
and I could be corrected by probably all
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the professionals sitting behind me
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh but in the area of customer
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
complaints in that
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
area there and I think that's
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
3654 maybe uh in that area the public
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
utilities uh commission was taken out in
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
the in a process where was put in place
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
for the Department of energy to
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
investigate customer complaints and then
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
only the the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
only gets involved in those on a
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
strictly adjudicative basis uh after the
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy has rendered a
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
decision if the customer is unhappy with
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
that decision they can file for a
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
hearing with us so that is an instance
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
where the authority is very clear and
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
who does what there's many other
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
instances where uh the statutes
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
reference both of us so I I hope that
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
answer your question it does thank you
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
if I could representative Lyn for a
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
question so can I just follow up on that
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
so so am I understanding from what
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
you've said then that there are still a
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
category of cases in which the Pu is
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
both the
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicator and some element of the Pu
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
is acting as an advocate before the Pu
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
no and I and if I and and and if I can
 
01:10:27.149 --> 01:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
it said that all confusing um I
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
apologize the Pu is never acting as an
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
advocate in front of the
 
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
Pu the
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
commiss staff yeah the staff the staff
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
is never we don't have um you know an
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
attorney staff member I'm a senior legal
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
counsel my job is not to to participate
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
in the hearings on other any any way
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
except for helping in the adjudication
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
for answering questions from my
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
um the role of how we look at these
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
adjudications how we participate in
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
these adjudications is one where the
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are tasked by legislation
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
to also regulate they have a duty to um
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
what is to review
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
these if there are settlement cases in a
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
duty of what is just and reasonable and
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the public good so there is an
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
overarching duty to do
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
that and so I hopefully I hope that
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
clears it up if not commissioner Delano
 
01:11:36.669 --> 01:11:36.679 align:start position:0%
can uh can come in
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
too I I'd say representative Lynn that
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
generally speaking uh except for some
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
statutory uh references to a joint Power
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy and the Pu
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
to investigate certain matters uh it's
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
the department of energy that is in that
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
investigatory role uh and uh you know we
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
generally do not uh the best of my
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge and again I've been this is my
 
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:06.250 align:start position:0%
uh fifth day on the job
 
01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
uh fifth day on the job
[Laughter]

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh actually actually participate
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
in those investigations um I do recall
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Fuller discussing with me
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
the process for if a customer complaint
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
comes in and it's heard by energy and
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
they disagree with it that there may be
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
a right of appeal to the uh to the the
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
Pu but um that I wouldn't call that
 
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.270 align:start position:0%
Pu but um that I wouldn't call that
investigatory

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
investigatory
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
so we can open investigative dockets and
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
we do it rarely um and I don't think
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
we've done it since December of
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
20203 I think was the last one was
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
closed on specific matters but that is
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
not an adjudicative docket that is not
 
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
that's not participating in an
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
adjudication in an investigative manner
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
so that that is how we do
 
01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
so that that is how we do
it

01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
representa thank you so I set aside
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
customer complaints because it seems
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
that that's clearly defined as to whose
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
role but others but you did mention that
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
in some cases the department of energy
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
Pu investigate do the investigation and
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
in that case where both of you do the
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
investigation how is the adjudication
 
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.870 align:start position:0%
investigation how is the adjudication
done

01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think in that case we're we're
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
um talking investigation in different uh
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
languages here Department of Energy's
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
role is one of I think the prosecutor
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's you know their their job in the
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
hearing is they represent the state's
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
interest in the policy Wing the
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner's responsibility is to ask
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions at hearing and understand what
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
has been presented to them and to
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
determine whether what has been
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
presented is just and reasonable and in
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
the public good so I don't think that is
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
in the same vein as that as the
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
investigation they do not participate
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
and again if I confused anybody uh I I
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
apologize um they have an oversight
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility they have a regulatory
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility but they're not
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
investigating in in in their in those
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
cases you know if the if the
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners ask
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
questions it is it is to
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh provide answers to help clarify to
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
them what they're being asked to
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
approve so that that's that is
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
difference representative a or Senator a
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
sorry Senator works whatever been there
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for being here uh just I
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
wrote a note just saying nothing is
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
going to change and this was in regards
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
to settlements could you elaborate on
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more because I got to
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
be honest with you as chair of energy
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
confused I said nothing is going to
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
change and I said it in specific
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
reference to the comments we've received
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
so the current
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
rule on
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
settlements and actually it's um it has
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
to do with settlements or default orders
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
and there's another um provision in
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
there um uses the word result the
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
commission will review the results of
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
the settlement um we have changed that
 
01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
to the commission will review the
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of the settlement now that
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
current rule has been in place I think
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
since 2015 maybe and in when I received
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
these responses um we went back and did
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
some a little bit of research so when I
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
look at some of our old dockets um which
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
is well before the split you know we
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
ass uh rate case docket where a
 
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
settlement came in in
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
2017 and the result of that wasn't to
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
accept the whole settlement you know the
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
the result the result of that was um
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
that you know there's a lot of issues
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
going on um
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
and where they were going to reject the
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
they were going to reject the settlement
 
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
and in in part or in whole you know the
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
for gas
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
was a settlement where the revenue
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
requirement was accepted but the terms
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
on um term of time of use and electronic
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and some other things
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
were called out of that settlement so my
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
point of is nothing is going to change
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
because the practice of the PO Utilities
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
Commission for over 10 years has been to
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
do this the practice has been we hear
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
these settlements and we review them and
 
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
we review the provisions of the
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
settlement and we take testimony on
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
those settlements and sometimes these
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
cases in these hearings on the
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
settlements last multiple days now if
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
the commission were to just say okay we
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
can only accept or deny the settlement
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
as whole that is actually going to have
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
the opposite effect if the commission
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have have the ability to review
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the terms of the
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
settlement and to see if they're just
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
and reasonable and had to make an up or
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
down on the whole thing I think you're
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
actually going to have the opposite
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
effect which is you know settlements
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
will be denied
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
because these five things don't
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
work and as a these five things
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
together result in that the result of
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
the settl m is not just and
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable if that the alternative which
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
is what we've proposed is the provisions
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the settlement if there are
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
provisions of the settlement that do not
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
work just as we have done in the last 10
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
years we issue an order that
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
says we
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
approve X Y and Z we adopt X Y and Z
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
regarding a b and c we find for the
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
following reasons that they are not just
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
and reasonable in the public goods
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
and do not accept that now what can the
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
settling parties do in that point right
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
the settling parties all of these
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
settlements have bullet proof um
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
language that says if it is not adopted
 
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.669 align:start position:0%
language that says if it is not adopted
in

01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
whole uh we won't agree so they could
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
file a motion to vacate our orders and
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
come litigate the whole thing that is
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely within their right and they
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
can absolutely do that so when I say
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed this is what we
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
do I mean this is and this is what this
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
is what they have been
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
doing I have a little follow up with
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
that real quick Senator Senator maybe I
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
may I uh a comment additionally to your
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
original question bring down to
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
kindergarten yeah this what I'm going to
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
do so um there seems to be a um a I
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
guess an initiative or a plan to uh you
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
know try to uh position things so that
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
the Pu uh has to accept a settlement by
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh the parties appearing in a rate case
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
so in other words uh they want to treat
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
it like they would civil litigation so
 
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
let's imagine for a moment that uh
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
you're you and uh Senator Lang are in a
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
car accident and uh you know you uh you
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
think he's you you and Senator Lang says
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
sir that you're you're at fault and and
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh so so he decides to sue you and so uh
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know uh it's pending before the
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
spear Court uh if the two of you guys
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
make a uh settlement agreement between
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
yourselves on you know the damages and
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
the liability and you you file that with
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
the court well your case is over why
 
01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
because in that case the judge doesn't
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
have any other responsibility besides
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
being a a neutral in your
 
01:20:19.709 --> 01:20:19.719 align:start position:0%
case here the Pu has obligations that uh
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know judges would only have in cases
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
where perhaps it involves the settlement
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
involving a minor
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
and our the way that our statutory
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
scheme works is that if the utilities
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate Department of
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
energy all these folks come to us and
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
they say we've worked it out and here it
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
is our statutes still require us to
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
examine that settlement and make sure
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
that you know it it properly uh balances
 
01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
the interests of the rate base with the
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
interests of the regulated utility and
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the public good and so uh you
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
may hear corollaries to oh in civil
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
litigation this would just go in and
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's over but here we have an obligation
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond what uh you know per se
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
a judge would do in a uh settlement uh
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
situation involving uh you know ordinary
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
not so let me add a little bit another
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
twist to this then so when I heard the
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker say you know well
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
you know way back when now we have a new
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh would a piece of legislation clarify
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
this this whole situation between who
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
who settles it uh and and because it
 
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's still sounding very
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
complicated uh and and uh and I get your
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
I get what you're saying is Well you
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
know if uh there there are other
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances that you have to look at
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
even though it is settled get it I get
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
it uh I'm not sure the public
 
01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.590 align:start position:0%
it uh I'm not sure the public
understands

01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
understands
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
this to be frank with you so so let me
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
so let me try and address that point
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
because I saw some confus faces out
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
there in the audience as well and there
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
some of the Prof professionals I'm
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
looking at their body language and
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
they're going not sure well and again
 
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
you know I may have an imperfect
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of what of what their
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
proposal around settlement is but uh the
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
way that uh I understand it is that you
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
know there is a a suggestion out there
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
that if pu receives a settlement by the
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
parties pu has to accept that settlement
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
as is and I think to make the public
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
understand it is that in a world where
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh you know the utilities the
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate or Andor the
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
department of energy do some horse trade
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
and they come up with something that
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
they think works for their individual
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
interests uh as whole it might not be it
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
still might not be the best thing for
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
the rate base and our statutory scheme
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
requires that we make that determination
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
as the Pu not
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
allow those parties who are litigant
 
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
before us to come up with a settlement
 
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
and present it to us and say guys you
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
got to rubber stamp
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is that maybe is that does that
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
so Mark I I just want to follow up on
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
this same line of conversation so again
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
um the problem with the Pu is the public
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
good comment right the the overall
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
arching of rate payers State interest
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
everything else um and so I I think the
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
concern we're hearing is that the
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
um the question is whether the
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
proceeding with six items we've agreed
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
to these six things and you you pull out
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
one item go I don't think this is a good
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
item and yet the parties wouldn't agree
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the agreement without that one item
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
and what how's that going to break apart
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
the process and I think whereas before
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
you looked at the when you were saying
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
the results based right all the results
 
01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
of this good for everybody versus every
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
single individual lying being good for
 
01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
everybody um and I can you address that
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
at all I I think that's the concern I I
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
heard when and people were talking about
 
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
was this line by line veto power
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
basically um that allows you to strike
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
up a vision which would totally make a
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
an agency or or an individual say never
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
mind I don't want to do that if you
 
01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
strike that that breaks the whole deal
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
so how does that so to be clear we're
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
not talking about a line item veto kind
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
of situation I think I think what we're
 
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
what we're contemplating is that if if
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
we got that settlement agreement with
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
six items and we found that with all six
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
of those items it's the the agreement is
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
problematic based on the standards that
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
we need to evaluate it under we can go
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
back to the parties and say you know
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
what we're good with the first five the
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
six one we've got a problem with can you
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
renegotiate it can you work on it can
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
you can you come back to us with
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
something that's more feasible those are
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
the kinds of uh you know this the kinds
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
of things that happened in the past um
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
and ultimately we want the parties to be
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
able to settle it in a way that allows
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
the Pu to approve it but that doesn't
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
always happen and when that doesn't
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
happen we need to have the flexibility
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
to you know instruct the parties on what
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
aspects we have problems with versus a
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
just saying not it's denied let's
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
litigate the case and and maybe that is
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
that does that answer your question
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
right anything else from anything to add
 
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.430 align:start position:0%
right anything else from anything to add
to

01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
that no just my only my only add to that
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
is just that the the objection is based
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
on that this doesn't follow
 
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.629 align:start position:0%
on that this doesn't follow
541

01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
541
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
a38 so the objection is is that that
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
this small provision in one of a you
 
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
know this one rule in a 50-page rule set
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
violates 541 838 and that's the informal
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
settlement provision and that if you
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
look at our rules as a
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
whole uh there are multiple places where
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do provide uh settlement instructions
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
we have a whole prehearing process on it
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
we that is built every procedural
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
schedule has settlement built into it
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
and I do not think
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
that we are at all close to violating
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
541 838 given the fact that we have
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
provided for settlements we engage in
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
settlements we encourage settlements and
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
then when you balance that with our own
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
statutes which have to take priority as
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
to how we look at these settlements I
 
01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
just I want to put it back in that that
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
context like what are what is the
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
objection the objection is we are
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
violating the administrative procedures
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
act and and and we are not violating the
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act you know
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
we we have a duty to look at these
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
settlements we have a duty to not just
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
sign these settlements and you know that
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's really just want I want to just
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
bring it back to what is the objection
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
and how and how have we responded so you
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
know I really appreciate all these
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions and I'll tell you I've worked
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
with these parties behind me that might
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
be making faces right now um for the
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
last seven months and it's in I don't
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
often get to engage with my stakeholders
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
that much given my role with the
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
commission it's been um enjoyable it has
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
been sometimes frustrating uh and for
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
the most part we've really worked very
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
hard um I think they would all tell you
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
that uh there are multiple multiple
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
multiple Provisions in our conditional
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
approval request that they authored
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
that they suggested that they put
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
forward we have
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
removed multiple things because that is
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
what they asked us to do so if and if
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
you compared the initial and you
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
compared the conditional you would see
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
that um and you know in my opinion this
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
final conditional approval is very much
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
um a reasonable compromise and that
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
there's no violations you know I there
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're there there is no violations we
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
have it's not that our public
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
stakeholders you know we have to adopt
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
everything they say we have to you know
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
by Jael car rule we have to listen and
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
we have to explain and I think we have
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
listened and we have explained thank you
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so we have three more speakers
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
on this still so next up is the
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
energy uh Marie and Paul
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
chairman if I could jump in for a second
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
I um just wanted to address uh rul
 
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
making by the department of energy they
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
have uh put forward um some procedure of
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
rules however there's only one section
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
in that proposal and that's the waiver
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
of rule section so other words their
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
General requirements for procedures they
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't have anything so the only thing
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
they put forward is the waiver of rules
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that was the
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
primary rule set that they were relying
 
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
on for um the Pu rule they were mostly
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%

in pu's um Ru making 200 uh Ru making
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
process before I get to the few
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
remaining concerns that we want to share
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
with the committee the concerns are
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
outlined in the letter we provided to
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday this has been an arduous
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
process and it feels like no stone has
 
01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.229 align:start position:0%
process and it feels like no stone has
gone

01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
unturned we are thankful to the Pu for
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
considering comments received um
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
addressing the many concerns um the
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
department raised following each version
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
of the rules and making changes
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
throughout these past 7
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
months there have been two public
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
comment hearings and the department
 
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
appeared at and um which the department
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
appeared at and Then followed up with
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
lengthy written
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
comments the department prioritizes
 
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
commentary between sister agencies and
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
balances that with uh reviewing the
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
processes and procedures that affect the
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
Department's particip
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
ipation in proceedings before the
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
Pu upon review of the conditional
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
approval request um the department notes
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh a few significant changes that are a
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
departure from the current rules and
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
implications um as as was just discussed
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
um prior the Office of Consumer Advocate
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the joint utilities
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
have shared a letter filed with gelgar
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
that discusses one of the points that we
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
made in our letter the changes discussed
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
in that letter um relate to pu 20410 B
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
um specifically The pu's Proposal
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
requires the Pu to determine that each
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
provision of a settlement agreement
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
meets the statutory requirements um and
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
that replaces the requirement that pu
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
determin that the result of a settlement
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
agreement meets those
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
requirements the department
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
independently from the OCA and and
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities analyzed this um as
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
problematic and agrees with OCA and the
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
joint utilities that the pu's proposal
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the principles of RSA 541
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
a38 that the proposal would impede
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
settlements cause the department to have
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
to prepare for hearing to defend
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
provisions and in so doing create cause
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
costs the department has analyzed that
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
fewer settlements would require an
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
additional analyst um in each of the
 
01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:03.430 align:start position:0%
additional analyst um in each of the
regulatory

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
divisions for each division in its
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory section comprising water
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
electric and gas the department foresees
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
um the need for up to one additional
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
staff person as well as up two two
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
additional Attorneys at an estimated
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
total annual cost of up to $675,000
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
if this change together with the changes
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
to the brief section um I'll discuss
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
next is
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
enacted um relative to the requirement
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
of briefs um at pu uh 20419 rather than
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the allowance of briefs the Pu could
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
essentially order a legal brief in each
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
proceeding if it goes that far there are
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
cost implications as analyzed by the
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
department the department recommends
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
that the language of the underlying
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
rules um in those sections be
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
maintained there is no reason to change
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
language that historically has
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
worked other items raised in our letter
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
pertain to the revision to the
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
definition of position statement at pu
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
20217 which attorney Fuller stated was
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to be um amended in an amended um
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request um and a
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
change at 203 um 18 regarding the
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
identification by the commission
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
um by commission um of uh the commission
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
information requests responses to be
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
relied on in final decisions or their
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
reasoning so that parties have an
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bolster or rebut those
 
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
facts um and that's all we have uh for
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
um opening comments happy to take
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you questions
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative ly thank you so
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I guess I'm a little bit um
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
concerned because it seems like we have
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
two agencies of the executive branch of
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
government that aren't able to agree on
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
what a rule should be and I guess what
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the thing that I'm troubled by is
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
you now are asking this Committee of the
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
legislature to resolve
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
that it and that seems to me that's much
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
different than where you know the PRI a
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
private party have asking the
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to resolve something if they
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
have a dispute with proposed regulations
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
by by um an administrative agency so the
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
thing I'm I guess I'm concerned about is
 
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.229 align:start position:0%
thing I'm I guess I'm concerned about is
why

01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
haven't why hasn't the department of
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
energy and the Public Utilities
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
Commission gone and sat down with
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
somebody at the Attorney General's
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
office for example and come up with the
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
the executive Branch's position on this
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
instead we have you know this arm of the
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
executive branch says hey and this arm
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch says b and you
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
want us to resolve it my
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
inclination personally I don't know what
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
my college would say would be to say
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
listen you guys in the executive branch
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
Work It Out Among yourselves and when
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
you do come to us and and will then hear
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
from the public and if there's and we'll
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
make a decision but why should we
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
dispute SM just to say that yes we've
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
we've reached an impass we want to um
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
provide the information to the committee
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
um that's uh we we've worked um on these
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
rules for seven months and this this is
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
an impass uh we want to give the
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
information to the committee and that's
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
why we're here
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
today that's the point I wanted to make
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
is that our purpose today is to point
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
out that we have raised concerns with
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
these two particular settlements that we
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
believe will have uh an effect on the
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
workload that the Department of energy
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
has to do and therefore the Personnel
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
that'll be needed to do that workload we
 
01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to quantify that for the
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
commission today which we've done for
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
the committee today which we've done um
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I would go back to what
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
attorney Fuller said from the from the
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
Pu uh we have worked hard uh with uh the
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
Pu to go from uh a rule set that was
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
proposed seven months ago to uh
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
basically have focused in on these two
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
issues and where the the reason we're
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
focusing on those two issues today is
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
because of the potential for the
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
resources I'm going to follow up the
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
question so again so the two issues you
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
have are the change from results to
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
Provisions is that that's the first one
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
we're arguing about yes all right and
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
the second one is around the brief
 
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
section I I want to ask a question
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
around the brief section yes that's
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay so
 
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
20419 says the commission shall require
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
parties to submit briefs at any point in
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
the proceeding if the commission
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
determines that such briefing would
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
assist the Commissioners in determining
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh determination of the legal issues
 
01:38:02.199 --> 01:38:03.589 align:start position:0%
uh determination of the legal issues
being

01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
presented and you object to that you
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
don't think they should be able to allow
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
if you're presenting a legal point they
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
should be able to ask you to clarify or
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
expand and give them a brief on that
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
issue no not at all uh I think the
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
the the we're here to point out that if
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
the if that rule is adopted that there
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
will be a need for for additional
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
resources at the department uh we can't
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
predict uh right now we under the
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
existing rule where the parties that
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
appear before the commission can request
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh the authority to submit briefs we
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
have some control over that uh and it's
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
in practice it's done infrequently a
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
small percentage of the cases that go
 
01:38:49.709 --> 01:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
before the commission result in in in
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
briefing um if the commission requires
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
legal briefs in a lot of proceedings or
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
all proceedings or all the big
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings there's going to be a
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
significant shift in the workload that
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
the Department's going to have to do
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
that's our primary point I don't
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
question that the department sorry that
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
the commission has the authority to do
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
that under their statutes obviously they
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
get to run the hearings the way they
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
like but we just want to point out the
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
fact that there's going to be a s
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
potential for a significant impact uh if
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh the commission is now enshrine that
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
Authority in their rules and uses the
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
authority uh I I did this type of work
 
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts for years and it's not
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
uncommon to see briefs at the end of
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
cases multiple hundreds of pages issue
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
by issue item by item and it's an
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
expensive process what happens before
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
the Public Utility Commission in New
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently is in most instances
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
A party's closing arguments are done
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
orally before the commission uh there's
 
01:39:52.270 --> 01:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
obviously some prep time involved but
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
those closing arguments Run 10 to 15
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
minutes sometimes in a very complicated
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
case might go 30 to 60 minutes that's an
 
01:40:02.669 --> 01:40:02.679 align:start position:0%
entire different situation than reducing
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
all those arguments to a legal brief uh
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's just a a different level of
 
01:40:07.679 --> 01:40:09.030 align:start position:0%
it's just a a different level of
workload

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
workload
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay just just real quickly uh so would
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
would I be out of line by saying if we
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
adopt these rules as is that they would
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's just adding another layer of
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy to these
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
settlements to the settlement no the I
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
was talking about briefs settlement is a
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
different issue um and I don't think I
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
would characterize it as that our
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
position on the um on the issue of
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
settlement is changing the way uh
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
parties prepare a settlement and the way
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
the commission views the settlement and
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we went through that before
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
results versus Provisions so I won't
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
now any further
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir would like the
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
language of the changed role that we're
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of the
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
settlement because I have the old role
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
the current role and the proposed role
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you guys we're going to
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
oh and I guess Don's going to join him
 
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
which means I got two speakers knocked
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
out of the way yes Mr chairman I was
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
hoping that you would grant me and M
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
kavara leave to appear jointly and I'm
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
thinking that's going to help move this

01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh Jessica Kar I represent
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
Public Service Company of New Hampshire
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
that does business as eversource energy
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
and uh obviously the utilities filed
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
joint comments with the office of the
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate on the issue of
 
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
settlements so oh I'm sorry to interrupt
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to point out to the
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee what an extraordinary
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
Confluence this is it's not the consumer
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
Advocate and the state's utilities agree
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
more than you might think but we are
 
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
typically adversaries before the Public
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and so it is a bit
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
noteworthy that we're here uh jointly
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
appearing before the Jael card and I
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
just want you to take note of that I I
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
also want to thank the Pu uh Miss Fuller
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
gave you a lengthy recitation of all the
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
efforts that that agency is undertaken
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
over the last few months to hear the
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
concerns of parties and I know they've
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
heard the concerns of my office we
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
submitted I don't know something like 40
 
01:43:04.109 --> 01:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
pages of comments on their initial
 
01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
proposal back in the summer and we've
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
boiled those concerns down to the one
 
01:43:11.709 --> 01:43:11.719 align:start position:0%
issue in the letter that we filed with
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
the joint utilities that that's a big
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
deal and as Miss Fuller explained to you
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of the concerns that the
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
parties and certainly a lot of the
 
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that I interposed have been
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed addressed in the
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
final proposal uh that has before you
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
and I I know because I've heard from
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
others that Miss Fuller reached out to
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities and to the department
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
affirmatively over the last two weeks
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot of contact
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
amongst that group of stakeholders and I
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
I know those stakeholders are are
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
grateful for that I I also want to say
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
that I was a little disappointed to hear
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
hints of disregard for the experience of
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
those of us who have practiced before or
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
been employed by the Public Utilities
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
Commission over the years I first went
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
to work for the puc in 1999 I worked
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
there for 9 years the last time the
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
puc's procedural rules were
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensively revised was 2007 and I
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
was the general counsel of the agency so
 
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
I had the job of representing the agency
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
before this body and we had similar
 
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
conversations then then in
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
2021 via House Bill 2 the Budget Trailer
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
Bill the department of energy was
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
created sort of CED off from the Pu and
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
I I was a big supporter of that
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
initiative one of the reasons that I was
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
a big supporter of that initiative is
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
that it was openly acknowledged at the
 
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
time that doing that changing state
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
government to that degree was a big deal
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
that was being accomplished imperfectly
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
via the trailer bill and the expectation
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
was that through processes like this one
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
we would work through some of the
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
details that left that were left on
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
resolved at that time and so in a sense
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we're uh busy doing here
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
resolving those imperfections frankly
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
some of those imperfections and this
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
goes to questions from Senator avard and
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn some of those
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
questions are going to have to be
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
resolved by legislation uh I I concluded
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
and I think other parties did too that
 
01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
what the what the Pu is proposing here
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
reflect colorable interpretations of
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
their enabling legislation as it's been
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
revised and so to the extent further
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
revision is required it isn't fair to
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
ask you to deal with that we're going to
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
go and ask the uh subject matter
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
Committees of the legislature to deal
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
with those questions um I I also want to
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
say as the consumer Advocate that I am
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about things that
 
01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%
drive up the cost of having utility
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
regulation in this state and there's a
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward reason why that
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
is every last cent of the cost of
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
utility regulation in New Hampshire is
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
taxed taxed to the state's rate payers
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
so when the process becomes needlessly
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
complicated or difficult or challenging
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
rate payers pay we're we're the only
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
wallet in the room as I'm I'm fond of
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
saying so given all of that we've boiled
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
our concerns down to this one provision
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the rules that has to do with the way
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
the puc handles
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
settlements and I I guess what I want to
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
have what I want to say about that is
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
that if if in in fact nothing is
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
changing about the
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
pu's method for dealing with settlements
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
that are presented to it then I don't
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
understand and I don't think you should
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand why the Pu needs to change
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
the language of its rule um I I think
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
what the Pu is trying to do here is
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
codifying a existing practice or a habit
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
that has crept up in recent years which
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
is to pick a heart settlements to a
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
degree that it has not before now I do
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
not suggest to you that the Pu doesn't
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
have its own independent authority to
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at settlement agreements
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
that are presented to it and not simply
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
do what the Superior Court would do uh
 
01:47:11.709 --> 01:47:11.719 align:start position:0%
in in in approving a settlement of a
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
routine uh bit of civil litigation the
 
01:47:17.589 --> 01:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
Pu does have overarching authority to
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
assess settlement agreements to make
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
sure that they're lawful and serve the
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
public interest but what isn't helpful
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
is when the Pu goes line by line or
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
provision by provision from settlement
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
agreements and Cherry picks them even
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
worse is when the Pu simply ignores
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements which is exactly
 
01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
what they did back in mid November when
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
they decided the big uh net metering
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
case stock at
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
22060 that is pending before the
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
commission so that is the issue that we
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
are raising here with you today now miss
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
kavara can address this on on behalf of
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
the utilities from my perspective as
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate I can't enter into
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements anymore because I
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
have no Assurance representative Lynn
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
will appreciate this when an attorney
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
sits down to negotiate a settlement
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
agreement she or he does that by
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
assessing litigation risk you know how
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
does my proposed resolution of this case
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
compare with what I think the tribunal's
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
likely resolution of the case is going
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
to be when I can't do that assessment
 
01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
because I think the tribunal is going to
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
just pick apart every little provision
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
of the settlement agreement then I can't
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
assess the litigation risk I can't sign
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements and therefore I
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
have to bring every single issue on a
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
contested basis before the tribunal
 
01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
that's the situation I find myself in
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
right now as consumer Advocate that's
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
why from my perspective I think that the
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
objection we have interposed is um a
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable one that you should take very
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
seriously I just want to make one little
 
01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
comment about something that isn't in
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
our letter and it has to do with the
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
issue the department has raised which
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
has to do with briefs um I I learned in
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
law school that litigation whether it
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
happens in court or before an
 
01:49:11.709 --> 01:49:11.719 align:start position:0%
administrative tribunal is an attorney
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
driven process in that it's my job as an
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
attorney representing a client before
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
the Pu or before a court to decide how
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
and what I want to say to the Tribunal
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
by way of legal argument and developing
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
factual evidence and that sort of thing
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
so I've always understood uh briefing to
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for me as an attorney
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
to raise arguments I've never understood
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
it to be a requirement obviously if I'm
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
given a briefing opportunity and I
 
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
failed to use it or I failed to use it
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
adequately that's on me but I've never
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
seen a tribunal before reserve the
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
authority to require me to submit a
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
brief particularly at any time in the
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
process that's that is something that
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
you should think about the idea that the
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
Pu can just at any point when it occurs
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
to it it can tell parties to submit
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
briefs now I I'm I'm less concerned
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
about that than the department is
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
because I I really think that for the
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
finish the Pu can't really require a
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
party to submit a brief I mean we'll
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
have to test that we'll see the first
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
time I lose a case because I didn't
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
submit a brief when the Pu told me to
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
then I'll go before chief justice
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
McDonald and his colleagues and we'll
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
see uh how they think about that but I I
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
I I I I hear the concern of the
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
department about that less worried about
 
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
it than they are my concern has to do
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
with the settlement provision in the
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
proposed rules and now I will let Miss
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
kavara talk to you on behalf of the
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
utilities thank
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you attorney cre uh my
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
comments will be relatively brief um
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
attorney Cree covered a lot of of the uh
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
points that I was going to make I I
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that there is a lot of
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
what attorney Fuller said that I I do
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
agree with including the efforts that
 
01:50:59.069 --> 01:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
went into these roles and the
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
collaboration that that was extended uh
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the utilities to resolve issues right
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
up into the last minute um and and
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
that's very much appreciated um I I I do
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
want to make some points uh I think
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
something was referenced about uh
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
parties seeking a rubber stamp of
 
01:51:19.069 --> 01:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
settlements that that is not what we're
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
seeking um when parties enter into
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements they are doing so
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
knowing that the standard is that it
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
should be just and reasonable in the
 
01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
public interest but it should also be
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
evaluated such that it is the overall
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
result of the settlement that would be
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable and in the public
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
interest by changing the standard to the
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
provisions of the settlement needing to
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
be just and reasonable and in the public
 
01:51:47.709 --> 01:51:47.719 align:start position:0%
interest I understand that the Pu said
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
today it's not their intention for take
 
01:51:52.069 --> 01:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
cases to be litigated but if the
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
practical fact is as attorney C just
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
said that he's not going to take the
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
risk of entering into settlement
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
negotiations if the doe decides they're
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
not going to engage in the risk of
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
entering into settlement negotiations
 
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
because they will just end up having to
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
incur the cost of litigation anyways the
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
utilities won't have anyone to bargain
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
with and there there may be also
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
interveners to the case but without the
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
de without the doe and the OCA there
 
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
those are two very important voices and
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
so even if it's not their intent the
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
practical effect will be an extreme
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the ability of
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
parties to negotiate settlement and it's
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
that practical effect that we're
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
concerned with but when we do put when
 
01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
parties come together often very diverse
 
01:52:39.149 --> 01:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
parties with very diverse interests if
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
we can come together on all the issues
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
in a docket and put forward a cohesive
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
hole that says this resolves every issue
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
in this docket and the result of it is
 
01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
just and
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable I I I don't think it's
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily appropriate to subject that
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
line by line and look at every element
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
in isolation because that it's it's an
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
anema to to Settlements a the concept of
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
settlements as a whole uh because it it
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
it does it fails to look at that hole
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
and so that that's really all I have to
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
say and I'm I'm happy to take
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions question representative Le I
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
have question really for the consumer
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
Advocate if if I'm understanding
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
that even under the existing
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
rule you're troubled by the way the Pu
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
is now acting in sort of uh really fly
 
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
specking or really nitpicking settlement
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
agreements and not approving them so I
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
guess my question is really if they're
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
doing it now under the existing rule um
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
if we I mean what's the you know why
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't we just leave the existing rule
 
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
the way it is and they'll and if you
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
have a problem you'll I guess you'll
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
litigate it at some point but I I don't
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't quite understand what
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
you're worried about if they're already
 
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
doing under the existing rule what you
 
01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.709 align:start position:0%
doing under the existing rule what you
don't

01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
like that's an excellent question so
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking that
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
and so here here's the reality the the
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
Pu has always engaged in some degree of
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
cherry picking settlements and and
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
usually or historically the cherry
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
picking has involved deciding that oops
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate and the Pu staff
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
now the department of energy they didn't
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
even go far enough so we're going to
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
impose some additional conditions on
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
whatever utility is before the
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission and then given the way the
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
rules and given the way uh settlements
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
are always structured it really became
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
the job of the utility to decide am I
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to just swallow this
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
or am I going to litigate this and the
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
utility every time I had ever seen that
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
happen decided all right we'll go along
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
with it we'll we'll take the additional
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
haircut imposed by the regulator and
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
everybody lives happily ever after uh I
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
if you change the rule to make it even
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
more consistent with the rule uh that
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
the Pu can cherry pick settlements then
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
this process gets even more difficult in
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
the way that I've articulated I if I'm
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're saying is this
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
will just sort of En changing the
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
language will encourage them to do it
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
even more yes that that is what I'm
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
saying and and what I would also ask you
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
to think about is in a scenario where
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
you have the consumer Advocate
 
01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
representing residential rate payers the
 
01:55:40.830 --> 01:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy representing the
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
executive branch and its plenary
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
authority over the you know the the the
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
general good of the state whatever
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
utility or utilities are involved and
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
whatever other parties have chosen to
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
intervene when you have all of those
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
parties coming before the Pu and saying
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
here's the answer here is a reasonable
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
compromise of all these issues I mean
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
yes the Pu has some independent
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
authority to uh assess whether that all
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
is in the public interest but what does
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
the Pu add to that consensus when it
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
includes all of the parties whose
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
interests the Pu could conceivably be
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
expected to resolve now remember
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
attorney Fuller told you the pu's
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
statutory job is to serve as the Arbiter
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
between the interests of utility
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
shareholders and the interests of
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
utility customers it is a big deal when
 
01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
the Pu tells us and you that it knows
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
better than what the shareholders and
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
to questions from the committee would
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
you like your options uh yeah actually
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
just want to ask I have a question I do
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
want my options but um I have a question
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
so uh Mr gree if a provision if a
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
settlement was put forward that had one
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
of the things I'm reading is that the
 
01:57:05.229 --> 01:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
agreement that the provisions of the
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
settlement are consistent with the
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
applicable law right so let's just use
 
01:57:11.069 --> 01:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
criteria if all those parties got
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
together and put together a proposal for
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
a settlement that wasn't appropriate to
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
the application of law that was in
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
violation of the application of law
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be appropriate for the Pu to
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
reject that provision just on that
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.870 --> 01:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
yes I wonder if I could just ask a
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
question to the staff am am I
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the the change in
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
the language on the settlement aspect is
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
from reviewing the results of the
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
settlement to reviewing the provisions
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
of the settlement or is it more
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
complicated so it's slightly more
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
complicated so the original rule is was
 
01:57:53.159 --> 01:57:53.910 align:start position:0%
complicated so the original rule is was
uh

01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
20320 B and it reads the commission
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
shall approve a disposition of any
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
contested Case by stipulation settlement
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
consent or order or default it if it
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
determines that the result is just and
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable and serves the public
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
interest the proposed rule reads it's
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
20410 B it's on page 43 of the
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
conditional approval packet and it reads
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
the commission shall approve a
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
disposition of any cont contested Case
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
by settlement agreement if it is
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
determined that provisions of the
 
01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:30.679 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement are consistent with
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
the applic law are just and reasonable
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
and serve the public interest so they've
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
changed the the language from the result
 
01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:41.069 align:start position:0%
changed the the language from the result
to

01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
Provisions my analysis is that it
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that much but it clearly
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
people are are disagreeing with that
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
so thank thank you that's that's very
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
helpful so want you give us our options
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
here so uh jel car at this point can
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
either approve the rule you can object
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
to the rule on the basis of pu 20410 B
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
which is the one I just read um or you
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
could postpone um the tenative January
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
meeting is the 17th and your deadline is
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
21st uh
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
s uh object to
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
2041b okay
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
question on
 
01:59:26.589 --> 01:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
procedure is represent is Senator avar
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
was he seated yes oh I I apologize I
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
apologize so soar you're you're so to do
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
a preliminary objection which is what
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
you're asking to do we we have to give a
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
reason so what's the reason for the
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection so they can
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
respond I think it just complicates
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
things and I'm going to narrow it down
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
to just more bureaucracy sorry so my
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the objection is
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
to 20410 B um because the language is uh
 
01:59:59.229 --> 01:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
unclear and unable to be enforced
 
02:00:01.470 --> 02:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
uniformally thank you okay you're very
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
good at this all right so Senator avars
 
02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
made a motion to a preliminary objection
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
based on uh
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and has been seconded by
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Andis which I think was also
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
seated so all five Senators here there
 
02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yeah I guess I
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
would say I'm I'm going to vote to you
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
know consistent with with the with the
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection but I have to say
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of of the language
 
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's been read but I really agree with
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
the staff that I don't really see much
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
if any substantive difference here
 
02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
between the language and
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
um so for that I mean for that reason
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe it doesn't it we should
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
just leave the language the way it is it
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like though from what the
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate has said I I think his
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
testimony was very helpful that maybe
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
there is a problem with the
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
Pu uh sort of nitpicking uh settlements
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
that that and that may or I'm not I
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that's true or not
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
but if it but if it is I'm not sure that
 
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
anything that we would do here would
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
make much of a difference but I so for
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm gonna I'm going to
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
support U Senator aar's motion to
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
clarify also the preliminary objection
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
does give the agency the chance to go
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
back and talk to stakeholders and make
 
02:01:21.390 --> 02:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
and they can make no change and keep it
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
the way it is or they can make a change
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe they can come up with better
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
language it just gives them more time to
 
02:01:29.709 --> 02:01:29.719 align:start position:0%
do that so we will see the
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
result so again the motion is a you have
 
02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
a comment yes thank you Mr chair I'm uh
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative L that it's
 
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
distressing that we've got three
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
agencies here fighting it out this is
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
not the proper venue for such a uh for
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
such an action and I hope that by
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
objecting you'll be able to clarify the
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
language so that you all understand what
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
it means thank
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor of the
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection say I I all those
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
it next up is higher
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
education uh scholarships for Orphans
 
02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
-19 okay there are no substantive
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
comments on this proposal we wanted it
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
on the regular agenda to bring up the
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
FIS the fiscal impact statement issue so
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be inadequate because
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
it didn't State all of the cost and
 
02:02:42.069 --> 02:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
benefits to Citizens or independently
 
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
owned businesses so the Department's
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
request for FAL impact statement did
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
bring up these these benefits and costs
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
but the the LBA did not follow that
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
through and put that in the fiscal
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
impact statement which is a concern for
 
02:02:59.709 --> 02:02:59.719 align:start position:0%
us we've seen some inconsistencies with
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
the lb's F's but we just wanted to point
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
out that there are benefits to Citizens
 
02:03:09.069 --> 02:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
and independently own businesses as the
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship funds amounts are changing
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
and so that would cause a benefit which
 
02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
again the the agency pointed out the LBA
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
did not so great go ahead guys good
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
morning Steve division director
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um this
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund has existed for many
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
years the legislature appropriates
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
$10,000 a year um to uh potential
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
individuals with a maximum of $2,500 per
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
award um this rule update the rule was
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
expiring we proceeded to uh work with
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
legal counsel at the department to
 
02:03:46.549 --> 02:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
update the rule which is the proposal
 
02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
you have before you um probably the
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
biggest change would be we brought the
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
rule back in compliance with the
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
statutory language uh the previous rule
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
that was expiring limited this statute
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
to students attending our public
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
colleges and the statute doesn't say
 
02:04:07.229 --> 02:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
that it just says colleges so we've um
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
moved back to that language so that uh
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
potentially a student attending one of
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
our private colleges or universities
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
could uh apply for this which is uh you
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
know affects the fiscal impact uh to
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%

approval on this text and I have no

further substantive comments um there
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
has been a lot of public
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
testimony I can say that the rule itself
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
as it's written um does comply with the
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
statute 317
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
a12 um some of the testimony raised an
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
issue of essentially there's a section
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
they or There are rules that they feel
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
are left out in terms of an emergency
 
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
situation um but the text of the rule
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
does comply with the statute and that is
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
long time with the most concentrated
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%

public session of their meeting and
 
02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:33.559 align:start position:0%
heard more from lenses about these rules

they made last minute adjustments to the
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
final proposal after considering the

02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
the final proposal I'm trying to
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
emphasize the board's efforts to comply
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
with all relevant law while also
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
considering the expertise of New
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oral health professionals as
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
well as nationally Rec recognized
 
02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
standards no set of rules is perfect but
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
at some point they need to move forward
 
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
here the board voted to move these rules
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
forward for your consideration knowing
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
there is a substantial there is
 
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
substantial protest from some New
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oral health professionals
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
knowing this the board voted at their
 
02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
December meeting to request rulemaking
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
support from the office so when these
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
rules are adopted the board can
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
immediately initiate rulemaking to make
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
potential amendments to den
 
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
304 the respected oral health
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
professionals in New Hampshire will have
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
another bite at the anesthesia apple as
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
soon as bureaucracy
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
you questions I think we're have two
 
02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
board members come up to speak to the
 
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
application of the rule versus just the
 
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:44.830 align:start position:0%
application of the rule versus just the
rule

02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
itself represent LE thank you Mr
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um I do have a question about
 
02:09:52.549 --> 02:09:52.559 align:start position:0%
where the authority for separating out
 
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
Children eight and under from 13 and
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
under comes from because in my reading
 
02:09:58.350 --> 02:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the statute there's no separate
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
differentiation between those age
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
groups I would um prefer to defer to the
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh experts here but my understanding is
 
02:10:08.189 --> 02:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
it is a it is
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
a guideline um under the national
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
standards or nationally accepted
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
standards uh to separate out
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think I'll have a Dr AEL or Dr I
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
moment so the stature is um so let me
 
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
introduce myself I'm Dr lington and this
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
is Dr Abel one second doc me uh attorney
 
02:10:43.229 --> 02:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
respond the statute is uh
 
02:10:50.549 --> 02:10:50.559 align:start position:0%
317a 12 and it is Roman numeral uh 12- a
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's G or H H um so the patients under
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
age 13 shall be subject to additional
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
rules including and then there's there's
 
02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
more criteria and so our interpretation
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
was that they set the line at 13 but
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
allowed them to write rules regarding
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
the different sections 0 through 8 to 9
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
through 13 does that make
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
sense um it does you're you're allowing
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
them to give more granularity um than
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
what is specifically laid out and I
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
understand I understand that choice I
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
says Dr lton go introduce your we are
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
can you introduce both of you yes I'm Dr
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
Lon I'm Dr AEL I'm an oral surgeon I
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm an endid and I practice
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
um both Dr Abel and I are here for the
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
um betterment of the p people of New
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the children of New
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's who we're really
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
representing uh we went through a lot of
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
literature and realized that we wanted
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
to find an age that had the least amount
 
02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
of impact on access to care but was the
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
safest approach to
 
02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
Children uh we came up with nine after
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
doing that and um it seemed as though
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
physiologically um it's a lot easier to
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
treat someone over nine in that setting
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
than it is under nine so that was how
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
the age was pecked so that we compromis
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
the uh access to care as well as the
 
02:12:31.149 --> 02:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
safety of the
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
seconde go ahead
 
02:12:41.790 --> 02:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
sir I mean I I agree with everything Dr
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
lington just
 
02:12:46.549 --> 02:12:46.559 align:start position:0%
said okay
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
great uh represent sen
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
um my question is on the specificity
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
between ages 8 and ages
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
13 uh Pals covers eight and under
 
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
generally many of the treatments are
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
weight weight dosed or weight
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
dependent versus age dependent but
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
generally Pal's guidelines are applied
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
eight and under so in these rules 30
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
30407 a8a removes the ACLS requirement
 
02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
under the age of 13 so what do you do
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
between ages 8 and 13 if we pass these
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
rules maybe that's a question for for
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
somebody else but in your in your view I
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
think I I heard you mention age nine
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
actually you're specifically referring
 
02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
to a requirement for ACLS yeah correct
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
what's your opinion on that okay well um
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
there's three types of permits that are
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
permitted for providers and the permit
 
02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
for general anesthesia deep sedation
 
02:13:55.709 --> 02:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
would require ACLS and Pals because they
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
can give it to any age from zero up to
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
know 100 um the the moderate sedation
 
02:14:06.669 --> 02:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
permits um if it's 13 and above they
 
02:14:09.069 --> 02:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
have to have ACLS if it's nine and above
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
because there's a pediatric moderate
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
permit they'd have to have Pals and ACLS
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
so the proposed rules remove the ACLS
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
requirement for under the age of 13 and
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
require Pals only
 
02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
but Pal's guidelines generally apply up
 
02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
to the age of
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
eight and you treat patients over the
 
02:14:30.189 --> 02:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
age of eight under emergency Cardiac
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
Care guidelines taught through
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
ACLS right so there's a gap so the rules
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
as proposed are potentially flawed I
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
mean there are times where your clinical
 
02:14:46.109 --> 02:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
assessment has you
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
treat patients under the age of eight
 
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
because of their weight or size or your
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
clinical judgment judement you'll treat
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
them under ACLS guidelines even if
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're under eight or under Pal's
 
02:14:58.830 --> 02:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines if they're over eight weight
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
do I mean you understand the clinical
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
judgment involved yes and you're from
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester so you certainly remember the
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
tragic case that occurred at an oral
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
surgeon's office in Manchester where
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
there was a lack of ACLS and that
 
02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:16.549 align:start position:0%
there was a lack of ACLS and that
patient

02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
died yes I I apologize Senator I think
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
there may be a misunderstanding of the
 
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
rules do you mind if I go through them
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
um so U there is a requirement for Pals
 
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
and ACLS if you look at uh section Den
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
permitting no I'm I'm familiar but in
 
02:15:45.069 --> 02:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
these proposed rules that ACLS
 
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
requirement is
 
02:15:48.669 --> 02:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
removed where where do you see that
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
132 uh it it removes it for Pediatric
 
02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:07.559 align:start position:0%
patients under
 
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
13 do do you have the specific rule
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
number I apologize Ru number uh
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
304 304
 
02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
304 304
what

02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
8 okay so it it just creates a bit of a
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
gap okay okay between eight and 13 and
 
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
and potentially elsewhere if there's a
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
certain clinical case so that was a
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
response to feedback we got from um
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
various uh providers the qualified
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
provider is going to be your anesthesia
 
02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
provider so if you look at the
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
definitions in the beginning the
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
qualified provider could be a dentist
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
who has a general anesthesia deep
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
sedation permit it could be a medical
 
02:16:53.549 --> 02:16:53.559 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist or it could be a nurse
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
um anesthetist this uh eight that you're
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
referring to is saying the second person
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
so you already have that
 
02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist the second person is
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to be your dentist who's doing the
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
filling or extraction or whatever the
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
procedure is that's the person who is
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay to have BLS because they're like
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
will okay I follow you but you you
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
really can't care
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
for in an emergency Cardiac Care
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
situation uh ACLS and Pals teaches you
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a team approach right the
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
whole course is based on a team approach
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
and and the very
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
first part of either of those curricula
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
is you can't do this alone it's the
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
first and last thing you
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
teach is you can't do it alone in fact
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
they teach it takes a minimum of three
 
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
and preferably six
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
for American Heart Association
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines for either ACLS or Pals and I
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
know you know that because I'm sure
 
02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
you're ACLS or Pal certified yes yes uh
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
Senator I so so the decision is just um
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know with access to care if you will
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
so we're if we do that you know if we do
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're proposing then
 
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
every dentist who wants to bring in an
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist whether they're doing a
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
filling or whatever procedure would have
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
to have a ACS and that is the vast
 
02:18:25.309 --> 02:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
majority of dentists in New Hampshire do
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
not have ACLS unless they're anesthesia
 
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
training that's for oral Conscious
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
Sedation you're talking about right in
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
in the dental
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
ACLS Dental ALS course that's oral
 
02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
Conscious Sedation that's take take
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
to triazolam in the waiting room right
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about general anesthesia
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
here that oral Maxwell facial surgeons
 
02:18:47.309 --> 02:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
are trained in you know 32e residency I
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
read your papers and um I mean that's
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's a different that's a that's a
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
different type of sedation oral
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%

02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
about two different animals here all
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
right I I don't I don't think I am
 
02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
talking about deep sedation general
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
anesthesia because in the den 3044 it's
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's requiring that the dentist who's
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to have that deep sedation general
 
02:19:23.389 --> 02:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
anesthesia permit has to have ACLS imp
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
Pals and then in Den 3047 that you're
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
referring to it's talking about the
 
02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
dentist the the operator the the surgeon
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
if you will having to also you're you're
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
saying they should also have ACLS and
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
Pals which we could certainly do if
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's what the consensus on the
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
committee is but that's going to be even
 
02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
more of access to care issue because now
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
every dentist in the state's going to
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.309 --> 02:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist no I'm asking you about
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
removing the requirement
 
02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:54.469 align:start position:0%
removing the requirement
for

02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
ACLS to treat to treat any patient under
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia in a dental office I
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
don't think we did that because as I was
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
saying in Den 3044 qualifications for
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
permitting I read it it's still says
 
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
that they have to have ACLS and Pals um
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
but for for these in the Pediatric
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
setting where I think it's actually even
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
more dangerous U that's that's my
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
opinion I guess
 
02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:22.590 align:start position:0%
opinion I guess
um

02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
3047 30407 this is Page uh I'm on page
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
12 I guess
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
actually response this is from Matt
 
02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.469 align:start position:0%
actually response this is from Matt
Smith

02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
30407 a8a has been rewarded to remove
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
the requirement for ACLS certification
 
02:20:41.469 --> 02:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
this is under facility and facility
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
hosting requirements and it's specific
 
02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:20:51.070 --> 02:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
um the Pediatric patient I believe
 
02:20:52.429 --> 02:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
right so so that feedback that was
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
feedback we took into consideration from
 
02:20:56.190 --> 02:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
the Pediatric Dental Community
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
specifically because they predominantly
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
treat young children so they were
 
02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that if we required all of the
 
02:21:05.870 --> 02:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentists to get both ACLS and
 
02:21:08.349 --> 02:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
Pals it was kind of like an unnecessary
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
hurdle because they're not treating
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
adults they're treating children no I
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
know I understand I
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
agree but I maybe it's the age cut off
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to talk about then it's 13
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
eight it's the 8 to 13 Gap I guess so
 
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
what do you what do you do right if if
 
02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have ACLS and you only have
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
Pals and you're treating under 13 so
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the age Gap that we need to
 
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
talk about okay my point is rules are
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
flawed as they're submitted I guess I
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
guess that's that's rather than taking
 
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
up any more time of the committee thank
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you all right further
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee for the
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
doctors and board
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
members so we heard from um in the rules
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
my concern again around the Pediatric
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
Dentistry there's a question of whether
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
you need two providers or only a single
 
02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
provider for for children and as I did
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
my research and trying to understand the
 
02:22:06.990 --> 02:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
the law that was passed and the law that
 
02:22:09.870 --> 02:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
was passed that for patients under 13
 
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
two providers were required is that
 
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
correct correct that was in 2018 HB
 
02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
1577 and so these rules are looking to
 
02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
reflect that and my as a followup to
 
02:22:20.319 --> 02:22:21.230 align:start position:0%
reflect that and my as a followup to
that

02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
um the argument was that in that same
 
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
law they gave the board authority to
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
create exemptions for surgeons correct
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
correct and what the board did was it it
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
created those exemptions for the
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
children under from 9 to 13 and said
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
that you have one set of criteria um
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
which is um you can only have you could
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
have one person who is certified in all
 
02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriate Provisions but if you
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
were under the age of eight you had to
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
have two provider or eight and under you
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
had to have two providers an
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist whose only job is to
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
monitor the child and then the surgeon
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
whose job is to do the actual work is
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
that my understanding what these rules
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
are looking to ad do and adopt yes
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the question came up
 
02:23:05.550 --> 02:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
about emergencies and I had this
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
question too kid goes to the emergency
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
room with a baseball bat to the face
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
they call a surgeon the uh and the kid
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
is transported to the doctor's office
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
for for whatever necessary work is
 
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
needed to done due to this baseball bat
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
to the face
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
and they don't have an anesthesiologist
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
and a kid's eight years
 
02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
old what happens okay so we have three
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions in that situation which we
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
responded to in the feedback um that was
 
02:23:35.950 --> 02:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee um so one
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
option would be to give the child
 
02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation if you felt they
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
needed sedation don't give them the full
 
02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
deep where they're unconscious give them
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
a conscious moderate sedation instead um
 
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
another option would be to bring in a
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
separate anesthesia providers so that
 
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
could be again um certified registered
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
nurse anesthetist it could be a dentist
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist could be a physician um
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
and then your third option would be to
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
take them to the hospital or surgery
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
center and actually when hb1 1577 was
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature in 2018
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
something that I thought was uh very
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
shrewd on behalf of the legislature is
 
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
they actually looked at the statutes
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
that involved insurance
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and they they raised the
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
age for the requirement for anesthesia
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
facility reimbursement for dental
 
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
procedures to 13 whereas it was
 
02:24:28.349 --> 02:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
six so I I feel like the legislature has
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
done everything it can to provide
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
alternatives to the public beyond having
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
a dentist give general anesthesia to the
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
child with just the staff and no
 
02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:40.670 align:start position:0%
child with just the staff and no
anesthesiologist

02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist
 
02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:42.230 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist
there

02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay so one more fell so again trying to
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
understand this and the concerns of
 
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
access of care which I think is like one
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
of the big concerns that was discussed
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
by providing having required two
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
providers that surgeons would have a
 
02:24:59.309 --> 02:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
trouble providing care for students for
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
patients or delay care patients but when
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
I read the 2019 there was a guideline
 
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
put out by both the uh um AAP uh the
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
association of pediatric um providers as
 
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
well as the associate Association for um
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
dental pediatric dental providers it
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
specifically requires for kids under uh
 
02:25:23.070 --> 02:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
it says that two children two should be
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
required for under age8 in their own
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines for pediatric dentists so is
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
that again did you take these kind of
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
rules at looking at the AP and the
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the one is for the pediatric
 
02:25:38.349 --> 02:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
dentists um those model guidelines and
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
use that to develop the uh Provisions
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
that were put forth go yes so um the
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
scientific bodies in dentistry which
 
02:25:49.309 --> 02:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
would include the American Association
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
of Orland Max loation surgeons the
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
American Society of dentists the
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists the American Academy
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
of pediatric dentistry they have done a
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
number of excellent Publications and
 
02:25:59.950 --> 02:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
research on their own part about making
 
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
in office anesthesia for dentists as
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
safe as possible so we looked at theirs
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then we also looked at Medical
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
Publications so what you're referring to
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
is a publication that was a joint
 
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
publication between the American Academy
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics which is a physic
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
organization and the American Academy of
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentistry and where the two
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
collaborated and published that document
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
they were saying there should be a
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
separate provider for deep sedation
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia for young children
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
right specifically say however we're
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
aware of adverse outcomes when single
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
dental provider simultaneously performs
 
02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
the procedure and administers deep set
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
sedation or general anesthesia for
 
02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
dental procedures and then these
 
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines assure the safety of patients
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
to undergo the procedure so your goal
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
was to deal with those adverse effects
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
for younger patients and yet still give
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the surgeons some wiggle room and
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
the older kids for lack of Ben phrase
 
02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang one of the things that we
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
took into account is there's a balance
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
between safety and access to care and we
 
02:27:03.070 --> 02:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
tried to come up with a compromise that
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
would work the best for everyone and it
 
02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
is difficult at times my I'm an
 
02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
endodontist I deal with emergencies
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
there are people this afternoon that
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't know my name that I'll be seeing
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a certain segment of
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
emergencies that have to go to the
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
hospital and there're certain that you
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
can deal with but in our community
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
um I have yet to see and I deal with
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
trauma to the face all the time uh a
 
02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
collaboration of of providers that can't
 
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
give that patient access to
 
02:27:35.469 --> 02:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
care further questions about the Comm
 
02:27:37.469 --> 02:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank thank you
 
02:27:40.349 --> 02:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
gentleman for coming and bringing this
 
02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
expertise um I'm sure you're thankful
 
02:27:44.349 --> 02:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
that you practice in Manchester where
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other providers
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
around you um and I think that one of
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
the things to look at is the um the
 
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines such as from the association
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
of oral maxf facial surgeons who were
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
able to balance the needs both in highly
 
02:28:00.429 --> 02:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
populated areas and those more rural
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
areas with less access to care um and
 
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how you weighted the safety
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
of children up in the north country with
 
02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
their access to care should they not be
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
able to make it down to an area like
 
02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester in order to get these
 
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.349 align:start position:0%
Manchester in order to get these
procedures

02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
done um there's a few comments I can
 
02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
make about that I guess the first is um
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature seemed to make it quite
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
clear in 2018 when they passed House
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 1577 that there should be a
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
separate anesthesia provider uh for ages
 
02:28:33.389 --> 02:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
12 and under now they did Grant the
 
02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
Dental Board the authority to determine
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
a s a policy for exemptions to oral
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
surgeons however the legislature could
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
have said we exempt all oral surgeons
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
but they didn't um the next move of the
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
D board was one year later the Dental
 
02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
Board said well we'll just exempt all
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons and then the Dental Board
 
02:28:59.710 --> 02:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
was audited a couple of years later by
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the Legislative budget assistant and it
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
was determined that no you you can't
 
02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
just you can't just exempt all oral Surs
 
02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
you have to have a a protocol for
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
determining how this can be done safely
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and balancing what Dr lington was
 
02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
saying access to care with patient
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
safety uh the board provided a number of
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
documents to the committee um that
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
highlight how
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
specifically the age under six age group
 
02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
is very at risk of um life-threatening
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
complications from anesthesia that could
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
be um progressing to a deeper level of
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
sedation than was intended uh it could
 
02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
be some sort of an airway uh compromise
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
situation um and in those situations
 
02:29:42.910 --> 02:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's much more challenging to rescue the
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
young child versus an older patient so
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
when you refer to more rural parts of
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
the state um I guess I guess the
 
02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
decision for the committee is and for
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature in general is um do we
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
feel that the risk you know the risk
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
versus um access to care um you know uh
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
scale is it is it tilted more towards
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
risk when you get to a very young
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
patient population um and the um the
 
02:30:17.429 --> 02:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
Dental Board felt that yes for the under
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
for the eight and underage group The
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
requirement for a separate provider for
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
deep sedation general anesthesia the
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
risk outweighed the benefit now like I
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
said they could still do moderate
 
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
sedation in the rural area they could
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
still bring in a separate provider or
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
they could still take them to a hospital
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
setting if they need deep sedation but
 
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
their other option would be
 
02:30:39.309 --> 02:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
moderate can I can I speak for one
 
02:30:42.670 --> 02:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
minute um in the health care professions
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
this is the only segment that allows for
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
one provider to be present for a child
 
02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
doing the procedure and doing the
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
anesthesia only place in healthc care
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
profession if you go for colonoscopy and
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're 50 years old there's going to be
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
an anesthesiologist there there's going
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
to be a doctor there so I really think
 
02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
that um we need to become in line with
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
the general population of medical
 
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
providers follow sorry yes as a followup
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I wasn't quite sure how not
 
02:31:17.630 --> 02:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
how doing a 32- we rotation in
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
anesthesiology wasn't considered an
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
adequate quit qualification for the oral
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
maxi facial surgeons since that's
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
required for board lure that wouldn't
 
02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
feel like a blanket statement but now
 
02:31:29.309 --> 02:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand how you can
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
look at data for Pediatric patients six
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
and under and then apply those rules to
 
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
patients eight and under I appreciate
 
02:31:38.469 --> 02:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
how you're trying to balance patient
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
safety but um to me looking at it
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
looking at how the rules have been
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
implemented um to me it just seems too
 
02:31:47.469 --> 02:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
far from where the legislative intent is
 
02:31:50.110 --> 02:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
with how the rules are being implemented
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
um so I I still continue to have a a
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
significant problem with how they're
 
02:31:56.429 --> 02:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
implemented although I appreciate how
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're trying to balance safety first so
 
02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that effort I just disagree
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
on how it's being done representative
 
02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank thank you Mr chair I wonder
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
if I could ask uh just could you tell us
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
um generally around the country um other
 
02:32:15.389 --> 02:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
states you know what is their rule with
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
regard if if we were to adopt this
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
proposal would we be
 
02:32:22.269 --> 02:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the majority of
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
other states do or would we have more
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions than most States my
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is um New Hampshire would
 
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
be the first state to actually require
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the second provider under a certain age
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
group now there are other states that
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a more restrictive policy for which
 
02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons would qualify to get a
 
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
permit um for instance um I we provided
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the committee um the model um oral
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
American Academy of pediat or I'm sorry
 
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of periodontics
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
American Association of oral surgeons
 
02:32:57.309 --> 02:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
and American Society of dentist
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist proposed rules which
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
some states have adopted and that
 
02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
requires for ages eight and under these
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
are their official national guidelines
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
ages eight and under you can get a
 
02:33:11.309 --> 02:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
permit to provide deep sedation general
 
02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
anesthesia however you have to do at
 
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
least 50 cases every two years to
 
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for the permit so that would be
 
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
a small number of oral surgeons that
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
would qualify but they could still get
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
the permit if they do that volume of
 
02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
patients and can I ask a followup one
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
follow can you tell us uh I i' I've
 
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
heard that and I don't and this is what
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'm really asking about that that the
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
the concern for children under eight
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
stems from a particularly unfortunate
 
02:33:41.389 --> 02:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
incident that happened in California
 
02:33:44.670 --> 02:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
which um apparently you know adopted
 
02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
National notoriety but I I'm wondering
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you could tell us in the state that
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
have a looser requirement than this rule
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
would propose have there you know can
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
you tell us anything about have there
 
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
been a a a consistent history of
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
problems of you know of unfortunate
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
outcomes with with young children uh
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to first of all um the
 
02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
board and I was one that in initiated
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
this there was no reporting of any
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
adverse effect in the dental office
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
unless it was voluntary and now we are
 
02:34:25.230 --> 02:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
requiring you to report if a patient is
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
admitted to the hospital within 48 Hours
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
even if it's not Dental related if if it
 
02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
they were in your office they have to
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
report it to the Dental Board so they
 
02:34:35.309 --> 02:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
can investigate unfortunately the only
 
02:34:37.950 --> 02:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
time you hear about this is when there's
 
02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
litigation last week there was an
 
02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
article about a a mother whose son died
 
02:34:45.950 --> 02:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
in an oral surgeon's office and was very
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
upset because she was a nurse and if
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
she'd have known there was only one
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
provider she wouldn't have allowed it to
 
02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
happen because in the hospital they
 
02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't allow it to happen so that data is
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
very hard to find and it only surfaces
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
when there's a a major lawsuit and it
 
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
gets in the papers so the reality of it
 
02:35:06.190 --> 02:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
is we're not really sure other than the
 
02:35:09.870 --> 02:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
fact that the medical model
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
of Physicians doesn't allow it to me
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's that says enough as far as the
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
standard of care and and the oral
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
surgeons are very well trained there's
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
no question about it most of them have
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
MDS that's not the issue the issue is
 
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
02:35:27.710 --> 02:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
emergency you know use the example of uh
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
Miracle on the Hudson Sy had 20,000
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
hours 20 years of flying experience he
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
needed his co-pilot to help him land
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
that airplane this is what we're talking
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
about it's not the everyday thing it's
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
when there's an emergency having only
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
one person monitoring that patient
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the emergency is not
 
02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable if you can talk to Dr Abel
 
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
about the the the difficulty in starting
 
02:35:54.190 --> 02:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
an IV of of of dealing with uh the
 
02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
airway and all those things so that's
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
really the issue the issue is the
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
emergency not the
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
training further question further
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee we have a couple more people
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
that want to
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
question so I've had uh several oral
 
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
surgeons situations uh but I'm also uh a
 
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
fully grown human being uh of
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
considerable age uh and I know that it's
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh I've I've been operated on by very
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
competent individuals and it was not a
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
pleasant experience nobody would say
 
02:36:44.670 --> 02:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
they the kind of thing we want to do on
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
your vacation um but the thing is that
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to provide
 
02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:53.590 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to provide
for

02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely every situation when there's
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
an emergency uh one of the my colleagues
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
talked about a baseball bat to the face
 
02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
of a child wouldn't be good with an
 
02:37:10.830 --> 02:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
adult either so uh what is the Practical
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
result I I I'm listening I I have some
 
02:37:16.110 --> 02:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
experience with this as I said I'm
 
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
listening and I'm wondering how many and
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and representative Lan talked about
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
somebody up in the North Country they
 
02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
they got to be helicoptered in to get
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
there within any kind of a reasonable
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
time frame and so forth we're not going
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to save EV absolutely
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
everybody under every circumstance
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not feasible so we
 
02:37:42.990 --> 02:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
have to consider practicability and I
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
think Dr lington if I got your name
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
correct sir uh where you want to have
 
02:37:51.389 --> 02:37:51.399 align:start position:0%
that second person and there I get that
 
02:37:54.190 --> 02:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
but if you if you if you basically can't
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
have that then what are the Alternatives
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
so so representative if you're in the
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
North country and you have a heart
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
attack you go to the hospital and you
 
02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
need bypass surgery they'll make it
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
happen we need to maybe adjust our our
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
delivery system but the bottom line is I
 
02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I I won't know the
 
02:38:18.269 --> 02:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
six-year-old that I saved his life but
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
access to care I think is really an
 
02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
issue in this state the North Country
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'm fine I I literally have people drive
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
down to see me not because of my you
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
know office uh Decor or my personality
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
but they just like to come see me but
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
they can they go past probably five or
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
six idon on the way down here so the
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
reality of it is I don't I can't see in
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
this state the access to care in the
 
02:38:44.429 --> 02:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
North Country being an issue when we're
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the safety of
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
children representative Lynn so I wonder
 
02:38:51.150 --> 02:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
if I could just follow if I'm
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly and I think this
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
this this was something that I I didn't
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
understand and it's very helpful to know
 
02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
this but if I understand correctly what
 
02:39:00.269 --> 02:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that take it outside of
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
the dental context for a moment what
 
02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying is in any other context
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
but Dentistry if somebody is going to be
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
put under uh under general anesthesia
 
02:39:13.150 --> 02:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
there needs to be two people present is
 
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
that right so if that's
 
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
true if I'm understanding correctly then
 
02:39:23.790 --> 02:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
the the dental these Dental regulations
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
would already make a an exception to
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
that for children that are over the age
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
of 13 or I'm sorry I'm sorry from 9 to
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
13 and over so so there's
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
already a difference which apparently
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
the dental Society thinks is okay to say
 
02:39:46.910 --> 02:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need to have two people
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
present if if you're doing dental
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
surgery of some kind and the person is 9
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
years or older and so I I guess I mean
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
that really that significantly it seems
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
undermines the idea that you know we're
 
02:40:06.469 --> 02:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
making a big exception here because you
 
02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
already you already are making a big
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
exception in that in that apparently
 
02:40:14.830 --> 02:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
dental procedures are the only ones for
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
at least most people from nine up where
 
02:40:20.349 --> 02:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a second person
 
02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
present and if you know if we're willing
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
to if we think or you think as experts
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
that that it's appropriate to take that
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
risk I guess I wonder why it's not
 
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate to take the risk for people
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
under age nine where
 
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
apparently many other states do
 
02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
that so A few things about that
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
so um the American Association of or Max
 
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
facial surgeons has uh comprehensive
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
training requirements membership
 
02:40:55.150 --> 02:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for oral surgeons in the
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
United States uh requiring that oral
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
surgeons uh have an office anesthesia
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation where their office is
 
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
inspected for handling medical
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
emergencies um as well as do quarterly
 
02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
emergency training drills with their
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
office staff um uh attend an airway
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
emergency course every so often um so
 
02:41:16.910 --> 02:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's a number of continuing education
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
requirements for oral surgeons to make
 
02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
the office administration of dental
 
02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
anesthesia as safe as possible um in
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
Additionally the oral surgeon is working
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the mouth which is the patients
 
02:41:29.710 --> 02:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
Airway where they're breathing which is
 
02:41:33.710 --> 02:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
the most common area of concern uh under
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
sedation that there would be a
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
respiratory emergency the oral surgeon
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
is right there to manage it now when we
 
02:41:42.349 --> 02:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
get to a younger age group we provided
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh Publications to the committee that
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
shows how the risk versus um you you
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
know ease of of of Emergency Management
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
changes as the child gets younger once
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
they get in that specifically the six
 
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
and underage group although um you know
 
02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
like I was saying the American
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
Association of oral Max facial surgeons
 
02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
American Society of dentist
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists and American Academy
 
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
of periodontology pick the age of eight
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
and under is a more risk age group um
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
the children are more susceptible to the
 
02:42:16.269 --> 02:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
anesthesia they're more likely to have a
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
life-threatening Airway event and if you
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
have to rest resue them they'll be
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
harder to put in a breathing Tu they'll
 
02:42:23.950 --> 02:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
be harder to do an emergency cryo
 
02:42:27.389 --> 02:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
thyroidotomy mind of vain mind of veined
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
for all of that so that that was the
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
reason for picking specifically the
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
younger age group to require the second
 
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you gentlemen for
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
being here just on the reporting thing
 
02:42:46.030 --> 02:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
with the you know if if if a child goes
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
to the hospital and reporting to the um
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
Dental Association or whatever
 
02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh does any other state do that I'm
 
02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
sorry does any other state do that as
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
far as the reporting when a child goes
 
02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
under sedation I I can't really uh
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
answer that but the the uh incident that
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
that this gentleman was talking with the
 
02:43:08.030 --> 02:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
Senate over here um that made the papers
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
and everything else but that that was
 
02:43:10.750 --> 02:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that brought light to
 
02:43:12.990 --> 02:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
the Dental Board that we weren't
 
02:43:14.990 --> 02:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
informed there's been a lot
 
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
of anesthesia emergencies that don't
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
resolve in a death but resolve in other
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
things and now they'll have to report
 
02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
all of that so all of the stuff uh
 
02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
having a linges b all these different
 
02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
things that could happen that don't
 
02:43:30.510 --> 02:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
result in a death um we're not just
 
02:43:31.950 --> 02:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a patient dying we're
 
02:43:34.349 --> 02:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
talking about you know what happens when
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
this you know child goes into this this
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
problem and uh so making it uh death
 
02:43:44.590 --> 02:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
being the the final outcome that you
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
have to report no it's any adverse
 
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
effect so I can't answer that question
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you can I
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
clarify um So based on the documents
 
02:43:56.910 --> 02:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
that were submitted by the dental board
 
02:43:59.550 --> 02:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
with the rule um my understanding is
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem across the
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
country without with not reporting these
 
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
types of things so it was it's difficult
 
02:44:07.630 --> 02:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
for them to do some of the studies and
 
02:44:11.070 --> 02:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken the model rules for
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
the national
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
standards were wanting people to add
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
that portion in about the reporting back
 
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
to the Dental Board of the state
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
so it's not something that's done like
 
02:44:24.510 --> 02:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
across the country but they're saying
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
like it needs to be done and we were the
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
one of the first boards to implement
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
that so sen I will tell you I researched
 
02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
last night about this California has
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
already implemented a reporting Rule and
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
so is Arizona boast both due to adverse
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
incidents that occurred and legislation
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
that got brought forward that ended up
 
02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
requiring uh this kind of reporting and
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm agreeing with it 100% you know
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the reporting is there going
 
02:44:48.349 --> 02:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
to be a fiscal impact for the other
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
medical agency at all that that we
 
02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
should be aware of uh to report to you
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
to the board I'm having a hard time
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
hearing you I'm I'm sorry I've got a
 
02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
loud voice well I yeah uh D drills will
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
there be
 
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
a b
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
banned uh is there a will there be a
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact for the other uh medical
 
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh facilities to report that's all
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's well I the only time you have to
 
02:45:18.429 --> 02:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
report is when you have a we're hoping
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
that there's not a lot of
 
02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
reports but that aners your question
 
02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
reports but that aners your question
good

02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
answer so again I'm going to kind of
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
bring the committee back together so the
 
02:45:28.830 --> 02:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
issue is that we could either object or
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
do anything on is around the access of
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
care issue and public good issue of the
 
02:45:36.750 --> 02:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
rule and the new requirement um if I'm
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
not mistaken attorney will correct me I
 
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
think they're within the law um that
 
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
they that the rules they propose are
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
within the changes of the law and are
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
allowed by law is that correct yes my
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
allow analysis is that the rules are
 
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
compliant with the law thank you so it
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
becomes a question on ja car rules
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not the access of care is a
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
big enough issue as when compared to
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
patient safety uh for the rules they've
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
decided I think representative Lynn
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
earmarked it out very cleanly nine and
 
02:46:04.750 --> 02:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
above you can have a single provider in
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
the room providing both the uh surgical
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
event as well as providing anesthesia
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
but at 8 and under um the new rule now
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
requires that there be two anesthesi
 
02:46:17.790 --> 02:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
there be an anesthesiologist as well as
 
02:46:19.710 --> 02:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
the doctor who's going to provide the
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
care in the room for children8 and under
 
02:46:24.510 --> 02:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
due to the heightened risk of children
 
02:46:26.429 --> 02:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
at8 and under and then the last
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
component which I was concerned about
 
02:46:30.190 --> 02:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
was emergencies and the answer to that
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
seemed to be that if there was an
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
emergency and you didn't have access to
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist within your practice
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
you would take them to the local
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
hospital and use the onall
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
anesthesiology anesthesiologist at the
 
02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
local hospital to be able to still
 
02:46:45.309 --> 02:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
provide that care does that summarize it
 
02:46:49.150 --> 02:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
accurately 100% thank you
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
motion do we have testimony on the other
 
02:46:53.389 --> 02:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
side of the issue we do have four more
 
02:46:56.190 --> 02:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
people to testify thank you all right I
 
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
think we're all Jackie I apologize but
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure that what
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
is we want to Institute a rule and then
 
02:47:07.630 --> 02:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to collect the data to make
 
02:47:10.389 --> 02:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
sure that the rule is what we need is
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
that right I'm not exactly so in 2018
 
02:47:16.830 --> 02:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature determined that there
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
should be a separate anesthesia provider
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
ages 12 and under in all dental offices
 
02:47:24.429 --> 02:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
but they gave the agency the Dental
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
Board the power to determine if there
 
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
should be exemptions for oral surgeons
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
so we looked from a safety standpoint
 
02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
and determined what age that there
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
should be the two and what age there
 
02:47:38.670 --> 02:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.389 --> 02:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
exemption fine thank
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you guys next up we'll have um
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:55.630 --> 02:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
M you just state your name and the
 
02:48:01.309 --> 02:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
sir um my name's uh Dr johnan Bean I'm a
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:12.150 align:start position:0%
 
sir

02:48:12.150 --> 02:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
better uh I'm a board certified oral and
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
Max facial surgeon uh operating at a
 
02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.750 align:start position:0%
Max facial surgeon uh operating at a
Manchester

02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:20.830 align:start position:0%
Manchester
and

02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
pimbrook however I have also worked in
 
02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
other regions of the state including the
 
02:48:29.230 --> 02:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
North country in North Conway
 
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
Salem uh and
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
nashwa uh just uh to address some of the
 
02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
things that were just mentioned I would
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh completely argue that North Country
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
does have an access of care issue
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
already and it's a challenge to even
 
02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
staff our offices up there
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
what's more is if you were to have a
 
02:48:52.349 --> 02:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
heart attack in the North Country I
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
doubt that you want a cabbage performed
 
02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
at the memorial hospital down the
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
street um but uh you know I I agree with
 
02:49:05.070 --> 02:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
um Dr ael's assessment that the question
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
has to
 
02:49:11.469 --> 02:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
become uh risk versus access to care uh
 
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
I I think that that is something we we
 
02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
do have to consider when we consider
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
these things um but I share a number of
 
02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
my Donal colleagues concerns with the
 
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
rules that have been set out in D 304 in
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
regards to access to care and the
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
financial burden that is placed on the
 
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
patient uh I currently hold privileges
 
02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
at CMC and Elliot Hospital Systems I
 
02:49:33.710 --> 02:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
previously held uh privileges at St
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
Joe's and Southern I will tell you that
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
as it stands currently
 
02:49:42.349 --> 02:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
today uh there is little to no oral
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
surgery coverage at the hospital in this
 
02:49:48.910 --> 02:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
state um Plymouth is at about 100% I
 
02:49:51.670 --> 02:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
believe and then Dartmouth at 100%
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
Elliott has about 60% of oral surgery
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
coverage for 365 days out of the
 
02:50:01.389 --> 02:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
year uh which means that if there is a
 
02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
child that falls in this age range that
 
02:50:06.269 --> 02:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
gets hit in the face with a bat I I
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that I would use that example
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
right off but uh if they have a dental
 
02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
infection because they haven't been able
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
to get access to care because they
 
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to get into an office
 
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
that has an anesthesia provider and I
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
doubt that that anesthesia provider is
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to be ready to go on a moment's
 
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
notice for that emergency by the way
 
02:50:27.309 --> 02:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
they're a month behind scheduling
 
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
out um then that person that kid has to
 
02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
be transferred to a tertiary Center such
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
as Dartmouth or Boston Hospital assuming
 
02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
that that hospital even has a bed
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
available for them otherwise that kid is
 
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
stuck with minimal Management in an ER
 
02:50:46.990 --> 02:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
until adequate care can be
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
found um I recently was consulted on a
 
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
5-year-old kid uh little girl that had a
 
02:50:57.950 --> 02:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
dental infection associated with a caras
 
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
or cavity um on her tooth uh and uh
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
infection had involved the left side of
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
her face um she was admitted to the
 
02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
Elliott hospital system administered IV
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
antibiotics and I was consulted on the
 
02:51:13.150 --> 02:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
case I eventually took that patient to
 
02:51:15.269 --> 02:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
the operating room for removal of that
 
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
single tooth drainage of her facial
 
02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:19.870 align:start position:0%
single tooth drainage of her facial
infection

02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
infection
 
02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the infection did eventually
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
resolve however that 5-year-old had to
 
02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
sit up in the hospital for 5 days being
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
treated with uh this condition face
 
02:51:33.630 --> 02:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
swellen miserable with her parent in
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
attendance um offer a procedure that
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
could have been managed in outpatient
 
02:51:38.399 --> 02:51:39.790 align:start position:0%
could have been managed in outpatient
under

02:51:39.790 --> 02:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh and currently in insured an
 
02:51:45.630 --> 02:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
uninsured patient that had that
 
02:51:47.710 --> 02:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
experience is likely to be build
 
02:51:50.030 --> 02:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 40 to
 
02:51:53.229 --> 02:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
$50,000 so uh in addition to the
 
02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
terrible experience that she had sitting
 
02:51:57.030 --> 02:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
up there the financial burden that's
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
placed on that patient and her family is
 
02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:00.710 align:start position:0%
placed on that patient and her family is
very

02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
significant this change these changes
 
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
that we are making with d
 
02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
304 they are going to alter our access
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
to care we can debate all day on how
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
much but we are going to push a number
 
02:52:17.309 --> 02:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
of these patients into the hospital
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
system to be treated
 
02:52:21.550 --> 02:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
a hospital system that currently does
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
not have the means to manage it so my
 
02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that if these rules go
 
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
through as they are written and I think
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're poorly written to say the least
 
02:52:37.950 --> 02:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh not just on the basis of what they're
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
doing um if they go through then we're
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to create a significant burden on
 
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
our patients in all of these areas not
 
02:52:49.229 --> 02:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
just the North Country on access to here
 
02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
um I recommend that this committee um
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
move these rules back to the board for
 
02:52:55.150 --> 02:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion and
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
revision thank
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
you questions for the
 
02:53:02.950 --> 02:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
doctor seeing none thank you Doctor oh
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh representative Leon uh
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:53:08.590 --> 02:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
doctor for being here um my question is
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
about um the medical consequences the
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
mortality and morbidity of these
 
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
children that are going untreated
 
02:53:17.469 --> 02:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
because of lack of access to care versus
 
02:53:20.349 --> 02:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
the risk of adverse reaction to the
 
02:53:22.510 --> 02:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
anesthesia right uh even in their own
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
data that they submitted to you was over
 
02:53:26.910 --> 02:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
media references uh had a total I
 
02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
believe of 44 deaths over the course of
 
02:53:31.389 --> 02:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
about a 30-year period from 1980s to
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
like 2011 and yeah roughly deaths in New
 
02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in in the United States sir
 
02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
yeah in the United States uh in of those
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
deaths that are listed there in that
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork I believe um seven uh were
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
from anesthesiologist eight were from
 
02:53:50.990 --> 02:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons the remainder were not
 
02:53:52.469 --> 02:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
really classified very well between
 
02:53:54.990 --> 02:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
Pediatric and general dentistry of which
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
their anesthesia training is very
 
02:54:02.550 --> 02:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
unclear um so if you consider the number
 
02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
of sedations that are done across the
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
country over that time by Oral Surgeons
 
02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
who do in the dental office
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 80 to 85% roughly uh the
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
number of sedations in the
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
US uh in a 30-year period if they are
 
02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
working working 200 days uh out of the
 
02:54:22.990 --> 02:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
Year roughly um and they average three
 
02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
three to four sedations a day um you're
 
02:54:29.229 --> 02:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at uh you know
 
02:54:32.229 --> 02:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
approximately a million sedations a year
 
02:54:36.269 --> 02:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
roughly uh give or take um at 44 deaths
 
02:54:38.710 --> 02:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
over 30 years you're now looking at a
 
02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
mortality rate that's somewhere around 1
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
point two over a million cases um so uh
 
02:54:50.830 --> 02:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
the rate that you would see for dental
 
02:54:53.309 --> 02:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
abscess or infection and the potential
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
for it to progress to something that
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
involves the airway complicates the
 
02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
airway for the anesthesia providers even
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the operating
 
02:55:05.710 --> 02:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
room uh is probably similar you know or
 
02:55:08.590 --> 02:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
higher now if you add into to the fact
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
that you're letting this kid just sit
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
there and progress into one of these
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios um you know understand the
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
definitive treatment there's some provid
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
that may try to say that you know
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
antibiotics would be you know well they
 
02:55:23.710 --> 02:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
can get antibiotics they can get oral
 
02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
antibiotics they can get IV antibiotics
 
02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's true up to a point and there's a
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
certain percentage put on the scenario
 
02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
that are not going to respond to that IB
 
02:55:33.630 --> 02:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
antibotics those are the kids that see
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
me ultimately in the hospital right so
 
02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
these are children that have already had
 
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be treated as an
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
outpatient by their dentist by
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
specialist and they have not had
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
definitive care they don't have
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
something called Source control as a
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon uh any surgeon would tell you
 
02:55:55.229 --> 02:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
general surgery uh trauma uh Orthopedics
 
02:55:57.469 --> 02:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
that if you have any kind of
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
infection uh the The Source control is
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
the most important part so that you have
 
02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to in our case take out a
 
02:56:06.670 --> 02:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
tooth bad tooth on a kid in order to
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
have control over that infection if you
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
cannot do that you are not adequately
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
treating that infection always has a
 
02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
chance to progress that bacteria has a
 
02:56:18.590 --> 02:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
chance to become more virent um so yes
 
02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
it it creates a bigger and bigger
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
problem the longer you wait and the
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
increase in access to cure so to answer
 
02:56:26.830 --> 02:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:28.190 align:start position:0%
your question
[Music]

02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you Mr chairman I've just
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
got a question for you about this this
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
44 number over 30 years and the data
 
02:56:36.590 --> 02:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
reporting we we' had a little discussion
 
02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
about sure whether we should report more
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and how whether that's even accurate
 
02:56:43.950 --> 02:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
and and well and how well how good we
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
were generally across the country at
 
02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
collecting data on adverse events and
 
02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and if there was an adverse event in a
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
dental office that was
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
subsequently transp recognized and
 
02:56:58.590 --> 02:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
transported to the ER and then resulted
 
02:57:00.469 --> 02:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
as a death would that be included in
 
02:57:03.229 --> 02:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
that number especially 5 10 20 30 years
 
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
ago and then if you like you did
 
02:57:09.469 --> 02:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
extrapolate 44 years or 44 deaths on an
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis to come up with some other
 
02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
number right how valid is is that data
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
at all especially going back 25 30 years
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry yeah that's uh very uh fair
 
02:57:21.910 --> 02:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
question that data is probably not
 
02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
perfect uh no doubt um as far as it
 
02:57:27.309 --> 02:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
being 44 deaths over that
 
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
time um which is part of the argument
 
02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
they actually make in that article um
 
02:57:38.269 --> 02:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
however uh what I would you know say and
 
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh against that is that if you look at
 
02:57:42.750 --> 02:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
our state there's probably there's
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 of us that are
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
registered within um new New Hampshire
 
02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:48.830 align:start position:0%
registered within um new New Hampshire
uh

02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
Society of oral MX Facial Surgery uh 30
 
02:57:54.229 --> 02:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
of us are probably full-time within the
 
02:57:56.590 --> 02:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
state itself and don't go
 
02:57:59.429 --> 02:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
outside uh that's about the size of a
 
02:58:01.750 --> 02:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
small class or decent classroom in the
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I can guarantee
 
02:58:05.710 --> 02:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
you if one of us had a death in this
 
02:58:07.870 --> 02:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
state every single one of us would at
 
02:58:11.389 --> 02:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
least know about it um that being said
 
02:58:13.070 --> 02:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
like how it's reported how you access
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
that from other states not perfect and I
 
02:58:18.269 --> 02:58:18.279 align:start position:0%
actually agree with Dr lington that that
 
02:58:20.349 --> 02:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
should be like the reporting is very
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
important and I think that that is
 
02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
something that should be included
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
personally but uh I I don't disagree
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
with the reporting aspect of it that's
 
02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:29.349 align:start position:0%
with the reporting aspect of it that's
very

02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:58:32.229 --> 02:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
important uh Senator inis thank you
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
doctor for being here appreciate it um
 
02:58:36.389 --> 02:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
just a couple quick questions you
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
administer anesthesia in your work is
 
02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
that correct yes okay and you charge the
 
02:58:43.870 --> 02:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
patients or the insurance companies for
 
02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
that right uh not the same as an
 
02:58:50.429 --> 02:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
anesthesia provider typically no okay in
 
02:58:54.269 --> 02:58:54.279 align:start position:0%
what way is it different uh less time so
 
02:58:56.349 --> 02:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh for example if you come in to my
 
02:58:58.429 --> 02:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
office for
 
02:58:58.439 --> 02:59:00.030 align:start position:0%
office for
a

02:59:00.030 --> 02:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:59:03.590 --> 02:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh I ran ball poll when I was 12 so
 
02:59:06.429 --> 02:59:06.439 align:start position:0%
let's say I show up I metal across the
 
02:59:08.590 --> 02:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
if you have this is this may be a little
 
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
more personal preference on how I
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
practice but uh no generally as a whole
 
02:59:16.389 --> 02:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
we tend to build less of our time uh
 
02:59:17.790 --> 02:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
than the anesthesia providers within the
 
02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:18.710 align:start position:0%
than the anesthesia providers within the
state

02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:59:21.309 --> 02:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
um you know if you come in and you have
 
02:59:26.269 --> 02:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
a procedure that uh is you know 2 hours
 
02:59:27.950 --> 02:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
long let's say it's extensive whatever
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
it is you're haven't done it was
 
02:59:33.550 --> 02:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh so uh I'm not going to bill for that
 
02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
whole time on anesthesia yeah I have a
 
02:59:37.870 --> 02:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
cut off and that just has to do with the
 
02:59:39.750 --> 02:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
total financial burden I'm putting on
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
somebody okay um that's a conscious
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
decision and uh most of my partners act
 
02:59:46.990 --> 02:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
in that same way in other states I
 
02:59:49.229 --> 02:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
practice in I've actually charged even
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
less uh so to think in a state that
 
02:59:54.750 --> 02:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
you're already charging you're probably
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
one of the more you know New Hampshire
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
as a whole is one of the more expensive
 
03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
States uh to get dental care as a whole
 
03:00:03.990 --> 03:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
you're now going to increase that cost
 
03:00:06.269 --> 03:00:06.279 align:start position:0%
significantly just as an outpatient not
 
03:00:08.070 --> 03:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
to mention the inpatient risk and
 
03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
increase you're going to see uh I I
 
03:00:11.080 --> 03:00:11.910 align:start position:0%
increase you're going to see uh I I
think

03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:00:14.150 --> 03:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's it's tough because you're you're
 
03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
looking at it you're trying to be safe
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
for these pediatric cases I understand
 
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
but you're going to incur an increased
 
03:00:24.229 --> 03:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
cost uh what's more is as I as I
 
03:00:25.550 --> 03:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
understand it these anesthesia providers
 
03:00:29.150 --> 03:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the state that uh kind of uh provide
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
services in these offices most of them
 
03:00:33.710 --> 03:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
have minimums on how much that they bill
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
for so if you are a six-year-old kid
 
03:00:38.670 --> 03:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
coming to outside office and you have
 
03:00:40.349 --> 03:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
one tooth that needs to come out and it
 
03:00:42.190 --> 03:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
takes all of five minutes for me to do
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
that procedure that anesthesia provider
 
03:00:46.510 --> 03:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
says no I'm going to build for the full
 
03:00:50.590 --> 03:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
hour so it has to be that that that case
 
03:00:52.750 --> 03:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
that that person can sit and monitor
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
that patient for at least an hour to
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
make it worth their while to show up in
 
03:00:58.349 --> 03:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
your office that's how it is right now
 
03:01:01.030 --> 03:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you um so you you mentioned you
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
would use general anesthesia for an
 
03:01:05.910 --> 03:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
extraction is that yeah every day really
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
mhm okay yeah I'm not treating the
 
03:01:10.269 --> 03:01:10.279 align:start position:0%
surgery I'm treating your
 
03:01:12.870 --> 03:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
anxiety right that's what the anesthesia
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
is for but the surgery I can do I have
 
03:01:16.429 --> 03:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
patients that do that a weake and I have
 
03:01:18.349 --> 03:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
patients that are like don't touch me
 
03:01:21.229 --> 03:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know well yeah all right thank
 
03:01:23.950 --> 03:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
you so doc I just have two questions yes
 
03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
sir so my two questions are
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
um do you think do you believe that the
 
03:01:34.030 --> 03:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
A and the other one the
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
aapd um guideline that says that
 
03:01:38.830 --> 03:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
children under eight are at more
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
susceptible risk for deepen for adverse
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
injury due to deep or general anesthetic
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that as you just said
 
03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
statement yes I agree with that
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
statement I would say that there is this
 
03:01:58.229 --> 03:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
underlying notion uh that by providing
 
03:02:00.630 --> 03:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
the second provider even having an
 
03:02:03.309 --> 03:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
anesthesiology uh dedicated provider
 
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
there that you're removing the
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
risk you're not removing the risk the
 
03:02:11.309 --> 03:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
risk is never zero soon as you push that
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
first medication that risk is not zero
 
03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
so what they're suggesting is hopefully
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
a means to reduce that risk but if
 
03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
you'll note in every single one of those
 
03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines that were submitted that I I
 
03:02:25.630 --> 03:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
mean I kind of glanced at I couldn't
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
find any data that they're referencing
 
03:02:30.790 --> 03:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
to make those guidelines and I'm not
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
aware of too many uh medical
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
organizations uh our own included that
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
would write a white paper a guideline
 
03:02:42.190 --> 03:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
that did not have extensive data to
 
03:02:43.950 --> 03:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
support those
 
03:02:47.309 --> 03:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh and I and so I have a hard
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
time when I I look at that understanding
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
where that's coming from other than hey
 
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
Two Is Better Than One you know and that
 
03:02:59.590 --> 03:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the thought process but I
 
03:03:01.750 --> 03:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't see any data there that supports
 
03:03:03.630 --> 03:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
their argument of
 
03:03:06.990 --> 03:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
that um that's not to say they're
 
03:03:09.910 --> 03:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
wrong but I don't I don't know where
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's coming from underst but but you
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
agree with the general principle
 
03:03:16.110 --> 03:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
children they more compated more
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
complicated yeah anesthetically other
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
than a risk the second thing is we heard
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
from I think it was Dr lington that made
 
03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
the statement that in health General
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
Healthcare um absent the dental setting
 
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
that when general anesthesia deep
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
anesthesia provided there's always two
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
room what say that again so I think the
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
statement that Doc lington and I'm
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing was that um in medical care
 
03:03:45.790 --> 03:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
in general not absent Dentistry that
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
whenever general anesthesia or deep
 
03:03:50.190 --> 03:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
anesthesia is provided there's an
 
03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist in the room as a that's
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
not always true no so what would so like
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
er for example ER Physicians routinely
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
give uh sedatives that don't necessarily
 
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
involve another provider what but
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
question that General aesthetic whether
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
under or yeah they use ketamine
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry that's me that's probably my
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
fault I'm new to this so again I I I I
 
03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
want to separate moderate low set s
 
03:04:20.950 --> 03:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
from General anesthe and deep an
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
anesthesia where we're putting patients
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
out um and and my understanding and the
 
03:04:28.030 --> 03:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
doctor staven was that in in the general
 
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
in general medicine that's not
 
03:04:32.510 --> 03:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate that there's two people an
 
03:04:35.630 --> 03:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist and and a provider or
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else in the room that when
 
03:04:40.110 --> 03:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
anesthesia like that is given and and
 
03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
and being used no I I I would say that
 
03:04:45.790 --> 03:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh they use General anesthetics in the
 
03:04:48.670 --> 03:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
ER that don't often involve a second
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
provider and that's uh intomy ketamine
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
propofol uh so I no I don't think that's
 
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
completely true you're also comparing
 
03:04:58.190 --> 03:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges is not the same thing
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about medical providers
 
03:05:03.910 --> 03:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
that uh may have a month on anesthesia
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
rotation so you mentioned the 32 weeks
 
03:05:07.630 --> 03:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
you know so you're talking about four
 
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
and a half weeks of training in
 
03:05:13.229 --> 03:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
anesthesia like we're like there's
 
03:05:15.389 --> 03:05:15.399 align:start position:0%
anesthesiology residents that do like
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
full three or four years there's uh you
 
03:05:20.349 --> 03:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
know cras and then there's us and beyond
 
03:05:24.070 --> 03:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
that it's you know you get one month so
 
03:05:25.950 --> 03:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
yeah no there's no other medical
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
profession that has that training where
 
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're running your own operating room
 
03:05:32.229 --> 03:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
you're intubating people every day you
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
know like that's there's no one else
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.510 --> 03:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
you see we still have four more people
 
03:05:44.229 --> 03:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
anfy including a couple doctors it looks
 
03:05:44.239 --> 03:05:45.269 align:start position:0%
anfy including a couple doctors it looks
like

03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:05:48.750 --> 03:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you sir cool thank
 
03:05:53.950 --> 03:05:53.960 align:start position:0%

respectfully urge jail car to Halt

further action on Den 304 the proposed
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
rule conflicts with legislative intent
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%

has a subst Cal economic impact that has
 
03:06:52.590 --> 03:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
not been fully considered omss are

anesthesia to our patients we love what
 
03:07:09.510 --> 03:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
we do and the patients that we serve
 
03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
here's a real world example from my
 
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
practice that actually illustrates one
 
03:07:14.469 --> 03:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
of the case scenarios that was brought
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
up um and the harm that Den three 4
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
could cause to Patient Care and families
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
I received a call on a busy Friday
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
morning this summer from a parent on
 
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
vacation at the lake their young child
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
was involved in a boning accident
 
03:07:30.349 --> 03:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
resulting in a fractured upper jaw with
 
03:07:32.670 --> 03:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
broken and displaced teeth she was
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
unable to move her mouth or speak as her
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
teeth were lodged within her upper lip
 
03:07:39.150 --> 03:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
the patient drove from the Lakes Region
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
to my office in nasua this is an
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
emergent situation as her teeth needed
 
03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be removed from her lip and
 
03:07:46.910 --> 03:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
repositioned with a surgical splint to
 
03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
save her permanent teeth fix the
 
03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
fracture and avoid
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
extractions as you can imagine this is a
 
03:07:55.870 --> 03:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
case that required sedation to S safely
 
03:07:58.349 --> 03:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
treat the child the surgery was able to
 
03:08:01.150 --> 03:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
be completed within hours in a safe
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable cost-effective manner for
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
the patient and her family under the
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
dental board's language for Den
 
03:08:10.269 --> 03:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
304 this time-sensitive treatment would
 
03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
not be possible and most Ms offices in
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
the state we would not be able to
 
03:08:17.150 --> 03:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
administer deep sedation without a
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
separate anesthesia provider or even
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation with the normal
 
03:08:23.469 --> 03:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
medications that we typically use for
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
these cases and we were also trained to
 
03:08:28.389 --> 03:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
do what about you may ask what about
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
sending this patient to the emergency
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
room I have spoken with the director of
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
the emergency room at my local hospital
 
03:08:36.510 --> 03:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
St Joseph's the ER is overburdened and
 
03:08:38.910 --> 03:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
does not have a OMS or dentist on call
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
at all times as Dr Bean already outlined
 
03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
the patient would need to be transferred
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
to another hospital such as Dartmouth or
 
03:08:46.590 --> 03:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
children's where I've spoken with them
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
and they are similarly at capacity this
 
03:08:50.830 --> 03:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
is not even consider the very high
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
Hospital ER visit costs that may be
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
incurred if a patient does need to be
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
taken to the operating room dental
 
03:08:59.950 --> 03:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
insurance does not typically cover
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
facility charges where it can cost
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
patients 10 to 15,000 out of pocket for
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
an O case this could be as simple as
 
03:09:10.070 --> 03:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
extracting a single tooth and does not
 
03:09:12.229 --> 03:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
even include the cost of the surgery
 
03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
itself I do not feel Den 304 is
 
03:09:16.870 --> 03:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
adequately recognized this additional
 
03:09:19.229 --> 03:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
cost on both the system overall but
 
03:09:19.239 --> 03:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
cost on both the system overall but
individual

03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:09:23.110 --> 03:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
families itinerant anesthesia providers
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
are not typically available on a same
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
day on call basis and are often booked
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
out for months they can also come with
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
additional fees where patients can be
 
03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
required to pay in full prior to
 
03:09:36.990 --> 03:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
procedures up to $1,000 per hour I would
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
encourage jail car to make decisions
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
based on clinical data from the state I
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
understand there's been a discussion
 
03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
about data and collection and certainly
 
03:09:46.349 --> 03:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
that's something that we all are
 
03:09:48.429 --> 03:09:48.439 align:start position:0%
interested in obtaining so that we can
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
do the safest thing for our patients and
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
for our communities however have I want
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
to ask the question have there been
 
03:09:57.550 --> 03:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
documented adverse outcomes it's a very
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
small community as Dr Bean outlined I
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
feel like we would all be very aware in
 
03:10:03.389 --> 03:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
a timely manner if there was a large
 
03:10:05.710 --> 03:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
adverse outcome there's no other state
 
03:10:07.469 --> 03:10:07.479 align:start position:0%
in the country that has implemented
 
03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
these policies even in states such as
 
03:10:12.030 --> 03:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
California North Carolina and Texas
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
where there have been adverse outcomes
 
03:10:15.950 --> 03:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
and they've performed studies and they
 
03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
decided to not do that because there's a
 
03:10:20.349 --> 03:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
lack of data to support such a sweeping
 
03:10:22.750 --> 03:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
policy change I cannot imagine it was
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
the legislator's intent to exclude an
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
entire subsection of our population
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
without any
 
03:10:30.750 --> 03:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
justification no set of rules is perfect
 
03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
but this is far from it and does not
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate our specialty or other
 
03:10:38.190 --> 03:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
Dental Specialties um input we
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to Halt further
 
03:10:42.190 --> 03:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
action on Den 304 and direct the board
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
to redraft the rule in alignment with
 
03:10:46.269 --> 03:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
public interest legislative intent and
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized ERS thank you very
 
03:10:59.240 --> 03:10:59.250 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.250 --> 03:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
good morning sorry this I don't normally
 
03:11:23.389 --> 03:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
do this so lots of emotions around this
 
03:11:27.630 --> 03:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
issue um I am another uh practicing uh
 
03:11:29.830 --> 03:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
board certified oral and maxel facial
 
03:11:34.269 --> 03:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
surgeon in the State uh Amy field um I
 
03:11:36.750 --> 03:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
work right here in ASA um I've been
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
licensed to give sedation in the state
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
for over 25 years um as a female I'm
 
03:11:44.510 --> 03:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
sought out by a lot of parents and
 
03:11:46.269 --> 03:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
fellow dentists to treat pediatric
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
patients as a mother of two one of which
 
03:11:52.990 --> 03:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
fairly similar to these other stories in
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
a Boy Scout camp breaks his jaw so we
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
had to manage him and me being the mom
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't manage him myself had to find a
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
surgeon had to find a hospital had to
 
03:12:04.990 --> 03:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
end up bringing him down to uh
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to treat him because there
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
was no facilities in the state that we
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
could manage him he needed uh general
 
03:12:14.830 --> 03:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
anesthesia um so I'm well aware of the
 
03:12:16.670 --> 03:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
need for Sedation in our offices and in
 
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
our local
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals um I have significant concerns
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the den 34 is not in the public
 
03:12:25.750 --> 03:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
interest and we'll have significant
 
03:12:28.269 --> 03:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
access to care issues for the kids of
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh the changes in the
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
rules for anesthesia in office will also
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
create significant difficulties for our
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
parents seeking care for their children
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
not everybody has a car not everybody
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
has uh you know two parents a lot of
 
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
these kids that are on Medicaid have
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
single parents they have to stop their
 
03:12:49.150 --> 03:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
job they have to get in a car if they
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
have one and get these kids to
 
03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:52.269 align:start position:0%
have one and get these kids to
appropriate

03:12:52.269 --> 03:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:12:52.279 --> 03:12:54.910 align:start position:0%
appropriate
facilities

03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:12:59.190 --> 03:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
um they children are a unique subset of
 
03:13:01.750 --> 03:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
our population as you you all know um
 
03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
and they are both physically and
 
03:13:05.870 --> 03:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
psychologically fragile they're all
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
they're also of a different subset you
 
03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
know we talked about that 0 to8 age um
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
needing us needing Pals training to
 
03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
treat them they are physiologically
 
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
different so we as um um oral surgeons
 
03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
are well aware of the difficulties the
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
risk and the um ability to treat these
 
03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
in an office
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
setting um pediatric dentists and um
 
03:13:33.670 --> 03:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons we all highly trained to
 
03:13:36.750 --> 03:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
manage them um and we effectively treat
 
03:13:40.349 --> 03:13:40.359 align:start position:0%
them on a weekly basis um in my practice
 
03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
I only have one day a week with two
 
03:13:44.030 --> 03:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
providers in the office with the rule
 
03:13:46.110 --> 03:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
changes I can't provide sedation for a
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
kid under eight and would need to limit
 
03:13:50.269 --> 03:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
to one day a week for those over a to
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
sedate them forcing me to either send
 
03:13:54.510 --> 03:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
them elsewhere or rely on the good
 
03:13:57.630 --> 03:13:57.640 align:start position:0%
graces of my Lo local hospital um it
 
03:13:59.830 --> 03:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
usually takes one to two months to
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
schedule a hospital case unless it's an
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
emergency um I don't feel that Den 34 is
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
adequately taking this information into
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
consideration for the welfare of the
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
public especially the the kids um we we
 
03:14:17.150 --> 03:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
heard about dental infections um they
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
are in children rapid fast and
 
03:14:25.710 --> 03:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
life-threatening so allowing these kids
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
to be identified in our office and
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
treated in a timely manner is
 
03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:31.190 align:start position:0%
treated in a timely manner is
critical

03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
critical
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
um the only hospitals in New Hampshire
 
03:14:37.630 --> 03:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
that I know of um that can safely manage
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
emergency pediatric patients are
 
03:14:42.670 --> 03:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and one other at the Sea Coast
 
03:14:44.429 --> 03:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
my local hospital of St Joe's is not one
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
of them they don't even have a
 
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics Department so when I have to
 
03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
bring a kid in I have to rely on the
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
ability to have either an outside
 
03:14:55.870 --> 03:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
pediatric um pediatrician come in or
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that they go home same day
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
um there's one other point that I wanted
 
03:15:05.950 --> 03:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify um if that would be helpful
 
03:15:09.550 --> 03:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
um just because it says one provider
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean there's one person in the
 
03:15:14.349 --> 03:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
room we have three dedicated staff with
 
03:15:16.590 --> 03:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
each of our pediatric patients one
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
monitor in one assisting and then the
 
03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
doctor that's actually performing the
 
03:15:24.110 --> 03:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
procedure so we're not working in a
 
03:15:27.429 --> 03:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
vacuum um and our uh staff will not be
 
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to work on those cases until
 
03:15:31.309 --> 03:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
they've had specific training it's
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
called Dance Training so that they are
 
03:15:36.510 --> 03:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
well aware and uh equipped to handle any
 
03:15:38.269 --> 03:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
of those um emergencies that might
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
happen in the chair um I'm one of the
 
03:15:44.830 --> 03:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
few Medicaid providers in the state so I
 
03:15:48.830 --> 03:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
see a lot of kids m well over 50 uh a
 
03:15:51.870 --> 03:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
year in this age you know under six to
 
03:15:54.070 --> 03:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
13 group
 
03:15:58.710 --> 03:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
um if these rules go into effect
 
03:16:00.670 --> 03:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
basically I have no idea where I'm going
 
03:16:02.790 --> 03:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
to send these kids I can't send them all
 
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
up to Manchester I can't send them all
 
03:16:07.630 --> 03:16:07.640 align:start position:0%
up to Dartmouth maybe I can send them
 
03:16:09.429 --> 03:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
across state lines but that is going to
 
03:16:14.429 --> 03:16:14.439 align:start position:0%
be extremely expensive and um extremely
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
um difficult for the parents of the
 
03:16:19.710 --> 03:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
these kids to to make that happen so
 
03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me out appreciate
 
03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:23.189 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me out appreciate
your

03:16:23.189 --> 03:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you very much for
 
03:16:52.750 --> 03:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
your time this morning my n name is Dr
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
Sarah finny I am the New Hampshire
 
03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dental
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
director um I I want to start out by
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
saying that I fully recognize that this
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh rule change has had to weigh access
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
versus risk which is not an easy balance
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
to strike and so I appreciate all the
 
03:17:14.510 --> 03:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
time and energy that has gone into
 
03:17:17.070 --> 03:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
getting us to this point
 
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
um I also want to comment on you know
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
prior speakers we need to do better
 
03:17:24.710 --> 03:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
reporting without a doubt um that's not
 
03:17:27.389 --> 03:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire issue that's Nationwide
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
so I would love to see uh better
 
03:17:35.309 --> 03:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
reporting come out of this whole um
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
process while uh my comments are going
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
to be limited towards Medicaid I am
 
03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
speaking for the division of Medicaid
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
services today um these rule changes I
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
know know were had the best of
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
intentions to provide more safety for um
 
03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
our youngest kids being treated but I
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
think that unfortunately as we have
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
heard there could be unintended
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
consequences that are very
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
negative um I think that without going
 
03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
over the same information again and
 
03:18:09.189 --> 03:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
again I absolutely agree with what Dr
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
field just said um we have an access
 
03:18:16.030 --> 03:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
issue across this state there is limited
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
o time for dental cases to be brought
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
there um and that makes those cases be
 
03:18:26.830 --> 03:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
pushed out months not days or weeks um
 
03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that unfortunately this rule
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
would make that situation
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
worse as has already been said children
 
03:18:37.229 --> 03:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
who already have a dental infection need
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
to get that focus of in in infection
 
03:18:44.349 --> 03:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
taken out as soon as possible otherwise
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
um you risk um much wor infection if not
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
other uh medical
 
03:18:54.150 --> 03:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
consequences in state fiscal year 2024
 
03:18:58.030 --> 03:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
which is July 1st of 2023 to June 30th
 
03:19:02.790 --> 03:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
of 2024 there were 187 cases of children
 
03:19:05.309 --> 03:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
under the age of nine that were Sedated
 
03:19:06.750 --> 03:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
by oral
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
surgeons in New Hampshire this is you
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
know Medicaid
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
data um I have serious concerns if 187
 
03:19:19.150 --> 03:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
children had to be reappointed in a
 
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
different location or with waiting for
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
um a secondary anesthesia provider to be
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
available um those children are going to
 
03:19:30.950 --> 03:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
end up either back at the general
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
dentist's office if not the emergency
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
room requiring much more um treatment
 
03:19:39.389 --> 03:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
and feeling much
 
03:19:45.550 --> 03:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
worse um so I I just ask you to um keep
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
in mind that
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
we are all concerned about weighing risk
 
03:19:54.189 --> 03:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
versus safety and that's not to be taken
 
03:19:58.229 --> 03:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
lightly but this bill as it is uh the
 
03:20:01.189 --> 03:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
rule as it is written currently I think
 
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
pushes us more towards risk and we need
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
to consider this for and and work on
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
this rule to fine-tune it
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
again I'm happy to answer
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions so do real quick before going
 
03:20:16.990 --> 03:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get the represent
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
question did so your opinion is that
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
this this weighs too heavily on the risk
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
side and and doesn't give enough thought
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
to access right thank
 
03:20:29.790 --> 03:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
you I had the same question for all the
 
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
other doctors but I held on to it
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
because I was looking for somebody with
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
your particular purview namely how how
 
03:20:41.469 --> 03:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
many of these cases that we're talking
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
about are either infection or baseball
 
03:20:49.150 --> 03:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
bat to the face so so to speak I am
 
03:20:51.070 --> 03:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
going to be honest with you I do not
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
have that breakdown in my data you have
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
any IDE I would say the vast majority
 
03:21:01.229 --> 03:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
are infection we have very in Medicaid I
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
have relatively low numbers of jaw
 
03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
fractures come through on a yearly basis
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm getting nding from your colleagues
 
03:21:08.760 --> 03:21:10.630 align:start position:0%
I'm getting nding from your colleagues
thank

03:21:10.630 --> 03:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent uh thank
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um does your data on
 
03:21:19.189 --> 03:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
that 187 children show what type of
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
providers they were seeing were they
 
03:21:23.710 --> 03:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
largely Oro oral and aop facial surgeons
 
03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
or all oral
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
surgeons thank you and so there's none
 
03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the sedation happening with other
 
03:21:32.550 --> 03:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
providers for children for dental care
 
03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
there are um I was tasked with looking
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
at what was happening in oral surgery
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
offices um I can certainly go back and
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
provide information because there is
 
03:21:46.990 --> 03:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
anesthesia being provided at Pediatric D
 
03:21:51.389 --> 03:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
offices as well um and then I also had
 
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
numbers for the amount of moderate
 
03:21:56.429 --> 03:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
sedation that was done by pediatric
 
03:21:59.790 --> 03:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
dentists for that same fiscal year that
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
information I think would be helpful but
 
03:22:04.150 --> 03:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest part was those were all all
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
Doc all providers who were trained in
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
this who who treated those 187 children
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be able to with these
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
rules correct correct thank you thank
 
03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
you any further questions see thank you
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
doctor did you just one yeah of the
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
again with the reporting of the 187
 
03:22:26.229 --> 03:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
children were there any adverse effects
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%

can follow up Dr sarapin did give me
 
03:23:52.309 --> 03:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
information regarding moderate sedation
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
and moderate sedation
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
providers in the past three years
 
03:23:57.840 --> 03:23:59.590 align:start position:0%
providers in the past three years
actually

03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
um but in the most recent year pediatric
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
dentists have provided moderate station
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
for over 69 patients oral
 
03:24:12.790 --> 03:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
surgeons have provided moderate station
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
for eight patients so a total of 77
 
03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:19.520 align:start position:0%

2022 pediatric dentists performed over

03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
many more than that um to follow up I am

03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
unequivocally oppose the New Hampshire

Board of dental
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
examiners D de 304 proposed guidelines
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
specifically as it relates to Pediatric
 
03:25:08.110 --> 03:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
minimal and moderate
 
03:25:10.510 --> 03:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
sedation I currently possess an
 
03:25:13.389 --> 03:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
unrestricted moderate sedation permit
 
03:25:15.710 --> 03:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
and for the last 17 years I've been
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
performing moderate station to patients
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
over the age of two and over my training
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
at the University of Florida College of
 
03:25:26.189 --> 03:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
Dentistry was in the use of oral and
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
nasal intranasal moderate
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
station I have safely performed over a
 
03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
thousand moderate stations here in the
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire since
 
03:25:40.590 --> 03:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
2017 and over the course of my career I
 
03:25:42.670 --> 03:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
have successfully performed with no
 
03:25:45.630 --> 03:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions over 3,000 moderate
 
03:25:49.469 --> 03:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
sedation cases suffice it to say I have
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
extensive experience in the use of
 
03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation in the pediatric
 
03:25:54.510 --> 03:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
dental office
 
03:25:58.590 --> 03:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
setting I want to clarify that moderate
 
03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
sedation which is much different than
 
03:26:04.750 --> 03:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
deep sedation is is defined by the Ada
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
the American dentals Association as a
 
03:26:09.910 --> 03:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
drug induced depression of Consciousness
 
03:26:11.830 --> 03:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
during which patients respond
 
03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
purposefully to verbal
 
03:26:16.510 --> 03:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
commands Okay so what this means is that
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
patients are awake for these procedures
 
03:26:21.790 --> 03:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
and they have bilateral communication
 
03:26:24.550 --> 03:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
with the doctor this is clearly very
 
03:26:27.150 --> 03:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
different from being put to sleep for
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
deep sedation or IV sedation in general
 
03:26:33.309 --> 03:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
anesthesia with these proposed
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines as are presented in front of
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
you today the board is inexplicably
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
attempting to eliminate the ability of a
 
03:26:44.349 --> 03:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentist to administer oral
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation to any patient
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
patients under the age of
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
n this is at complete variance with the
 
03:26:55.469 --> 03:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics and the
 
03:26:57.790 --> 03:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
American Academy of pediatric dentistry
 
03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
joint clinical guidelines which have
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
already been referred to regarding deep
 
03:27:06.429 --> 03:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
sedation these guidelines do adhere to
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
the highest safety regimen and
 
03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
nationally established best
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
practices let me be very clear no other
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
state is proposing to restrict pediatric
 
03:27:22.510 --> 03:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
dentists in This Way New Hampshire would
 
03:27:25.349 --> 03:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
be the only state in the country to
 
03:27:26.910 --> 03:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit pediatric dentists from
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
utilizing moderate sedation to patients
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
of any
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
age to date I have not received any data
 
03:27:36.630 --> 03:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
or any explanation that would support
 
03:27:38.229 --> 03:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
making these drastic
 
03:27:40.429 --> 03:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
changes what the board has done with
 
03:27:42.990 --> 03:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
these proposed guidelines is combine
 
03:27:46.830 --> 03:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
permitting guidelines for moderate St
 
03:27:49.269 --> 03:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
together with deep sedation in general
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
CIA dentists who strictly perform
 
03:27:54.550 --> 03:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation such as myself would
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
be required to apply and re receive a
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
permit for deep sedation this is not
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
possible however because we are not
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
trained in deep
 
03:28:06.830 --> 03:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
sedation therefore the only practitioner
 
03:28:09.269 --> 03:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
who could perform sedation on a patient
 
03:28:12.429 --> 03:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
under age n be it moderate sedation or
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
deep sedation would be an oral
 
03:28:17.309 --> 03:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
surgeon oral surgeons mainly focus on
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
extractions for this age group when
 
03:28:21.070 --> 03:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
patients are beginning um and
 
03:28:24.150 --> 03:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing pain or swelling and
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
significant infection and oftentimes as
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
you have heard will require a hospital
 
03:28:31.070 --> 03:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
setting on the other hand pediatric
 
03:28:33.469 --> 03:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
dentists can treat a healthy child in
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
the office with moderate sedation to
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
resolve the dental issues before things
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
get out of hand before major swelling
 
03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
occurs as you've heard from Dr bean and
 
03:28:46.830 --> 03:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
he had to treat them in the hospital
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
so the child as you can imagine would
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
benefit from this
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
significantly the patients Dental issues
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
are resolved and they don't need to go
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
undergo a deeper and more expensive form
 
03:29:01.830 --> 03:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
of sedation which comes with additional
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
risks we all have a role to play here in

New Hampshire taking care of New

Hampshire's children and each role
 
03:29:10.830 --> 03:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
complements the other if you remove one
 
03:29:14.189 --> 03:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
of the roles it upsets the balance and
 
03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
starts placing unnecessary stress and

strains on the entire

system removing the option of

find themselves needing to seek care out
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
of state perhaps and leading to

additional costs and logistical

03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
as we've heard a second provider to come
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
in to provide modernization for me for
 
03:30:02.670 --> 03:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
my patients would create a huge backlog

of appointments my current weight list
 
03:30:07.389 --> 03:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
to have another anesthesia come to my
 
03:30:09.389 --> 03:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
office is three months with the amount
 
03:30:11.309 --> 03:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
of moderate sedation cases I currently
 
03:30:13.229 --> 03:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
do this would extend to about a

do this would extend to about a
six-month

03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%

weight this delay as you can imagine
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
will be particularly detrimental in
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
emergency situations where timely
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
intervention is
 
03:30:24.670 --> 03:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
critical of course affordability is
 
03:30:27.510 --> 03:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
another crucial Factor IV sedation will
 
03:30:29.710 --> 03:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
cost three to four times more than
 
03:30:31.710 --> 03:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation and many families
 
03:30:34.590 --> 03:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
simply can't afford this making moderate
 
03:30:36.429 --> 03:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
station a more accessible and
 
03:30:38.710 --> 03:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
cost-effective option for obtaining
 
03:30:41.469 --> 03:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
necessary dental care when patients
 
03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
can't afford treatment many will end up
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
foregoing care for their child I see it
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
every day in my office and this
 
03:30:51.389 --> 03:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
continues and allows the dental disease
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
to progress and pain and suffering then
 
03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:55.150 align:start position:0%
to progress and pain and suffering then
to

03:30:55.150 --> 03:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:58.030 --> 03:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
continue I'd like to share with you at a
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
one of the the November 4th Dental board
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
meeting I invited a colleague of mine Dr
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
Sarat vieri a pediatric dentist and also
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
the chair of the aapd committee on
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
sedation in anesthesia he gra graciously
 
03:31:15.670 --> 03:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
traveled from Ohio to accompany me to
 
03:31:18.269 --> 03:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
the November 4th board meeting at the
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
meeting he attempted to provide context
 
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
and reason with the board regarding the
 
03:31:25.870 --> 03:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
proposed moderate sedation guidelines he
 
03:31:28.349 --> 03:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
stated and I quote I would like to
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
discuss why the aapd is perplexed by and
 
03:31:33.910 --> 03:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
cannot in good faith support the
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments to
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
de34 it is our assessment that this
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendment would result in increased
 
03:31:43.630 --> 03:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
suffering reduced access delays in care
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
and dangerous outcomes for the children
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
of new hampsh
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
unquote he continued by adding and I
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
quote despite the proposed regulations
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
citing a reputable Source the Ada
 
03:31:57.150 --> 03:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines New Hampshire's proposed
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is not in alignment with these
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines the proposed amendment is
 
03:32:05.309 --> 03:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
applying deep sedation and general
 
03:32:07.830 --> 03:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
anesthesia educational requirements to
 
03:32:10.590 --> 03:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation rather then aligning
 
03:32:12.630 --> 03:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
them with the moderate sedation
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
educational requirements the way in
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
which these proposed guidelines are
 
03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
written is extremely
 
03:32:18.319 --> 03:32:20.590 align:start position:0%
written is extremely
misleading

03:32:20.590 --> 03:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
misleading
 
03:32:23.229 --> 03:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
unquote he finished by saying and I
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
quote overall the proposed amendments
 
03:32:28.110 --> 03:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
make little sense other than to restrict
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
access for children and to deny
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentists from practicing an

advanced Behavior guidance technique
 
03:32:37.710 --> 03:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
that we are well trained to
 
03:32:40.269 --> 03:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
perform it is critical to note that the

New Hampshire Academy of pediatric

03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
to assist the board in a collaborative
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
effort to create minimal and moderate
 
03:32:53.710 --> 03:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
station guidelines that are clear and
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
understandable and in the Public's best
 
03:32:57.510 --> 03:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
interest in fact the
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
aapd is planning to attend a sedation
 
03:33:03.189 --> 03:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
Summit with other professional
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
organizations early next year to
 
03:33:09.630 --> 03:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
finalize a joint moderate sedation model
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
for States who use who to to use to
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
guide them and assist them in creating
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines appr moderate sedation
 
03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines and these guidelines can then
 
03:33:21.630 --> 03:33:21.640 align:start position:0%
be recognized nationally according to
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
the accepted standards of care and the

effort at this time I would like to
 
03:33:33.870 --> 03:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
share with
 
03:33:33.880 --> 03:33:35.510 align:start position:0%

you
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
two something from two different
 
03:33:39.870 --> 03:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
families that I have been asked to come
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
to this meeting to testify their
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
experiences with their children in my
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
office um neither of them were able to
 
03:33:49.030 --> 03:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
attend however I will submit to you in
 
03:33:50.790 --> 03:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
writing their letters and I would like
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
to just share an excerpt from each one
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
of them one of my patients that came to
 
03:33:59.189 --> 03:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
me recently who is a special special
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
needs patient his mother was referred to
 
03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
me after unsuccessful treatment at
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
another General Dent dental office and
 
03:34:09.550 --> 03:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
she states quote I am writing to express
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
my strong support for keeping moderate
 
03:34:13.830 --> 03:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
station as an available option in
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Dentistry as aent parent of a
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
child who has received dental care I
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
understand the critical role that
 
03:34:23.229 --> 03:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
sedation plays in ensuring a positive
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
and safe experience for children
 
03:34:27.150 --> 03:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
especially for those who may be anxious
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
fearful or require extensive dental
 
03:34:33.189 --> 03:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
procedures maintaining moderate station
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a viable option will ensure that all
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
children regardless of their individual
 
03:34:40.110 --> 03:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
challenges have access to the dental
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
care they need in a compassionate and a
 
03:34:44.910 --> 03:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
supportive environment I urge you to
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
continue to allow pediatric dentists to
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
provide this important option for
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
families like mine this is from a mother
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
from Chai Chester New
 
03:34:57.070 --> 03:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire second parent from Portsmith
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was given the option of IV
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
sedation for her child she was not
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this option and she
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
came to my office for a second opinion
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
she states I am writing in support of
 
03:35:10.349 --> 03:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
oral conscious station for children my
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
daughter recently saw Dr Mindy Hall for
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
tooth extraction that utilized oral
 
03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
sedation and the experience was
 
03:35:19.189 --> 03:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
extremely positive the procedure was
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
quick and smooth and my daughter handled
 
03:35:24.189 --> 03:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
it very well oral conscious station is a
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
much more affordable option compared to
 
03:35:28.830 --> 03:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
deep sedation additionally it provides
 
03:35:31.150 --> 03:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility as my daughter was
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
able to secure an an early appointment
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
to address her crack tooth this approach
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
proved to be efficient and effective and
 
03:35:42.590 --> 03:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
I strongly hope it remains an option for
 
03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
children given the advantages of oral
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
conscious I'm deeply concerned about any
 
03:35:50.830 --> 03:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to eliminate it as an option for
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
parents I sincerely hope Financial
 
03:36:00.429 --> 03:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
options as I've already previously
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'm here today representing 43
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentists in New Hampshire and
 
03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
over 8,000 pediatric dentists across the
 
03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
country we're all speaking with an
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
unmistakable voice reject Den 304 the
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
use of general anesia and sedation by
 
03:36:21.750 --> 03:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
dentists and require that the New
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of dental examiners to
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
go back to the drawing board and
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
generate minimal and moderate station
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
permitting and guidelines that are both
 
03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
independent from Deep sedation in
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia and comply with
 
03:36:37.229 --> 03:36:37.239 align:start position:0%
nationally accepted standards and best
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
practices the children of New Hampshire
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
deserve nothing less than our best
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
efforts to really get this right I thank
 
03:36:47.550 --> 03:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
you for your time and your consideration
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
and I would like to point out one more
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
thing regarding the RSA rules of the
 
03:36:55.189 --> 03:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
dental practice act and what it states
 
03:36:58.110 --> 03:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
in regarding minimal sedation and I do
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
not agree that it actually is in line
 
03:37:03.030 --> 03:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
with these rules and these guidelines I
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
think there's a conflict and I want to
 
03:37:06.189 --> 03:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that I bring that up to your
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
attention I have submitted an email
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
which you have in your public testimony
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
of your 131 Pages starting at page
 
03:37:20.469 --> 03:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
128 you will will see in there that de
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
30411 has no age limitation regarding
 
03:37:29.550 --> 03:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
who can perform minimal sedation on
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
patients so the age 13 has been
 
03:37:38.990 --> 03:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated under the de
 
03:37:41.790 --> 03:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
30411 so any dentist is going to be able
 
03:37:46.189 --> 03:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
to now give a child any age
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
a drug without having permitted so there
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
really is no regulation in looking over
 
03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:54.870 align:start position:0%
really is no regulation in looking over
these

03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
patients according to RSA 317 a12 it
 
03:38:03.790 --> 03:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
states in there for Pediatric minimal
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
sedation permitting and training is
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
required so if nothing else that would
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
tell you today and make you pause I
 
03:38:16.510 --> 03:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
would hope that you would really look
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
and consider that thank you questions
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:38:25.630 --> 03:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
doctor see n thank you do so do actually
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna have one clarifying so
 
03:38:29.110 --> 03:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
again you're here for
 
03:38:32.590 --> 03:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
for and Tim I'll get you um you're here
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
for uh the AAP aapd right so um the
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
American Association of pediatric
 
03:38:42.429 --> 03:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
dentists right yes so their rule only
 
03:38:44.710 --> 03:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
governs having two people in a room for
 
03:38:47.309 --> 03:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
General and deep anesthesia only is that
 
03:38:49.710 --> 03:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
correct correct but the rule that's
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
being proposed also includes moderate in
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
does uh Senator mug you thank you Mr

thanks for your testimony I appreciate
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
it sure um quick question for you of
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
your your team of lovely ladies at
 
03:39:10.110 --> 03:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
Lakeside how many of them are Pals or
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
ACLS certified so for my dental
 
03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
assistance the requirement for my
 
03:39:19.870 --> 03:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
um first and secondary dental assistants
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
to help me in Moder station is that
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're BLS certified which is not
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
require for them to be pal certified or
 
03:39:28.990 --> 03:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
ACLS certified so yourself and Dr mccan
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
are are you both either ACLS or Pal
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
certified for so I am currently both
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what's currently required
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
yes did you get that training either
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
through the hospital or through through
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
docks or DS actually I have a sedation
 
03:39:44.429 --> 03:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
course that I still attend in Florida
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
where I used to practice
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
where I um are able to accommodate and
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's specifically tail tailored for
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentists which is actually
 
03:39:55.630 --> 03:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
really helpful thank you yep sen avard
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes I'm just I I guess I must have
 
03:39:59.309 --> 03:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
missed something because I thought we
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
were only talking about deep sedation
 
03:40:03.389 --> 03:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
not moderate sedation in the
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
rules yes I want to clarify I I do think
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
um Dr Dr Hall yes um makes a good
 
03:40:13.389 --> 03:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
argument for a lack of authority in in
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
regards to the minimum sedation I would
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
need to do more research but I think
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
that is a valid reason for objection um
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'm also hearing that there's a lot of
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
legislative intent question here so
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
objection further questions from the
 
03:40:33.309 --> 03:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
represent land um thank you I just
 
03:40:35.189 --> 03:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that with the rules as
 
03:40:38.510 --> 03:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
written um it um soorry in the law it
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
says that there may also be um the Min
 
03:40:45.309 --> 03:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation that that can be a
 
03:40:46.750 --> 03:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
separate one for moderate sedation
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
separate from the deep sedation and
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
without offering a moderate sedation
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
only you're not able to provide the
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
current care that you provide for your
 
03:40:57.150 --> 03:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
patients because you wouldn't qualify
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
for the Deep sedation corre correct
 
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
because the current moderate sedation
 
03:41:03.870 --> 03:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
permit has age restrictions to it again
 
03:41:07.469 --> 03:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
over nine thank you great further
 
03:41:09.389 --> 03:41:09.399 align:start position:0%
comments seeing n thank you very much
 
03:41:09.399 --> 03:41:12.950 align:start position:0%
comments seeing n thank you very much
you're

welcome yes
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
I I do want to let there's one person
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
who wants to speak in support I think it
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
was um and I haven't I haven't gotten to
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
him yet so I'd like to at least have one
 
03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
person who wants to speak in support
 
03:41:27.790 --> 03:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
give their point of view because we've
 
03:41:30.910 --> 03:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
heard from the doctors against so uh is
 
03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:33.389 align:start position:0%
heard from the doctors against so uh is

03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
motion hey
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
guys introduce yourself sir thank you
 
03:41:44.309 --> 03:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
committee and chair my name is Dr Dwayne
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
TBO I'm a nurse anesthesiologist that
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
provides anesthesia to pediatric and
 
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
adult patients in dental offices
 
03:41:52.110 --> 03:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the big concerns that I
 
03:41:59.070 --> 03:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
see this board and the board of
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
dentistry struggle with is the question
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
of access to
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
care one of the questions that I would
 
03:42:12.149 --> 03:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
like to be asked is if access to care is
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
such an
 
03:42:16.349 --> 03:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
issue the most vulnerable population
 
03:42:18.990 --> 03:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
that we have here in this state are the
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
children that are on
 
03:42:24.910 --> 03:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I would ask how many oral
 
03:42:27.870 --> 03:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
surgeons take Medicaid or accept
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in their
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
office I do for all my
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
patients my understanding there's only a
 
03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
handful so when they talk to you about
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
access to care the issue being is
 
03:42:43.469 --> 03:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
they're not seeing those
 
03:42:46.389 --> 03:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
patients I would ask Dr Finny she may
 
03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
have a better answer than I do but my
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's only a handful
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know if she has a number but
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
with my research there was only handful
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
she might be able to get us a better
 
03:42:58.229 --> 03:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
number the other issue to access to care
 
03:43:00.750 --> 03:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
they talk about the child that quote
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
gets the baseball bat to the face or
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
falls off the um swing set and needs
 
03:43:05.720 --> 03:43:06.870 align:start position:0%
falls off the um swing set and needs
immediate

03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
03:43:10.189 --> 03:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
care they're saying that
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't have access to
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
care because there isn't an anesthesia
 
03:43:16.990 --> 03:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
provider that could perform the
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and this another one to that
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
would perform the surgical
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
procedure in most of the offices here in
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a good portion of them
 
03:43:29.189 --> 03:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
there are more than one oral surgeon in
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
that office oral surgeon are highly
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
trained professionals to provide
 
03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
anesthesia that's not in question their
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
education is not in question here at all
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
they are trained they are highly trained
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
the question is when you have an Emer
 
03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
is it better to have a separate provider
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
providing that anesthesia for that
 
03:43:53.710 --> 03:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
8-year-old and under or is it better to
 
03:43:53.720 --> 03:43:54.990 align:start position:0%
8-year-old and under or is it better to
have

03:43:54.990 --> 03:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
one that's the question you have to ask
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
yourself and the gold standard is what
 
03:44:03.910 --> 03:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital the surgery center why
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
should it be any different going into a
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
dental office that gold standard is two
 
03:44:08.399 --> 03:44:11.469 align:start position:0%
dental office that gold standard is two
separate

03:44:11.469 --> 03:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.429 --> 03:44:14.439 align:start position:0%
providers there's no reason that that
 
03:44:16.830 --> 03:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
child that falls off the swing set falls
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
off and or gets the baseball bat to the
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
face cannot be sent to an oral surgeon's
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
office that Pro that has two oral
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
surgeons there one can provide the
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and one can provide the
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
surgical procedure why doesn't this
 
03:44:34.389 --> 03:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
happen again no one wants to talk about
 
03:44:37.149 --> 03:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
it but it might be Financial just like
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's no Medicaid
 
03:44:40.269 --> 03:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
patients being taken care of or there's
 
03:44:43.070 --> 03:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
a lack thereof I should
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
say so there's no reason these patients
 
03:44:48.269 --> 03:44:48.279 align:start position:0%
can't receive care and you have to think
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
about the degree of the
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
emergency I work with surgeons and in
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
the operating room where everything's an
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
emergency because they want to get their
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
case in is this an emergency that has to
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
be done right this
 
03:45:04.830 --> 03:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
moment or is this emergency that can
 
03:45:07.950 --> 03:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
wait two hours or four hours because
 
03:45:09.630 --> 03:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
those cases could be done in the dental
 
03:45:12.510 --> 03:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
office it's the ones that are emergent
 
03:45:14.670 --> 03:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
so we have to define the definition of
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
what's emergent and what isn't
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
emergent those kids that are emergent
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
should be going to the hospital no doubt
 
03:45:21.760 --> 03:45:22.910 align:start position:0%
should be going to the hospital no doubt
about

03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
it those that are less emergent could be
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
seen later that day or maybe even the
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
following day there was a a scenario
 
03:45:34.349 --> 03:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
that was laid out where the patient
 
03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
stayed in the hospital for four or five
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
days why why wasn't that tooth taken out
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
beforehand the other thing is you're
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
talking about access to care about how
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
they say there is no oral surgery cover
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
in these covering in these hospitals why
 
03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
is that is it because the oral surgeons
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't take call so are we construing
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
safety and access to
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
care with the fact that it's an access
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
to care issue
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
because we're not seeing these
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations because of
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
financial reasons we need to weigh that
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
into this decision- making of This of
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not the board of Dentistry
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
has weighed the data weighed the
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
information and tried to come up with
 
03:46:25.189 --> 03:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
the best safest compromise for these
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
children I would say that safety trumps
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
anything access to care can be addressed
 
03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:34.229 align:start position:0%
anything access to care can be addressed
and

03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
fixed but there is no access to care
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
issue if people simply do a few extra
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
things take call see the Medicaid
 
03:46:43.279 --> 03:46:46.070 align:start position:0%
things take call see the Medicaid
patients

03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
you know there was also a scenario where
 
03:46:51.469 --> 03:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
chairman asked is there any other place
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
in medicine where deep sedation and
 
03:46:53.880 --> 03:46:54.910 align:start position:0%
in medicine where deep sedation and
general

03:46:54.910 --> 03:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
anesthesia is done by a single
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
provider respectfully
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
no that ER scenario you were given was
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
probably moderate or minimal sedation
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
though the anesthetic medications could
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
be used to deepen that anesthetic to
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
create a deep sedation in general anesth
 
03:47:19.590 --> 03:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
I and my background is 18 years working
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room providing care as
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
an ER nurse a charge nurse before I went
 
03:47:27.189 --> 03:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
to Anesthesia school and I
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly deny the fact that we
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
gave deep sedation general
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
anesthesia to fix a cut to fix a broken
 
03:47:37.469 --> 03:47:37.479 align:start position:0%
finger we gave moderate station and if
 
03:47:40.189 --> 03:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
we needed to and the person needed they
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
went to the o or o staff and anesthesia
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
staff came down to do do the actual deep
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
sedation general anesthesia that ER
 
03:47:52.510 --> 03:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.349 --> 03:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
own they also talked about their staff
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
being highly
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
trained but they won't tell you what
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
that training is that the oral surgeons
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh assistants have they say it's highly
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
trained what the reality is and it's
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
documented that they take a 36-hour home
 
03:48:11.080 --> 03:48:13.070 align:start position:0%
documented that they take a 36-hour home
study

03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
course and that's their an athesia
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
training that's going to replace me or
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
an oral surgeon or a dental
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist with a doctorate
 
03:48:26.189 --> 03:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
degree I'm sorry prior to most of these
 
03:48:27.870 --> 03:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
people actually going into the dental
 
03:48:30.670 --> 03:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
Community they were tellers at Banks
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
they were doing other things in the
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
community they they don't even have
 
03:48:39.469 --> 03:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
a there's not a standard of Education
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
out there for these dental assistants
 
03:48:45.870 --> 03:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
but we'll pull a bank true story a bank
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
teller educate them into the the the the
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon's office 5 Weeks Later have
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
them turn around and take a 36 home
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
study course and now they can monitor a
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
pediatric patient under
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
anesthesia where is the safety where is
 
03:49:03.149 --> 03:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
the safety but you're not hearing these
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
things because they glaze over them they
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
actually don't tell you the the the
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty and being the not being the
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
experts you're relying on their expert
 
03:49:16.990 --> 03:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
testimony to tell you exactly what goes
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
down in those offices and I think we're
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:26.950 --> 03:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
facts I will say this that if there are
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
187 Medicaid patients per Dr Finny being
 
03:49:33.070 --> 03:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
seen by Oral Surgeons I can tell you
 
03:49:34.269 --> 03:49:34.279 align:start position:0%
that my
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
practice sees almost that many in of
 
03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
itself never mind taking that 8
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
187 um Medicaid patients and dispersing
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
them over 50 providers my practice has
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
three we see over 100 patients a year so
 
03:49:55.870 --> 03:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
how does that equate the issue isn't the
 
03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
187 the issue isn't even how I see 100
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
the issue is the fact that they don't
 
03:50:02.349 --> 03:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
see those patients because they don't
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.070 --> 03:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
insurance now a little bit off topic
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
today but there was a article in the
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
paper recently that came across the wire
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
a 17-year-old died in a oral surgeon's
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
office taking an extraction for one
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
third Moler under deep sedation general
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
anesthesia 17 year-old larger Airway
 
03:50:35.469 --> 03:50:35.479 align:start position:0%
much more respiratory Reserve much more
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%

03:50:38.399 --> 03:50:39.670 align:start position:0%
easier to take care of than a 8-year-old
pediatric

03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
pediatric
 
03:50:42.750 --> 03:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
patient these people are dying in these
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
offices and the reality is is they're
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
not being reported because when the
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
families settle in court there's an NDA
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
done they're not allowed to talk about
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
it so again we're running into the fact
 
03:50:58.149 --> 03:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
that we don't have accurate data for how
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
many this is happening to these are just
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
deaths we're not talking about the
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
neurological impairment for from being
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
hypoxic for so long we're not talking
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
about any of these other things and
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether anybody in this room wants to
 
03:51:11.790 --> 03:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
admit it or even knows it there have
 
03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
been deaths here in New Hampshire
 
03:51:17.790 --> 03:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
under oral surgery in an oral surgeon's
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
office by an
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
adult now we're talking about pediatric
 
03:51:24.189 --> 03:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
patients here I think the board has
 
03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
struck a very very very good compromise
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I whole support their deep sedation
 
03:51:32.510 --> 03:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
and general anesthesia stance you had an
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon here testifying on behalf
 
03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
of it this oral surgeon was integral in
 
03:51:42.870 --> 03:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
researching the data using the
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
information and having gone forth to the
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
board with
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations and other information
 
03:51:55.710 --> 03:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.630 --> 03:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
considered closing is the borders
 
03:52:00.670 --> 03:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
Dentistry has weighed the access to care
 
03:52:03.149 --> 03:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
versus the cost and I don't want to be
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
the one sitting
 
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
here that has a six-year-old or an
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old ding a dental office and
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
we could have done something about
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
it access to care will come
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
safety I don't want that on my
 
03:52:19.389 --> 03:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
conscience I do I do anesthesia every
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
day for Pediatric patients throughout
 
03:52:21.479 --> 03:52:23.790 align:start position:0%
day for Pediatric patients throughout
the

03:52:23.790 --> 03:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
week I'm a separate provider and I'm not
 
03:52:27.870 --> 03:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
saying everybody has to have a separate
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
provider for moderate sedation or even
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
minimal sedation but when you do deep
 
03:52:33.469 --> 03:52:33.479 align:start position:0%
sedation and general anesthesia on a
 
03:52:36.309 --> 03:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
pediatric patient there is there is no
 
03:52:39.309 --> 03:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
room for error and there
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
staff 36- hour home study course versus
 
03:52:46.189 --> 03:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
having two separate doctorally prepared
 
03:52:48.510 --> 03:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
providers in the room the gold standard
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
is the hospital I don't I don't know
 
03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
what else to say I'll take any questions
 
03:52:55.389 --> 03:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time one question sen
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
aart just uh getting back to the
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation do these new proposed
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
rules affect the moderate U sedation for
 
03:53:08.670 --> 03:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you and thank you for
 
03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
bringing a Viewpoint that wasn't
 
03:53:14.910 --> 03:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
expressed by as many other people um you
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
did reference them and their specific um
 
03:53:20.349 --> 03:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
benefits from the rules I just would
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
like to clarify you're you're a nurses
 
03:53:26.790 --> 03:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
nesst yes and um so with that then these
 
03:53:28.349 --> 03:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
there would be more procedures that are
 
03:53:30.070 --> 03:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
required to be attended by people with
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
the same lcer as you
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
correct could you clarify that so I can
 
03:53:36.429 --> 03:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
answer you very more specific because I
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
think I might be misunderstanding you I
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
I you had you had made statement saying
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
that there were there there was a
 
03:53:44.670 --> 03:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
financial interest from people people
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
who did not want to add another provider
 
03:53:48.910 --> 03:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
to the treatment of of these patients
 
03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
and you are part of that group who would
 
03:53:53.070 --> 03:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
be required I just wanted to clarify I'm
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
not accusing you of bias I just want to
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
highlight that that there's multiple
 
03:53:59.950 --> 03:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
sides to an issue yes and and to answer
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
your question now I understand where
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
you're going so when someone has
 
03:54:05.349 --> 03:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
provided anesthesia in a dental office
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
there are two bills there's an
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesia Bill and there's a surgical
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill right so when one provider provides
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
that service they double dip they get
 
03:54:18.750 --> 03:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
both anesthesia and the surgical
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
procedure when I come in and provide the
 
03:54:21.040 --> 03:54:22.030 align:start position:0%
procedure when I come in and provide the
same

03:54:22.030 --> 03:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
anesthesia I get the anesthesia fee the
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
dentist gets the the surgical fee for
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
instance Medicaid I don't get paid
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
anymore than anybody else when I see
 
03:54:33.790 --> 03:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid patient in that dental
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
office no more for anesthesia than any
 
03:54:38.429 --> 03:54:38.439 align:start position:0%
oral surgeon would any Dental
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist would or any physician
 
03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist would we get paid the
 
03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
same the difference is both of those
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
fees the surgery and the anesthesia
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
field is not going to one person it
 
03:54:53.670 --> 03:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
would be going to two separate people
 
03:54:56.910 --> 03:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
there is no additional cost let me
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
underline that no additional
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
cost for that scenario for that Medicaid
 
03:55:05.830 --> 03:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
patient thank you I I could say there's
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
no reason to say anymore I'm just
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
where're else at it looks like there's
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
no more questions way I'm going to let
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like you want to speak one
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
more time real quick I'm going to let
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
her from Medicaid because because I
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
think she had some might answer some
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
you I just want to clarify something
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
that's very important some of the
 
03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that um Dwayne was telling you
 
03:55:35.269 --> 03:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
that 187 patients that I said to you
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
those are specifically children under
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
the age of nine who had deep sedation
 
03:55:44.830 --> 03:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 2024 that is not
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
the total of
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covered children who were
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
treated by oral surgeons in a year trust
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
me it is thousands and thousands more
 
03:55:59.550 --> 03:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
than that so I ju I just want you to
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand I was speaking specifically
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
about the number of children who had
 
03:56:06.910 --> 03:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
deep sedation in one fiscal
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
year okay I just have one clarification
 
03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
item on what you were talking about so
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
the comment was made of the number of
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons in the State and the
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
number that take Medicaid and the and
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
the Delta between those two do you have
 
03:56:20.309 --> 03:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
any idea what that looks like I I
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
honestly cannot give you a number
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
without looking at my current um list uh
 
03:56:30.790 --> 03:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
but it is more than a handful and um we
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
also have you know two we have two
 
03:56:35.149 --> 03:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
different benefits now there is one for
 
03:56:37.710 --> 03:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
children one for adults and we are
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
actively recruiting to increase both of
 
03:56:42.910 --> 03:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
those networks but they are much more
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
robust today than they were five years
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
ago thank you anything else see I
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chair I move to
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
preliminarily object to this rule on the
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
grounds that doesn't meet the public
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
interest for not properly well among
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
other things not properly addressing the
 
03:57:08.110 --> 03:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between moderate and deep
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
sedation and other issues brought up by
 
03:57:14.429 --> 03:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
the public testimony
 
03:57:18.670 --> 03:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
also that it's missing a leg a an age
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
limit in
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
20411 which is required by Statute
 
03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
second M Mr chair I'm just to clarify
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
for I'm sorry go ahead so we get the
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
record right so representative Maguire
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
made a motion to preliminary object and
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
it was second in by representative was a
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
tie sorry I just heard it from over
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
there so so Mr chair the preliminary
 
03:57:45.870 --> 03:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
objection what happens from there so the
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection I actually why
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
have staff answer that so preliminary
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
objection they'll go back to the agency
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they'll have a chance to
 
03:57:54.510 --> 03:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
understanding look at our objection and
 
03:57:56.469 --> 03:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
maybe redesign the uh rule right so
 
03:57:58.590 --> 03:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
they'll come back to us the revised rule
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you 45 days yes they have 45 days
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
to respond and then after that 45 days
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
jail car will have 50 days both
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
extended any further discussion on
 
03:58:15.070 --> 03:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection jection uh thank
 
03:58:17.910 --> 03:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman and uh member I I
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
found um several areas where it did see
 
03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
in the legislative intent where I saw
 
03:58:22.870 --> 03:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
the language was different than the
 
03:58:26.910 --> 03:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
rules um the first being in 12 ah1 the
 
03:58:28.950 --> 03:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
third sentence permits that exemption
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
for oral and maxial surgeons um that's
 
03:58:34.030 --> 03:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
permitted and it's not allowed and if
 
03:58:35.469 --> 03:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
you look at the public interest and the
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
lack of access I thought that that
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
specific part of the law might make
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
sense to call out um then also in 12 ad
 
03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
it allows for both General deep moderate
 
03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
permits or moderate permits but I don't
 
03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
see a moderate permit that's permitted
 
03:58:54.149 --> 03:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
for Pediatric patients and when you
 
03:58:56.189 --> 03:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
combine that with the Authority Under 12
 
03:58:58.510 --> 03:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
ah that provides for the additional
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
requirements for children under 13 for
 
03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
General and deep sedation it doesn't
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
provide for that differentiation for
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
moderate sedation for those pediatric
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
patients um so I see that as a potential
 
03:59:12.790 --> 03:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that's conflicting um
 
03:59:15.309 --> 03:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
with with how the rules were drafted
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
since they don't allow a moderate permit
 
03:59:20.149 --> 03:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
for all ages um and then lastly um it
 
03:59:22.590 --> 03:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
was mentioned that in 12cc there
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
requires a permit for met minimal
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
sedation and that's not in rules that
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
was brought up by somebody testifying
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
but I I didn't have a chance to look at
 
03:59:31.630 --> 03:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
that section so I'm just sort of tossing
 
03:59:31.640 --> 03:59:32.389 align:start position:0%
that section so I'm just sort of tossing
that

03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
out did you get all
 
03:59:38.349 --> 03:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
that any further discussion so the
 
03:59:42.870 --> 03:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
motion on on table is uh does Maguire
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
want to amend her
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
objection to include what represented
 
03:59:50.070 --> 03:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for
 
03:59:53.070 --> 03:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
that any further discussion seeing the
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
motion is to preliminary object based on
 
03:59:56.349 --> 03:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
the out guidelines that were outlined
 
03:59:58.750 --> 03:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say I I all those
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
opposed nay no the eyes have it and
 
04:00:03.030 --> 04:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
there's a preliminary objection the
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
agency can come back and uh address
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
Industry all right so why don't we take
 
04:00:17.590 --> 04:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
like a 10minute break let people get up
 
04:00:19.469 --> 04:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
stretch their legs use the restroom that
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
kind of thing we'll be back here at 1:10
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%

04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
at your you do not you are not required
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
because we've already had testimony
 
04:14:00.680 --> 04:14:08.550 align:start position:0%
because we've already had testimony
twice

04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
so well you could if you want
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
to you don't want we're going to get and
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
open up uh and come back to jail car and
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
I am yeah so we come back to order um
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on to objection
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
responses Solid Waste programs landfill
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
requirements rule o
 
04:14:33.550 --> 04:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
2474 and um we'll start with the staff
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to the agency if you
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
guys want to come up you can get ready
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
all right so um the objection response
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
was returned from the agent genc and no
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
changes were made to the RO text I have
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
no substantive comments on the RO text
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
the dees did
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
um try to address the reasons for
 
04:14:58.990 --> 04:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
objection including um the dees states
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
that the rules were more projective than
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
the current rules and that um
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
they um responded to public comment and
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
considered public comment that's
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
evidenced by their 26 page summary of
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
comment ments and exhibit two in the
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
packet that has the spreadsheet of all
 
04:15:22.109 --> 04:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
comments and um they stated that there
 
04:15:24.910 --> 04:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
were no um Communications with
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders outside of the ruem
 
04:15:32.149 --> 04:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
process and I think that um eliminates
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the bases for objections that that
 
04:15:35.040 --> 04:15:35.830 align:start position:0%
the the bases for objections that that
were

04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:15:38.670 --> 04:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
raised and so I have no more further com
 
04:15:38.680 --> 04:15:40.870 align:start position:0%
raised and so I have no more further com
comments

04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:15:43.389 --> 04:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
great introduce yourself guys good
 
04:15:45.149 --> 04:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm assistant Commissioner
 
04:15:46.750 --> 04:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
Adam kpo at the Department of
 
04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and I here with
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
me uh Mike whimet with the waste
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
management division um so I'll just give
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
a quick intro and I'll hand it over to
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
to Mike but um you know we we received a
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection the last time we
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
were at JL car um we feel that we have
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
responded to the reasons for the
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
objection there were three reasons uh um
 
04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
you know and we we believe that these
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
rules are are much more protective than
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
the current existing
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
rules um and beyond that I you know the
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that we also uh provided
 
04:16:31.149 --> 04:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity for public comment
 
04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
through the process uh we I would argue
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
we went above and beyond uh the required
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh process for public comment when
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
creating rules and doing rul making uh
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
under five 41A and uh so I think th
 
04:16:50.189 --> 04:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
those two points really um encapsulate
 
04:16:51.990 --> 04:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
many of many of the reasons that that
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
went into doing a preliminary objection
 
04:16:55.830 --> 04:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll hand it over to Mike to
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
kind of go into more detail uh but one
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
of the other things I would I would like
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
to add is that these rules are more
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
protective in 27 27 different areas and
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
in no case are less protective than to
 
04:17:12.670 --> 04:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health and the environment than
 
04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
the current existing rules and so Mike I
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to go into that
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
or um representative
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire yes thank you based on that
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
response I would like to move to approve
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
second okay it's I speak on speak it's
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
been moved by representative Maguire and
 
04:17:37.710 --> 04:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator avard um and you may
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you Mr chair
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
I want to approve the rule rule which is
 
04:17:46.349 --> 04:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
more protective than the 10 plus year
 
04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
old rules we have currently effect in
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
effect because we need
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
to settle it and go with this improved
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
level of protection they are not perfect
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
but most of the issues we have heard
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
from and we've had voluminous public
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
testimony appear to be based more on the
 
04:18:12.199 --> 04:18:13.510 align:start position:0%
testimony appear to be based more on the
policy

04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
for landfills than on the specifics of
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
the rules and I know there are more than
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
three bills coming in this year that
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
address the policy of
 
04:18:26.319 --> 04:18:28.429 align:start position:0%
address the policy of
landfills

04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
and I would like to have a better
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
Baseline in our rule in the rules before
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
we settle the issue of the policy be any
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
policy and because if any of those bills
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
pass and change the requirements the
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
rules will have to be updated to
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate those
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
changes and I would that that's my major
 
04:18:56.950 --> 04:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
purpose is to separate the policy
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
discussion which
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
is important from the rules discussion
 
04:19:06.030 --> 04:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
and jel car is not a policy committee we
 
04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
can only go by what's currently in the
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
laws so I'm that's why I moved to
 
04:19:14.309 --> 04:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
approve the the
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
rule any comments any comments from
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr
 
04:19:26.670 --> 04:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
chairman so I will be opposing the
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
motion uh because uh I I feel that the
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh statement that the um response of the
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
agency uh to the fact that these rules
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
are better than the existing rules
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
proposed rules are better than the
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
existing rules uh is uh is um almost
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to the uh amount of
 
04:19:54.910 --> 04:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
opposition that the these rules have
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
received from the public um and the fact
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
that they may be better in a whole
 
04:20:03.510 --> 04:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
series of ways does not mean that better
 
04:20:03.520 --> 04:20:04.550 align:start position:0%
series of ways does not mean that better
is

04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
good uh better is not a sufficient
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
response um these rules are not uh
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
protect Ive enough uh and the fact that
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
they may be better than the existing
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
rules is is is is very weak in my
 
04:20:25.990 --> 04:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
opinion uh and uh but I I I want to have
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for uh the the argument
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
to be made with regard to a number of
 
04:20:36.389 --> 04:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
other aspects um of uh the opposition
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
that we've SE that we have heard and
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
seen um and but also in with with regard
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
to the objection bases that
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's motion uh was
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
based on and uh that this committee
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously in support of so I I
 
04:20:59.950 --> 04:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
think the the the the um agencies uh
 
04:21:03.229 --> 04:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
categorical uh defense of their response
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
or non-response as the case may be uh
 
04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be further explored and we need
 
04:21:08.680 --> 04:21:10.670 align:start position:0%
needs to be further explored and we need
to

04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:12.830 --> 04:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
proceed open to further disc question
 
04:21:12.840 --> 04:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
proceed open to further disc question
and

04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
comment representative Leon uh thank you
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um looking at this you know
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a challenging situation to
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
be in because I don't think that the
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
rules that are in there as protective as
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
they should be but I've been trying to
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
look and see where this doesn't meet
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
what the statutory guidelines are I'm
 
04:21:32.750 --> 04:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to see where there is something
 
04:21:34.750 --> 04:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
that is a role for jel card to say this
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
because if we look to the the public
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
benefit we look to these a lot of those
 
04:21:42.109 --> 04:21:42.119 align:start position:0%
issues about what um environmental
 
04:21:44.189 --> 04:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
policy should be are settled in the
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and policy committees um and
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking forward to the
 
04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on it because I think people
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
are becoming a lot more educated on this
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
issue um and as much as I would like to
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
do something here just because you know
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
I want to protect the the water and the
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
soil and and whatnot we also need to
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
look at what the role is of Jael car and
 
04:22:05.229 --> 04:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
um if we overstep things here we're
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to set out everything out of whack
 
04:22:09.309 --> 04:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
as well for every other rule that comes
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
in front of us so even though we may
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
personally feel that we want want to do
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
something we need to act in our role um
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
as Jael car not as an advocate and not
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh trying to push policy in this
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
committee further
 
04:22:24.910 --> 04:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
discussion so I I am going to make the
 
04:22:27.149 --> 04:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
same statement as as uh representative
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
Leon understanding this is not a policy
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
committee the question is as the law was
 
04:22:33.109 --> 04:22:33.119 align:start position:0%
passed and the rules were drafted based
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
on the law was passed did they meet the
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
conditions and terms of the law that was
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
passed and there's been no objection to
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
that everyone thinks that it meets the
 
04:22:42.670 --> 04:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
minimum requirement of the law um which
 
04:22:44.269 --> 04:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
is one of the criteria for J car's
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
objection so um the secondary purpose
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
was again um the the declared intent of
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not it protects the natural
 
04:22:53.309 --> 04:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
environment everything else it's clear
 
04:22:55.950 --> 04:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
that these rules while may not go as far
 
04:22:58.590 --> 04:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
as some want that's a policy decision
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
not a discussion of of for this body um
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's a discussion for the agriculture
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
environment committee and and the energy
 
04:23:08.590 --> 04:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
environment committee uh in the house
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
and the Senate um so from the agency
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
response and from their objection
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
response it's clear that again there are
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
multiple areas where these new rules are
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh more restrictive than the current
 
04:23:22.950 --> 04:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
rules which go further to protect our
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
environment protect our water and
 
04:23:26.429 --> 04:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
protect everything El protect uh the New
 
04:23:30.070 --> 04:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Beauty and so um again going
 
04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
beyond that is not again individual
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
members here may think it doesn't go far
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
enough but that's what the purposes of
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
bills are for is for you to write a bill
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
and and you can push it further if you
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
think they didn't go far enough so um
 
04:23:44.229 --> 04:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
with that if there's no further comment
 
04:23:46.349 --> 04:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move to a vote and we'll do
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.550 --> 04:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
a thank you for the question so because
 
04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
there was a motion made the after a
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
motion is made public testimony is
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
generally not accepted in any public
 
04:24:05.070 --> 04:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
Committee in the legislature um it
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
becomes a discussion on the on the
 
04:24:09.149 --> 04:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
motion in and of itself uh is what
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
happens amongst the members of the
 
04:24:13.710 --> 04:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
committee so because the representative
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
Maguire chose to make a motion and it
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
was seconded by representative avard
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
that ended uh ended discussion um
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
amongst a a public body and the agency
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
and move strictly to a discussion
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
legislature all right that being said is
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%

04:25:49.870 --> 04:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
presented all right I'm g go back to the
 
04:25:49.880 --> 04:26:22.269 align:start position:0%
presented all right I'm g go back to the
agenda

04:26:22.269 --> 04:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
all right so next item of business is um
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
is with uh Doug we'll turn it over to
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
you for the last item of business number
 
04:26:33.109 --> 04:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
five under other business we have final
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
proposal cover sheet report
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
implementation of expired rules and the
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
filing contained blah blah blah as well
 
04:26:41.349 --> 04:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
as setting our meeting dates so all
 
04:26:42.670 --> 04:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
right let's we I I guess we'll just
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
start right at the top uh the first
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
thing in front of you is the cover sheet
 
04:26:47.309 --> 04:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
for the final proposal there was
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
legislation last session that made
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
changes to 541 or yes 541a that's going
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
to require reports of implementation of
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
expired rules uh we're requesting that
 
04:27:01.710 --> 04:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
we add question 14 to our cover sheet so
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
that if the form isn't required the
 
04:27:06.109 --> 04:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
agency can just check Na and if it is
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
required it's something we know to look
 
04:27:09.630 --> 04:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
at and review um we're still going to be
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
doing that review but it's just going to
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
make it easier in the first instance
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
so does this require action and a vote
 
04:27:19.870 --> 04:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay so uh I move we allow for
 
04:27:22.109 --> 04:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh the adoption of the final proposal
 
04:27:25.630 --> 04:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
cover sheet second I'm sorry who said
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
second I did all right move by set L
 
04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
second by representative Lynn is there
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all those in
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
favor say I I all oppos n the eyes have
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
it and it's done the next up is our
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
meeting G
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
meeting dat so there is one there is one
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
minor request so this is a very
 
04:27:49.269 --> 04:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
interesting thing it's it's a bizarre
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
request but the um bar midyear meeting
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
is actually on Friday February
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
21st and in order for us to attend we
 
04:28:00.429 --> 04:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
could not be a jail car that day so we
 
04:28:01.630 --> 04:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
were simply going to ask if we could
 
04:28:03.870 --> 04:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
move that meeting to Thursday February
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
20th but I do understand it is the week
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
before the recess which is also a very
 
04:28:09.199 --> 04:28:10.309 align:start position:0%
before the recess which is also a very
busy

04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
busy
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
week so but I thought thought we'd make
 
04:28:16.510 --> 04:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
the ask so let me so what so the
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
question is again the the Friday the
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
21st of February um J car the staff has
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
a meeting that they need to attend so
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be able to be here for
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
that that we clarify would like to
 
04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
attend we don't need to be nobody will
 
04:28:32.910 --> 04:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
miss us and so that conflicts with our
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
meeting date so they're wanting to move
 
04:28:35.950 --> 04:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
it back but the problem with moving it
 
04:28:38.109 --> 04:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
back would be that there's probably a
 
04:28:39.309 --> 04:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
high likelihood we're going to be
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
meeting on the 20th on Thursday
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm open to other discussion
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
or other ideas on that if we have any
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
mire I'd like to say it's a very high
 
04:28:53.710 --> 04:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
probability the house at least will be
 
04:28:56.910 --> 04:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
meeting that Thursday right um You
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
gentlemen maybe and the Senators may be
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
more flexible than we are but we're
 
04:29:06.070 --> 04:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
going to be meeting the 20th so I I
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
can't support that we can try to to make
 
04:29:12.389 --> 04:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
it a very abbreviated agenda though yeah
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
let's we'll work on toward we'll work
 
04:29:13.560 --> 04:29:14.670 align:start position:0%
let's we'll work on toward we'll work
towards

04:29:14.670 --> 04:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
towards
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
that um I move that we adopt the
 
04:29:21.309 --> 04:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
tentative meeting schedule second it's
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
been moved and second to adopt the
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
meeting schedule as written and
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
presented any further discussion hearing
 
04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
none all those in favor say I I all
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
oppos nay guys have it who was the
 
04:29:31.199 --> 04:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
oppos nay guys have it who was the
second

04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
oh last up is an emergency rule that was
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
put in on the voluntary registry for
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
Recovery houses and Doug is going to
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
speak to that for us because the AGC had
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
had to believe so this was an emergency
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
rule that was actually on the agenda
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
last month and got pushed forward I do
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
want to lead with I don't think there's
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
any ground for objection essentially the
 
04:29:53.229 --> 04:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
statute says that you have to use New
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire car Nar standards uh or
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
something similar the current rule
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
specifically calls out the New Hampshire
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
Corps and so under the current rules we
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do what we need to
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
do in the state and there's also threat
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
of litigation because those rules are uh
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
copyrighted so basically the department
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
is changing the rule to adjust so that
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
the agency selected under an RFP can
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
proceed have they've been selected and
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
then the department is going to file
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
rules in January to make that a formal
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
Thing official regular rule meeting so
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
if members know agencies are allowed to
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
file emergency rules for basically two
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
reasons fiscal and public health um and
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
so if there's a fiscal impact of
 
04:30:40.990 --> 04:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
something or a public health impact of
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
something need to get a rule in place
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
right now and avoid Ru making they're
 
04:30:46.990 --> 04:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to put a a temporary rule in but
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
as part of that process emergency rule
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
they must then open Ru making to adopt
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
or deal with that rule so and that's
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
what and so we would have an we if if we
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't think that it was a public health
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
issue which or even a financial issue
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
with a lawsuit pending and the
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
possibility of of not meeting the
 
04:31:05.149 --> 04:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
requirements of that we have recovery
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
houses so arguably you have both cases
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so we have both cases I think in this
 
04:31:10.510 --> 04:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
case for the agency to make an emergency
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
rule so there would be no reason for us
 
04:31:12.479 --> 04:31:13.950 align:start position:0%
rule so there would be no reason for us
to

04:31:13.950 --> 04:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
object um yes can you just tell us the
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
procedure like how long they have to to
 
04:31:21.109 --> 04:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
submit new
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
rules and when we'd have to act on them
 
04:31:25.149 --> 04:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
so the emergency rule would be in effect
 
04:31:27.790 --> 04:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
for 180
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
days and then if that were just set to
 
04:31:32.590 --> 04:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
expire the regular rule would just take
 
04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
its place but the department plans on
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
enter regular R making before that
 
04:31:41.229 --> 04:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
happens the emergency rule cannot be
 
04:31:41.239 --> 04:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
happens the emergency rule cannot be
removed

04:31:43.030 --> 04:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
removed
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
right anything else to come before the
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
committee I then j a motion to adjourn
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
second a second all those in favor say I
 
04:31:54.149 --> 04:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
I just pick any two senators they all
 
04:31:57.790 --> 04:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
said yes to both
 
04:31:57.800 --> 04:32:10.830 align:start position:0%
said yes to both
so

04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
