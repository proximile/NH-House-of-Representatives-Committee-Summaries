00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
elected aco
 
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
elected aco
and

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
when the warren article passed um
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
the warrant article was
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
rather short and did not have any
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
oversight or accountability provisions
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
in said one article so this particular
 
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.950 align:start position:0%
in said one article so this particular
bill

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
we just provide for oversight and
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
accountability of the position
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
and it's as simple as that
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
this position has been back and forth
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
between a uh
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
an appointed position by the border
 
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
an appointed position by the border
selectmen

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
subsequently made an electric position
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
then back to an appointed position and
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
now apparently an elected position so
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
over the past decade there's been um
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
some gaps in coverage and services
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
needed in these particular areas hence
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill to make things a
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
little more streamlined and get the
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
citizens in danville and the animals in
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
danville a little bit better in
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
streamlined care with proper oversight
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
and accountability and it's as simple as
 
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
and accountability and it's as simple as
that

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions for
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative wallace
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
mr i do
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
please go ahead
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.430 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative wallace is this position
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
an elected position across the state or
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
only specific to some counties
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative it's my understanding
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
that danville may be the only town with
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
an elected aco in the state although i'm
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
not 100 certain of that
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
but that being said any elected position
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
in any town needs to have oversight and
 
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
in any town needs to have oversight and
accountability

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
especially for uh background checks for
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have the appropriate
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
people uh in these positions um this is
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
not about the person that holds the bill
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh she's been hosted position presently
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is about anybody that holds any
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
elected position in any municipality in
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative porter has her hand
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
up mr chair yes please go ahead
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
the town clerk in hillsborough was
 
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
the town clerk in hillsborough was
elected

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
elected
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
would that mean that the select board
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
can you answer that question for me
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
and the select board
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
discipline the town clerk
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge that's an excellent question
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of that but i suspect that
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
there is oversight
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh and accountability for all positions
 
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
uh and accountability for all positions
um

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know in the event of any
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
male administration or uh
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
misconduct there is there is a method of
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so if i got
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
this correct
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
this is the only town that has an
 
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.230 align:start position:0%
this is the only town that has an
elected

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
elected
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
animal control officer right now is that
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
that appears to be the case
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative and a follow-up uh mr
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please go ahead
 
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.710 align:start position:0%
chairman yes please go ahead
so

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
my guess is it's the prerogative of the
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
town itself
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
to decide to have it either elected or
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
an or a um a non-elected position is
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct and typically when uh
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
are put into a position there are
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
if that's done by a warrant article the
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
the details of the authority and
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
oversight are incorporated into said
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
warren article which didn't happen which
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
was probably just an oversight in this
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
case i don't believe it was there was
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
any nefarious or malicious malicious
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
intent that oversight and accountability
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't written into the ward article
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill is coming
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
forward just because of
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
its administrative challenge for the
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
town presently as you can imagine
 
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.069 align:start position:0%
town presently as you can imagine
um

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
the position was an appointed position
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
as recently as two years ago and as long
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
as 10 years ago and it's going back and
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
forth a couple of times in the interim
 
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.870 align:start position:0%
forth a couple of times in the interim
uh

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman could i have a third
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up i'm sorry yes go ahead
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
i don't want to sound so
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
if if they can change it from
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
elected to non-elected and back and
 
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.949 align:start position:0%
elected to non-elected and back and
forth

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
why are we as a legislature getting
 
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
why are we as a legislature getting
involved

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
the reason is as this has gone back and
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
forth so many times uh we don't have
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
when the the people of the town and the
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
animals in the town are not getting the
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
level of service
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
that they should be getting okay so
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking to tighten that up
 
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.069 align:start position:0%
we're looking to tighten that up
and

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
absent a another warrant article the
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
only method by which to do this is to
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
make it a parallel position just like
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
all other elected positions like the
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
road agent which reports to the board of
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
selectmen every position including ours
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
we do have uh oversight and
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
accountability in some manner um
 
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.430 align:start position:0%
accountability in some manner um
and

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
currently the uh the elected aco also
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
sits on the board of selectmen which
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
would be the oversight and governing
 
00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:41.110 align:start position:0%
would be the oversight and governing
body

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh before i go to the next uh
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
question i just wanted to report we've
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
had a lot of folks sign in on this build
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've had 156 people sign in to support
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
the bill and 47 sided
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%

no uh position on the bill
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh we we did have a suggestion
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
which was that uh the committee amended
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
the bill to move
 
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.550 align:start position:0%
the bill to move
the

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
the reference from chapter 42 to chapter
 
00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:38.389 align:start position:0%
the reference from chapter 42 to chapter
41.

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
41.
 
00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.190 align:start position:0%
41.
and

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is the sponsor
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
places this
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill in chapter 42
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh which is the oath taken by town
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
officers uh chapter
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
and it seemed more appropriate that
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
would be chapter 41 which is the
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh the chapter which
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
which basically lists all of the
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
different positions um in the town and
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
whether they're elected appointed or
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
whether the town has an option for that
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
seeing that i recognize representatives
 
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:23.990 align:start position:0%

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
would provide the oversight and
accountability

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
for design of wellness
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
support selectmen just like we currently

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.790 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
yes

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
this way oh yes i'm sorry representative
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i'm a selectman in a
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
uh a an adjoining
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
town of hampstead and uh slutman
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh there also and it seems to me that
 
00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:42.069 align:start position:0%
uh there also and it seems to me that
this

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill does what we would like to see done
 
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
bill does what we would like to see done
in

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
and is done in most every town
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh but it does not i think it's we've
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
been misled somewhat
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
uh that this
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
position is still elected will continue
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
to be elected unless the town changes
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
from elected to unappointed my
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill does
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
nothing other than make sure that there
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
is some accountability
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
within the town by the selectmen uh or
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
for anybody that's sitting in this
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
position that's elected
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't take
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
take the position out of the elected
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
category and put it in appointed that is
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you one last question from the
 
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.630 align:start position:0%
thank you one last question from the
chair

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
to representative wallace why is this
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
needed now after after uh
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is needed now because the town
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
electric voted to make the animal
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
control officer position an elected
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
position but the warren article doing so
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
did not specify the ways and means by
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
which the position would be governed
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
this bill simply sets forth a manner by
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
which the position shall be administered
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%

disenfranchise the voters of danville's
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
people's choices and trying to
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
invalidate our votes because we turned

out in large numbers for these elections
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
that you people would understand that
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is just this is um
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
it has nothing
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's taken away the the voter's choice
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
and again citizen's petitions can be
 
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.430 align:start position:0%
and again citizen's petitions can be
changed

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
um as you know um
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
in a deliberative session
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for your testimony is
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
there anybody in the committee that has
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yes representative guthrie
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for coming and giving your
 
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.830 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for coming and giving your
testimony

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know if you
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
recall i asked a previous question
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
has to be clarified that this is not
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
taking away
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
the rights of the
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
voters of the town uh it'll still be
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
elected position we would not
 
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.669 align:start position:0%
elected position we would not
be

00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
presumptuous enough to take that away
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
my question to you is do you feel that
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
there should be any oversight at all
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
to the pursuit your position and why
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
so it would be taking away the rights of
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
the voters you'd be taking away the
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
right right of the voters to vote for
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
who they would like to be in that
 
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.269 align:start position:0%
who they would like to be in that
position

00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i must have not have been
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
clear if i could mr chairman this bill
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
do anything about whether it's an
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed position this bill
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
would uh continue
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
the elected position and the people in
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
danville would have an opportunity to
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
vote for whomever they wish
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is a question of whether or not
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
that position should have oversight and
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
my question is to you is do you think
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
there should be any oversight for this
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
it would it would be taking away the
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
voters right who they put in there
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
because you have a board a board of
 
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
because you have a board a board of
selectmen

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.790 align:start position:0%
selectmen
could

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
and have
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why he became
 
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.069 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why he became
elected

00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
elected
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
could remove somebody from that position
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
and put whoever they want in the
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
position that would take away the voters
 
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.190 align:start position:0%
position that would take away the voters
choice

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
all right we have a question from
 
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.190 align:start position:0%
all right we have a question from
representatives

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question is for
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative wallace
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming in and testifying
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
today i'm just wondering
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure why this bill is
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
being put forward
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
right now can you give me a little
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh thank you
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
for the question uh i will say asked and
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
answered we did uh that question was
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
asked earlier i'll repeat my answer
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry i must have missed it but
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for repeating
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes uh you're entirely welcome
 
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
yes uh you're entirely welcome
representative

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
why is this needed now because the town
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
electorate voted to make the animal
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
control officer position an elected
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
position but the warren article doing so
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
did not specify the lanes the ways and
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
means by which the position would be
 
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.310 align:start position:0%
means by which the position would be
governed

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
governed
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill simply sets forth a man by
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
which the position shall be administered
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
and next we have representatives davis
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um this is a question
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
also for representative wallace and
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
representative

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
i have um kind of a three-part question
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it speaks to structure as opposed to
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
the specific uh
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
issues involved with this particular
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
bill and one is that
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
um as uh nate grays pointed out earlier
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
the section the rsa that the
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed to amend
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
has to do with taking oaths of office
 
00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:19.270 align:start position:0%
has to do with taking oaths of office
and

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
the animal control officer would be the
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
only officer required to take an oath
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
that has this kind of a delineation of
 
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:31.750 align:start position:0%
that has this kind of a delineation of
responsibilities

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
and consequences
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
for responsibilities so
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
my question is why in this particular
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
rsa and not in another
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then my other question has to do
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
with the terms of selectmen
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
in this town versus the terms of the
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
animal control officer do they always
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
coincide or can they be different and
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
the reason i ask the question
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
is if a particular board of selectmen
 
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
is if a particular board of selectmen
has

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
prior has priorities and strategies in
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
in mind for a particular animal control
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
officer and their terms do not coincide
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
then does a new border selectmen have
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to impose new priorities
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative let me address the first
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
first of course um
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
when this was brought forward um i was
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about this from a uh an
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
existing position standpoint so that's
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
why i focused on the rsa 42.09
 
00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
why i focused on the rsa 42.09
but

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is not my forte the municipal
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
county area that's where you folks come
 
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:44.790 align:start position:0%
county area that's where you folks come
in

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
and if it makes more sense to amend this
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
to uh have the governing statute be 41.2
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly on board with that would
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
be happy to make the amendment
 
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.990 align:start position:0%
be happy to make the amendment
um

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the second question um the warrant
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
article show has the aco be elected
 
00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:03.829 align:start position:0%
article show has the aco be elected
annually

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
annually
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
our boards of border select members have
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
different tenures um
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
matter that the uh the border sector
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
wishes to govern
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
well i don't know that that's an issue
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
presently because our current animal
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
control officer holds two positions in
 
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.829 align:start position:0%
control officer holds two positions in
town

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
one is aco and also a member of the
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen so
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
i i don't see what the problem would be
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh unless there's a conflict of one
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
supervising oneself but
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
given that set of circumstances i don't
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
think there should be a pushback from
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
the current aco she would be in fact
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
have a vote in her own supervision and
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
oversight would she not
 
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.670 align:start position:0%
oversight would she not
no

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.470 align:start position:0%
no
okay

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
next i'm going to move on to
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes um so my questions for miss joe
 
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.430 align:start position:0%
yes um so my questions for miss joe
hansen

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
hansen
 
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.270 align:start position:0%
hansen
so

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering why
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
it is precisely that
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
danville is the only town that has an
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%

that
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
issues with animal control that require
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
it to hold elections to choose between
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
people for this position
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
this position was created
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
because of small town politics
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%

that the provisions would apply to only

one animal control officer in the state
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%

last week um so you do have a copy of my
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony i was looking at this
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of giving you a
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
couple of examples where we believe
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
there would be value
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
in providing some consistency around
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
oversight and supervision for animal
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
control officers
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
and our reference was to rsa 466
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
section 1c
 
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.309 align:start position:0%
section 1c
which

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
as everyone has acknowledged provides
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
great deal of discretion to the new
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire towns
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
as to how they will
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
provide these animal control services
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
in that language you'll see
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh it can be either an elected appointed
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
hired or subcontracted position and so
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
the testimony we submitted was really in
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
the spirit of saying we support
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
oversight and to please look at this
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
section of the law so that there would
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%

so again i am the lieutenant in the town
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
of danville new hampshire and
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
i do support this bill and the reason
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
being is as far as i know we are the
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
only town in the state of new hampshire
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
that deals with an elected animal
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
control officer
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
i've been listening along the way here
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i do just want to stress again we're
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
not looking to change
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
this position being elected um i care a
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
lot about these residents in town as
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
well and it is really important to me
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
that these residents have
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
someone to rely on to hold this position
 
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.990 align:start position:0%
someone to rely on to hold this position
accountable

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
in my position
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
we receive animal control calls at the
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
pd that we have to forward to our
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
rockingham county sheriff's department
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
who handles dispatching
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
we also receive complaints
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
about our animal control officer we are
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
not able to do anything about those
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
types of complaints when we get them
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
because the animal control position is
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
not part of the police department as it
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
is in so many other towns in the state
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
so when these complaints come our way we
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
direct them to the board of selectmen
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
quite frankly because we don't know
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
where else to send them
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
i've been present for some of these
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
complaints that go before the board of
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
selectmen and even there they pretty
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
much die because you know these these
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
residents are told that
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything about it so it's
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
not a matter of taking away
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
what the voters want in the sense of who
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
they want for
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
their elected animal control officer
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for some type of
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
support that says should this animal
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
control officer not do what the town has
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
voted them to do that someone's going to
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
be there to support them to say okay
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to remove this person or
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
whatever take appropriate action against
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
this person so
 
00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:52.950 align:start position:0%
this person so
um

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to get into any type
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
of personal politics or whatever was
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
insinuated earlier today it's just a
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
matter of holding this position
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
responsible just as with our road agent
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
i mean our town dealt with the same
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
thing with our road agent and our
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
current aco who's on that selectmen was
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
in support of oversight for that
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
position so i find it kind of odd that
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's a picking and choosing of what
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
positions that are elected
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
get oversight and just to touch upon
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
the chief of police that is a that is an
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
elected position as well however all
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
officers in the state of new hampshire
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
are held accountable by police standards
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
and training council so
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
my police chief is not able to just do
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
whatever he wants and
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know he's still held accountable
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
when calls don't get answered by the
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
animal control officer there's nobody to
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
to do anything about that when car calls
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
aren't handled handled appropriately
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's no one to be able to do anything
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
and it's very frustrating for our police
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
department to hear that our residents
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
are so unhappy at times and and we can't
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
do anything about it
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
because they people think that this
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
position falls under the police
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
department and i just want to be clear
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
that it does not this this position is
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
separate this animal control position is
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
a different department than the police
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
department in the town of danville and i
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
know that it seems you know this is only
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
one town in all of the state but it is
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
the only town and i can tell you that it
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
we are heavily affected by this um she's
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
this position is not required to hold
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
any type of police certification um of
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
course they're able to
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
enforce some
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
violation level offenses they're not
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to go as far for misdemeanors to
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
prosecute these things um and i will
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
the person that is holding this position
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
right now sheila johansen
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
i know personally i don't trust her to
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
be part of my criminal investigations
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
because of history that she has shown
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um herself
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
let me let me say that
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
i think that last comment would be
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so i would ask you to uh
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay and i apologize but
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
again that's really where we stand
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
as a police department as far as um
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
looking for someone to do something
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
because we can't we can't do anything to
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
hold this position accountable and it's
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
again it's frustrating we're hearing it
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
from our people of the town so i respect
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
their vote i respect want you know who
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
they choose it's just a matter of being
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
able to hold this position accountable
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
um when things aren't being done the
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
right way
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
let the record show that representative
 
00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:42.630 align:start position:0%
let the record show that representative
piamonte

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
piamonte
 
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.589 align:start position:0%
piamonte
has

00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
just been joined the committee in
 
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.910 align:start position:0%
just been joined the committee in
958

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
958
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have the next question from
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'm not sure
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
who to pose this question to if i would
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
be posing it to um
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
mercedes or um to representative wallace
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
but my question um
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
kind of straight up is based on what ms
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
merced uh commented about that if
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
there were complaints and there were
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
issues and that they could not they
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
currently cannot take any action i guess
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
my question would be what type of action
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
would they want to take short of um
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating an elected position
 
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.950 align:start position:0%
eliminating an elected position
um

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
so i think that's basically what my
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
i asked representative
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
wallace to
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
try to field that question
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative klee for the
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
question uh it is it is my understanding
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
that at present time because there is no
 
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
that at present time because there is no
uh

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
root source of the authority that the
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
animal control officer holds
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
potential for oversight or
 
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:00.930 align:start position:0%
potential for oversight or
um

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:00.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.309 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
supervisory guidance or and or
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
discipline should the
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
conditions warrant and it's as simple as
 
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.030 align:start position:0%
conditions warrant and it's as simple as
that

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.549 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're hoping to get with
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
this uh measure is to at least be able
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
to have the position have some
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm not certain or i'm not privy to
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
all the details of what the nature of
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
the complaints are i don't wish to be
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
all i know is that we're having a
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
problem with this and it's it's already
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
cost the town plenty at this point in
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
time with the lawsuits multiple warrant
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
articles and uh you know and after all
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
that time has passed we get rid of the
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
position so now that court order is now
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
null and void because we did vote to
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
remove the elected acl position and have
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
since subsequently reinstated it so
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
that court order is
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's ancient history at
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
this point of time and has no effect so
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
here we are
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the last
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
question for this bill mr chairman i
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
have a quick follow-up just just a real
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up if that's okay we're
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
well behind schedule so please make it
 
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
well behind schedule so please make it
quick

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
no that's okay i will i will pass up my
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay the next question and last question
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this question is
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
ms merced
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
i guess my question here is
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
since this is an elected position
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
currently same as your town clerk is an
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
elected position
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
i would assume that just as if someone
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
complains about a town clerk
 
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.750 align:start position:0%
complains about a town clerk
then

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
i i'm not quite sure why the animal
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
control officers being an elected
 
00:52:44.319 --> 00:52:45.430 align:start position:0%
control officers being an elected
position

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
is any more difficult for the town than
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the town clerk is an
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
elected position
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
can you unravel that for me please
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
so what i would say to that is um to the
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with any complaints
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
that go through the town clerk's office
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
i probably wouldn't be because it's it's
 
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.870 align:start position:0%
i probably wouldn't be because it's it's
so

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
um different from the police department
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
the reason why i'm aware of these
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
complaints that are coming against the
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
animal control position is because
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
in my opinion based on these complaints
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
residents don't understand that the
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
animal control position is separate so
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
they're coming to the police department
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking for relief and then
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're not able to give them anything
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
what i would say to that is
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
i guess this bill in general and the
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
idea behind this bill came from having a
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
problem um and that's why we're looking
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
for some help on
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
a statute end i don't know of any
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
problem that is arising from the town
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
clerk i'm not saying whether it's
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate inappropriate or whatnot
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's i don't have knowledge of the
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
town clerk what i do know is there is a
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
problem when it comes to the animal
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
control position so because there is a
 
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.190 align:start position:0%
control position so because there is a
problem

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's where this has come from
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
so i i'm not saying that it it's not
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate i have no idea but i know
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with this animal
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
control position and that's why i'm here
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
to speak on that
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
complex issue and we've had a lot of
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
testimony to help us understand so thank
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%

i have one more question represent
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%

lieutenant merced thank you so much for
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
coming today and may i ask why would
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
someone who has a complaint not go
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
directly to the animal control officer
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably because that's who they have
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
the complaint with and if this person is
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
not answering their calls
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
they're looking for a person who's above
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
them just as if someone had a complaint
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%

chief of police
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
because he's the one that's going to be
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
able to do something about that
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%

okay thank you mr chairman um members of
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
the committee hb 439 attempts to amend
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
rsa 47 colon 17 to make it more
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionally appropriate
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
as many of you know new hampshire is not
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
a home rule state there have been three
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
attempts in modern history to amend the
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
constitution to give local authorities
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
more autonomy but all attempts have
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
failed the 1981 case gerard vs
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
allenstown upheld that towns and cities
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
derived their authority from the state
 
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.069 align:start position:0%
derived their authority from the state
legislature

00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
rsa4717 gives a laundry list of powers
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
to local authorities plenty in fact to
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
cover any issues i could foresee but the
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
problem i see specifically is with the
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
line that reads quote they may make any
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
other bylaws and regulations which may
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
seem for the well-being of the city
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
the term well-being is wildly unspecific
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
because of the broadness of the term i
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
do not believe that this could be
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
considered a specific authority granted
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
by the state legislature
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
what exactly qualifies as well-being
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
well in the town of enfield it
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
apparently includes picnicking in a
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
cemetery which is prohibited and let's
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
not forget about the town of newfields
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
which made an ordinance that resulted in
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
a reporter being fined for simply
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
reporting does the well-being of the
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
town include violating freedom of the
 
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
town include violating freedom of the
press

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
press
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
in laconia there is an ordinance that
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes above and beyond the state's
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
indecent exposure law to include a ban
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
of showing a female nipple in public
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
which practically prohibits public
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding i'm unaware of a state
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
statute that gives the local authority
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to prohibit public
 
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
the ability to prohibit public
breastfeeding

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
let's not forget that the proposed
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
curfew in nashua can anyone show proof
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
that curfews have done anything to curb
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
the spread of an infectious disease the
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
answer i can say with certainty is no
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
however does plenty to harm the
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
businesses and the liberty of the people
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i cannot find a statute that gives
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
the city the ability to arbitrarily
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
close all businesses at a certain hour
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
in conclusion the term well-being is far
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
too broad to be considered an authority
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
granted by the legislature
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i suggest striking the line in its
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
entirety from rsa4717
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'm attempting to make this law as
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional as possible if the people
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
of this state wish to be a home rule
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
state we could pass such an amendment
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
but as things stand right now well-being
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
is isn't an enumerated power granted by
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature should a local authority
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
find a need to add to the already
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
extensive list of powers granted by the
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislature i'm sure the legislature
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
would grant this authority but
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
well-being cannot be used as a catch-all
 
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.109 align:start position:0%
well-being cannot be used as a catch-all
phrase

00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%

00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um i am nate grays i'm
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
an attorney and lobbyist with the new
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill
 
00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.589 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill
um

00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:31.599 --> 00:59:32.630 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
phrase any other bylaws and regulations
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
which may seem for the well-being of the
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
city uh has been
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
in existence for
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
quite some time the earliest that i
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
could find any sort of reference to that
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
1846 so this has been a power given to
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
cities for
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
quite a long time now
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a manifestation of what's known
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
as the police power
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.390 align:start position:0%
that is
uh

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
that according to the supreme court
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
gives municipalities the authority to
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
promote such varied interests as public
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
health safety morals comfort
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
and the production of prosperity and the
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
general welfare and that comes from a
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
2019 new hampshire supreme court case
 
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.710 align:start position:0%
2019 new hampshire supreme court case
it's

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important to
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is a power that was
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
granted by the legislature to city
 
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.390 align:start position:0%
granted by the legislature to city
councils

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
councils
 
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.270 align:start position:0%
councils
to

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
make the bylaws that they need to make
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with local issues
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
um it's not
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's not broader than that there have
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
been a number of cases over the last
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
century and a half
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
about this power and how it operates
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it's clear that any
 
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.630 align:start position:0%
and it's clear that any
city

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
city
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
ordinance which would violate the
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
statutes or the new hampshire
 
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.109 align:start position:0%
statutes or the new hampshire
constitution

01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
is not valid the new hampshire supreme
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
court has said that numerous times
 
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.789 align:start position:0%
court has said that numerous times
um

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
but it's this
 
01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.789 align:start position:0%
but it's this
this

01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
is an important line in our say 4717
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
um because the legislature's recognized
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
that they simply can't list every
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
possible scenario that would come up
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
i'm certain that
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
everyone could think of a number of
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
different issues that could come up that
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
that are local that really could be
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with the local level
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and that would be
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
a real headache if every time one of
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
those came up the legislature to deal
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
with it we'd have very long hearings
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
where the legislature would have to
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
mediate between uh local
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
officials and try to determine what the
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate response is
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
it would be more appropriate just to
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
leave the authority as it has been for
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
the last century and a half
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
and allow this to be resolved to the
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
local level
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
also want to note
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
that uh representative lasik
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
um listed some ordinances from from
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
towns as well as cities
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to point out that rc 4717
 
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.069 align:start position:0%
i just want to point out that rc 4717
uh

01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
roman 15 only applies to cities not to
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
town so those ordinances would be
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
enacted under a different statute i'm
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that any
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have questions
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%

for taking my question
um

01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
you pointed out yes it is the local
 
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
you pointed out yes it is the local
control

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.549 align:start position:0%
control
and

01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
this ordinance in terms of changing the
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
public for public safety
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
i mean during a pandemic
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
and how often do we get pandemic so this
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
does this intrude on the local control
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
for the public safety
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
during what we are experiencing right
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
now to take that away
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
and this is my city and i feel safe that
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
we have this
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh ordinance to
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
keep us safe
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
would you allude to that please thank
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
you for the question so i i really can't
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
answer questions about specific
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances which may be uh in front of
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
courts at the moment because
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
part of what we do at nhma is provide
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
legal advice to
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
cities and towns um so
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
i i can't provide any advice that would
 
01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.069 align:start position:0%
i i can't provide any advice that would
be

01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
any ordinances which may be an issue
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
presently in the courts
 
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
presently in the courts
um

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.470 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
you know the police powers
 
01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
you know the police powers
are

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
broad authority that
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
are given to government generally and
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
you know in this case they've been um
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
narrowed down to the local level
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
and really
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
it's important to keep in mind that
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know this this statute has a long
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
history and some of the things that have
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
been addressed have faded into the past
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
you know what we're talking about now
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic you know next year
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
this will be passed um and any sort of
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
issues that have come up as a result of
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
that um can be resolved appropriately
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to worry about that
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
but that's something that we've seen
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
over time that these issues come up um
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
local decisions have to be made
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh for to confront local problems um
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
they're not to the level that the
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to deal with them and
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
once they've dealt with that problem you
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
know time passes issues get resolved and
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay our next question is from
 
01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
okay our next question is from
representative

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you um mr
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
grace for taking this question as an
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
example i'd like to know this
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
and there
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
occurred in a city
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
a situation where a swimming hole
 
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
a situation where a swimming hole
became

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
became
 
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.750 align:start position:0%
became
poisoned

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
poisoned
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
would that it would this enactment
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
prevent the city from saying the
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
populace could not use that swimming
 
01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:25.430 align:start position:0%
populace could not use that swimming
place

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have the entirety of 47 17
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
memorized but i think that's a good
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
example of something that
 
01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:34.710 align:start position:0%
example of something that
wouldn't

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
be necessarily limited here
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be listed under
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
4717 in another
 
01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.310 align:start position:0%
4717 in another
provision

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.710 align:start position:0%
provision
[Music]

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
it would this removal of this power
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be a fundamental change to local
 
01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.630 align:start position:0%
would be a fundamental change to local
government

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it's something the local government
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
would have to come in front of the
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislature and say hey you know the
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
swimming pool is poisoned we need your
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
authority to close it or
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
um you know we have this issue with with
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
these two intersections of these two
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
roads or something that's so small
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
that it just really doesn't make sense
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to take up its time
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
next uh question from representative
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my question
 
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.910 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my question
um

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
i just curious uh
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
where does it start
 
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.829 align:start position:0%
where does it start
um

01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
the legislation can be convened in 10
 
01:06:35.839 --> 01:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
the legislation can be convened in 10
days

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
to roll on any any uh
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
problems and issues that come up
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
um within that ten day period
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
and some cities went beyond
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's emergency order
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
again i can't give an opinion as to any
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
any ordinances which may now be pending
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
before the courts um what i will say is
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
this new hampshire supreme court has
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
been very clear on
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
in a number of cases
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
where they've said
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
where they looked at
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
local ordinances and
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
they've said you know it's clear in the
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
statute and the statute
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
spells out
 
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.829 align:start position:0%
spells out
that

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
any ordinance which
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
goes against state law or the state
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
constitution wouldn't be valid
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
um these are really case-by-case basis
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible to answer that
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
our next speaker
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be representative testerman
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
i have a karen testerman which may be
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
also representative testerman and should
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did i did i promote you
 
01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.190 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did i did i promote you
incorrectly

01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
you did i am a city counselor in the
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
city of franklin my name is karen
 
01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
city of franklin my name is karen
testerman

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
testerman
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i happen to be married to
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative testerman so that may be
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
where the confusion is
 
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.789 align:start position:0%
where the confusion is
um

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for allowing me to
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
speak on this on behalf of this bill
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
i want to commend the um proponents of
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
this bill because they are trying to
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
abiding by the constitution
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
in all of our legislation and going in
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
and actually finding areas in our
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
current legislation
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
there are minor
 
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
there are minor
um

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
changes that should be made that now uh
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
align us more in line with what it was
 
01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
align us more in line with what it was
intended

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
in earlier in
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
last year i guess it was
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
in bert versus shirtless the supreme
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
court came back the u.s or the new
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court came in and said
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
that indeed no branch of state
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
government can lawfully perform any act
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
which violates the state constitution
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
and in
 
01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:14.309 align:start position:0%
and in
fact

01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
removing the ambiguous language that
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
grants city councils the authority to
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
make laws and or ordinances that may
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
seem to be for the well-being of the
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
city is an appropriate uh sentence to
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
strike out and uh that's why i'm in
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
support of it in fact in my opinion
 
01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.309 align:start position:0%
support of it in fact in my opinion
the

01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
the
language

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.269 align:start position:0%
language
in

01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
4717 should all be struck except for the
 
01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:42.950 align:start position:0%
4717 should all be struck except for the
last

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
sentence to make it simple because
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
laws are supposed to be written so that
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
the common person can understand them
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and going through all the legalese
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
before you get to the actual sentence is
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
very confusing to uh the common man and
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
so therefore i think that that it which
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to amend this law
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
by striking everything except for the
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
last sentence that says no bylaw or
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
ordinance shall be repugnant to the
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
constitution of the laws of the state
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
and by and such bylaws and ordinances
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
shall take effect and be enforced from
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
the time they're in limited without the
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
sanction or confirmation of any other
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
authority whatever
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
asked that you would uh pass this bill
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
as ought to pass and i'd be happy to
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions i have also emailed
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh the committee
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
my statement
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh doing that email that makes it much
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
easier for us to create the uh
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
the build file so at this point i'm
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
gonna ask if there are are there any
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
members of the of the committee that
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
have questions for council person
 
01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
have questions for council person
testimony

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes that's our representative
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so uh
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
councilman testament karen do you know
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
slack sentence seems to hit john the
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
question the single definition of
 
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
question the single definition of
well-being

01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
do you know what rsa what that defines
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
the word well-being and what that means
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh i do not and i and therefore i think
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that there are times when
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
yes there are individual situations but
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is uh something that i think that
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
we have the ability
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
as elected persons to be able to address
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
putting it into the law books
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
follow yes go ahead
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
so it was roger the cdc defines
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
well-being as there's no consensus
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
around a single definition of well-being
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
but the general agreement that at a
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
minimum well-being includes the presence
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
of positive emotions and moods
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh contentedness happiness the absence
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
of negative emotions does that sound
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
something that a city should try to
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
govern through
 
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
govern through
ordinance

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.630 align:start position:0%
ordinance
no

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um next i'm sorry we have a
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
question from committee member
 
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.310 align:start position:0%
question from committee member
representative

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
i guess this is a question for um
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
councilwoman testerman
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
in rsa 4717
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
the um the law
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
governs the sale or barter of junk
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
if i have an issue with the way the word
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
junk is defined
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
how does this law help me
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
and why
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
are you not proposing to change that
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
piece of subjectivity
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the one that you have
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
proposed changing
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
if you will um
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry was that in another section
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually in the same section
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
it is hold on just a second it's line
 
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.910 align:start position:0%
it is hold on just a second it's line
13.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh wait a second i don't have the
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislation right in front of me well
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
let me read it to you
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
amongst the things that cities can
 
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.430 align:start position:0%
amongst the things that cities can
regulate

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
butchers petty grocers hucksters
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
peddlers hawkers and common viddlers
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
dealers in and keepers of shops for the
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
purchase sale or barto of junk
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on from there
 
01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:28.950 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on from there
and

01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
question and that is why i suggested
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
that all of the language prior to the
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
last sentence in that
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
law be struck i think it would be
 
01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.470 align:start position:0%
law be struck i think it would be
well

01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
a good measure of the um
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee to go ahead and amend this
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
bill and strike out everything
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
beforehand simply because
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
people have put whoever put this bill
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
together in the or this language
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
together in the first place was trying
 
01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
together in the first place was trying
to

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
imagine all the possibilities and
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know somebody else can come by
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
and have
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
another idea that is not listed in there
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
for or in con conflict with it and
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
therefore you're you're
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
causing conflict that should be
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
addressed on an uh
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
issue by issue situation
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
up mr chair please yes please go ahead
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
then then why do we not have that
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
amended bill before us
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
why why are we only looking at this one
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
line if if in your uh judgment it would
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
be preferable to strike everything prior
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
to that line why is that we're just
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
considering this today
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
i uh thank you for the question but i
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
did not write the uh um the lsr or

as it is in committee
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
to adjust it and i don't know what the
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%

question although i think my question
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony may be best
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
for nate graves from nhma
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm reading article 1 of the
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
and it says all men are born equally
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
free and independent therefore all
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
government of rights originates from the
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
people is founded in consent and
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
instituted for
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
the general good
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh i do not believe so but i do think
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for your
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
question i do believe that
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
according to our constitution
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
that law should not be made except by
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
the approval of the people
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
it is the consent of the govern that
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
should be allowed and in fact if you
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
really go through the constitution it
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
says the general court should only
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh be meeting
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the state or the
 
01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.270 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the state or the
citizens

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
and so that does not mean that you
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
should be meeting every six months
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
for a full time to be introducing a lot
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
mitigate as citizens
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%

it is vitally important
 
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
that cities have the ability to

01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
we who represent the citizens of our
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
city are all what cities are always
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
mindful that such regulations must be in
 
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.830 align:start position:0%
mindful that such regulations must be in
conformance

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
conformance
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
with our state constitution laws
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
eliminating our discretionary ability to
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
rapidly enact ordinances which we deem
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of our
 
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.470 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of our
citizens

01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
is both unnecessary
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
and unwise
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
in closing on behalf of the city of
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
lebanon and the other 11 signatories to
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
our letter
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
i respectfully request that the
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
committee find
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
h hb 439 as an expedient to legislate
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mayor i have a question
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um mr chairman and
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mayor mcnamara for taking
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
um i will be honest with you i'm an
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
alderman also in uh in the city of
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
nashua um
 
01:22:06.719 --> 01:22:07.750 align:start position:0%
nashua um
and

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
the when the curfew
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
law came up or the request we defeated
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
it very handily but um putting that
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
aside if we were to pass something like
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that and um
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
and and i assume you you have the same
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
issue in your city would the courts not
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
um have the right to uh step in either
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
through a um independent um
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
citizen or even a legislator to come in
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
and to sue the city have you experienced
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not a lawyer or legal
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
expert but i'm very confident that the
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
courts would have the ability to step in
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for taking my
 
01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.229 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for taking my
question

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we have a question
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
another question from
 
01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.470 align:start position:0%
another question from
foodie

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
foodie
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr s
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh mayor mcnamara for taking my question
 
01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:04.830 align:start position:0%
uh mayor mcnamara for taking my question
um

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
if this bill was uh in uh
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
law right now
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
how would it hamper
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
mayors like you in the different cities
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't catch the end of your
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
you said how would it hamper us in and i
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
didn't catch the end of it yeah how
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
would it have hampered you to uh
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
as a mayor to
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
enact or
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
safeguard the safety of the citizens
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
well i'll give you a specific example um
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
relating to the pandemic so
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
we had not considered a mass coordinates
 
01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
we had not considered a mass coordinates
and

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
we were reached out to um by
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
at least one prominent local small
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
business owner
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
who said that they were having a lot of
 
01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.629 align:start position:0%
who said that they were having a lot of
trouble

01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh with voluntary compliance with a mask
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
order that that they had enacted for
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
their business
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
and that they felt that it was not being
 
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.830 align:start position:0%
and that they felt that it was not being
um

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
uniformly um
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
administered over the entire city so we
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
were able to act very rapidly
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and enact what we felt was a very
 
01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
and enact what we felt was a very
reasonable

01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh mass coordinates which is still in
 
01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh mass coordinates which is still in
effect

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
we had only minimal
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
negative feedback to that i think it has
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
been very positive
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
in keeping the incidence of covert 19
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
down in the city of lebanon
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
i have my doubts that we would have been
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
quickly if we had to do it through the
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
legislature and get it into
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
into the rsas so
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
it would hamper us
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh in what we call emerging situations
 
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh in what we call emerging situations
now

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
these are not ordinances that last
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
forever they are ordinances that last
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the period of time that we deem them
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
to be necessary
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we certainly try not to have more
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances on the books than we need so
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
next question is
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.629 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh mayor uh
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
give us an example of what the timeline
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
and procedure would be like
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
if in fact this ordinance
 
01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
if in fact this ordinance
this

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
this
bill

01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
passed through the legislature and the
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
governor signed it what would be the
 
01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.470 align:start position:0%
governor signed it what would be the
procedure

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
for adding an ordinance
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
at the city level
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
well i would imagine that we would need
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
to get one of our you're talking about
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
if we required state action to be able
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
to enact an ordinance
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
yes if you needed state action in order
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
to pass an ordinance certainly so
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
we would go through one or more of our
 
01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:04.550 align:start position:0%
we would go through one or more of our
representatives

01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
we would ask that representative to
 
01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:08.470 align:start position:0%
we would ask that representative to
prepare

01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
a bill for passage
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
they would need to take it before
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
presumably this committee
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
if it was deemed expedient to legislate
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
then through
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives and so i
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
could envision certainly several months
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
from the time we
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
came up with the idea for an ordinance
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
question is from representative tripp
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.189 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
if this was to be removed from the law
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
what would the effect
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
be on
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances are existing already would
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
they suddenly become uh
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and i and i
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer to it because i
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if it would cause all
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
existing ordinances
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
with uh with other than the ones that
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
are currently listed there
 
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.590 align:start position:0%
are currently listed there
to

01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
be invalid i don't know it might our
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance might disappear our
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
sewer ordinance might disappear i don't
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%

01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you mayor
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
um for taking my question
 
01:27:36.239 --> 01:27:37.750 align:start position:0%
um for taking my question
um

01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm listening to all this i live in a
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
town it's a little different than a city
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
but i know that this committee has had
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
to listen to a lot of bills to solve
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
problems for an individual community in
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
fact we just listened to one this
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
morning that took an hour
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
in your opinion if you needed to get
 
01:27:55.679 --> 01:27:57.189 align:start position:0%
in your opinion if you needed to get
authority

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the legislature before you passed a
 
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
from the legislature before you passed a
local

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
ordinance to deal with a local specific
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
problem that's happening
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
would you see a lot of laws being
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
enacted do you think that our
 
01:28:08.719 --> 01:28:10.950 align:start position:0%
enacted do you think that our
one-size-fit-all

01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
one-size-fit-all
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
laws for all the states cities um yes i
 
01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:15.910 align:start position:0%
laws for all the states cities um yes i
do

01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes i do we all have our own individual
 
01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.030 align:start position:0%
yes i do we all have our own individual
problems

01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
we certainly have a lot of common
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
problems but there are things that come
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
up in one municipality that may not come
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
up in another and i do see a lot of
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
potential for a lot of one-size-fits-all
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
um bills and a very exhaustive list by
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
the time you
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
took care of everything that need to be
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah questions from
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
the committee from
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative theomonte
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
being at dylan will state
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic as an example but outside of
 
01:28:56.639 --> 01:28:58.629 align:start position:0%
pandemic as an example but outside of
that

01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
would this apply to anything you wanted
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill is getting at
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
can you respond to that
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly try i mean
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
i think that there is a possibility
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
a municipality
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
could come up with an ordinance i would
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
hope we did not do it in lebanon but
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
someone might
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
that in fact was repugnant to the new
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution the laws of the
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
state in that case there is a
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
legal remedy
 
01:29:33.679 --> 01:29:34.629 align:start position:0%
legal remedy
to

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
overturn that ordinance so i think the
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
remedies are there to fix a problem if a
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
problem occurs
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh i am
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
doubtful that this will happen that that
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh next question is from
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:54.950 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
so

01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is a follow-up to representative
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
porter's question so
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
if we do see an increase in
 
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.030 align:start position:0%
if we do see an increase in
one-size-fits-all

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
legislation for
 
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.110 align:start position:0%
legislation for
um

01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
relating to local issues for
 
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.270 align:start position:0%
relating to local issues for
municipalities

01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
which committee
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
would you foresee those coming before
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
like would it be this one the municipal
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
and county government committee in other
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
words are we going to be creating a lot
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
more work for ourselves by
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that you folks would be
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
the first stop and i would see the
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
potential for a lot of discussions
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
similar to the one you just had on hp i
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
think was 431
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
which was very very specific and i could
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
see that happening dozens of times
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
over the course of a year
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think our last
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%

association here in new hampshire and i
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
want to thank you
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to comment in
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 439
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
for many of the reasons that you've
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
already heard so i'll try to be brief on
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
why the american heart association is
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
here today is we do advocate for public
 
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.229 align:start position:0%
here today is we do advocate for public
policies

01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
both at the state level community level
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
federal level to create environments
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
where people can easily make healthy
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
choices including active lifestyles
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
access to nutritious foods and living
 
01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.510 align:start position:0%
access to nutritious foods and living
tobacco-free

01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco-free
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
we want everyone to benefit from smart
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
and effective policies that promote
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety as well as civic
 
01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.350 align:start position:0%
health and safety as well as civic
engagement

01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to see is for states
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
to block local governments from passing
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
laws that make sense to
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
it can hurt people where the need is
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
greatest limiting local decision making
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
usually leaves communities stuck in that
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all rule that doesn't
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
always make sense for every community
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
local governments are uniquely
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
positioned to meet the needs of the
 
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.350 align:start position:0%
positioned to meet the needs of the
people

01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
in their communities they are more
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
connected to residents and more
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
accountable to them
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
local residents and local leaders want
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
what's best for their communities they
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
know how to solve local problems because
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
they see them up close
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
and when local communities come up with
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
a solution to their challenges and put
 
01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:35.430 align:start position:0%
a solution to their challenges and put
them

01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
together come together to put them in
 
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.390 align:start position:0%
together come together to put them in
practice

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
state government should be there to help
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
them improve those and not necessarily
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
strike them down
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
i won't go into a lot of description
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
because this is in my written testimony
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
but one example that came to mind when i
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
saw this bill is the impact that it
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
could have on local policies
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
which are designed
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
designed roadways that are safe for all
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
users so there's several communities in
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that have what's called
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
complete streets or walkable communities
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
and these are roadways that have
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
features and designs that the local
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
communities do
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
to make them safer
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
for both pedestrians and for even
 
01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.629 align:start position:0%
for both pedestrians and for even
motorists

01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
motorists
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
and it also is is something that can
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
also benefit businesses by bringing foot
 
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
also benefit businesses by bringing foot
traffic

01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
to those local businesses so in
 
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
to those local businesses so in
conclusion

01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote in expedient to
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
legislate in house bill 49
 
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.229 align:start position:0%
legislate in house bill 49
439

01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
439
 
01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.030 align:start position:0%
439
that

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
states should build
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
the foundation for local communities
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
and basic protections so everyone's
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
treated fairly local government should
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
then have the ability to strengthen
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
those protections based upon what they
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
know about their communities
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
and it's much more effective when state
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
and local governments can coordinate and
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
work in solidarity to localize build
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
upon and strengthen minimum state
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
standards to meet those unique needs of
 
01:33:58.239 --> 01:33:59.910 align:start position:0%
standards to meet those unique needs of
communities

01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
so again i did submit written testimony
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i really really hope that
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
we can work together on
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
meaningful and effective policies
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%

some cities and towns have gone above
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
and beyond the governor's executive
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
orders based on perhaps party
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
affiliation emotion and maybe not even
 
01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.910 align:start position:0%
affiliation emotion and maybe not even
facts

01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
facts
 
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.830 align:start position:0%
facts
for

01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
example one of the things that my town
 
01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.229 align:start position:0%
example one of the things that my town
did

01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:35:58.239 --> 01:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
did
was

01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
do an ordinance that passed
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
um that would require the people of the
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
town to wear a mask coming into town
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
hall but did not require
 
01:36:12.149 --> 01:36:12.159 align:start position:0%
people who worked inside town hall to
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
wear a mask i was the sole dissenting
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
vote against that
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
as the member from sandown alluded to
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
when does this stop
 
01:36:25.110 --> 01:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
what this build does is change the line
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
what this build does is change the line
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
for quote
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the well-being
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
unquote which appears and can be
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
transcribed as a catch-all of authority
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
for local authorities to do as they wish
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
let's take the town of newfields for
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
example as the member from merrimack who
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor on this bill
 
01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor on this bill
mentioned

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
this helped allow a town to pass an
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional mandate from peaceful
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
protesting whether you agree where the
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
protesting took place or not
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
it further
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
it took it further excuse me and ended
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
up finding a reporter
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
and was a direct attack on the first
 
01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
and was a direct attack on the first
amendment

01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
that this concludes my testimony i asked
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
the committee to pass this bill otp so
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
be a technology limitation

initially stated so
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
um very quickly the gorham board of
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
selectmen is respectfully requesting
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they be given the authority to
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
appoint the town clerk tax collector
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
currently we have one person filling
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
both positions along with a deputy the
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
position is currently staffed by a
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
full-time person who's been with us for
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
10 plus years and a deputy is the former
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
full-time clerk tax collector who was
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
with the town for more than 35 years
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
our full-time town clerk is expected to
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
retire within the next couple of years
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
but may do so sooner and our deputy
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
wishes to retire within a few months
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
the full-time position pays over fifty
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars with benefits there is
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
no one that we know of in gorham who is
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
qualified and is willing to be elected
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the position we do know of at least a
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
couple of financially skilled people who
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
would take the position if they were to
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
be appointed ingorum the town clerk tax
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
collector is responsible for collecting
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
just over four million dollars in
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
revenues including over six hundred and
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
forty thousand in motor vehicle
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
registrations the town recently updated
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
its software that provides for the
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
assessment data to be exported to a
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
collect pro system which then generates
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
the property tax bills this system is
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
very complicated and takes quite some
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
time to master
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
for someone who is not very good at
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
computer programs to attempt this would
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
be disastrous
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk's side of the position keeps
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
the registered roles and election
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
documents in the same office as the tax
 
01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
documents in the same office as the tax
collector

01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
collector
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
the town long ago determined that the
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
only way to get someone to competently
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
manage both roles was to make a combined
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
position and to compensate that person
 
01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.270 align:start position:0%
position and to compensate that person
accordingly

01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
we fear a situation where we are
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to hand over these
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
duties to someone who is unqualified but
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
has been elected based on their
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
popularity or because the position is
 
01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:27.590 align:start position:0%
popularity or because the position is
uncontested

01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
uncontested
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
the board wishes to appoint a qualified
 
01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
applicant that has the relevant
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
background financial training and the
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
required skills and experience necessary
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
to adequately perform the duties of the
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
town clerk tax collector decision
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
we feel that this position is of vital
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
importance and that it should be filled
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
with the most skilled and experienced
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%

01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
but that they were qualified people who
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
might serve
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
if they were appointed can you explain
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
that a little bit further to me this
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
people you know who could do the job but
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want to put their name on the
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
ballot is that what you're saying
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
i am saying that um they they would like
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be appointed so that they are assured
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the position is theirs um longer
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
than just a two-year term
 
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.750 align:start position:0%
than just a two-year term
um

01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.109 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.510 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
um current town clerk does not mind the
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
fact that she is appointed she's been
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
here for 10 years and she's fine with
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
that but we are really worried about a
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
person running that does not have the
 
01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.669 align:start position:0%
person running that does not have the
financial

01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
skills and background that would just
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
win this
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know win an elected position
 
01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:53.830 align:start position:0%
you know win an elected position
um

01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
just based on the fact that they want to
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know give it a try and they don't
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
really have the skills to do it and it's
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
a very important
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
vital position to the town you're
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of money and we don't
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
want that to happen
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up mr chair yeah
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
and so and so that
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know usually in a situation like
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
that where there's someone who doesn't
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
have the background there's a deputy
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
that works with them that actually is
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
the one that coaches the clerk and makes
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
sure that everything is
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
the way it should be but you said your
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
deputy is also retiring
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct she actually wanted to
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
retire last december and has stayed on
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
so if the could you do you appoint your
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
deputies or do they get elected
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
the deputy is appointed
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're welcome next question is from
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative magic booty
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chase thank you miss uh
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
well for taking my question so changing
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
this to
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
appointed position would this help with
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
frequent turnover
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
of election every two years especially
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
performing an important task as stack
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
collection which is the revenue
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
for the town would this help
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
make a stability
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
and continuity
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
i do feel that this would make a big
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
difference as far as having someone in
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
the position for a long longer amount of
 
01:47:58.719 --> 01:48:04.470 align:start position:0%
the position for a long longer amount of
time

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh

and the next question is from
representative

01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
lobby here
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't know if i caught it
 
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
correctly but you said you have a person
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
in town that's afraid to go on the
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
ballot that's qualified
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
that true
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes and i i wouldn't say that she's
 
01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
afraid i would say that she wants to
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
have the position if it's an appointed
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
position she does not want to
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
um have to run for election and then
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
worry about running every two years
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.109 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
question of stability came up
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
on this have you had any problem in the
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
past with stability i i thought i heard
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
you had
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
a president that's been there for years
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh we are worried um about stability in
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
the event that someone runs that does
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
not have the qualifications needed to do
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
this position and that's where the
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
instability would come in
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%

town clerk tax collector
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
i was first elected in march 2018 and
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm up for re-election this year
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
prior to being elected counselor i
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
served as the deputy town clerk tax
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
collector for almost 11 years
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
i have spent over a decade
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
working for an office that directly
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
serves the voters and the public
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
i've eminently opposed hb 463 which
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
seeks to turn the gorham town clerk tax
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
collector's office from an elected
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
position to an appointed position
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
i ask that everyone here oppose this
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill this is a bad bill and i'll explain
 
01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.270 align:start position:0%
bill this is a bad bill and i'll explain
why

01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the town clerk is a local election
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
official that administers town state and
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
federal elections within their
 
01:51:16.239 --> 01:51:17.750 align:start position:0%
federal elections within their
communities

01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
this fact alone is reason enough to
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
always keep the clerk an elected
 
01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.189 align:start position:0%
always keep the clerk an elected
position

01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
an elected official such as the clerk
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
can never be perceived by the voters and
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
that they serve as being influenced by
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
any board any committee or any agenda
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
purity of elections and faith in the
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
process is integral for democracy
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
the community sees the clerk as part of
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
this democratic process
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
the clerk is someone voters and
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
residents are comfortable talking with
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the board of selectmen
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
clerks provide a neutral space for
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
residents and voters to conduct their
 
01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.589 align:start position:0%
residents and voters to conduct their
transactions

01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
if the clerk is placed under the board's
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
direct supervision that neutrality and
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
autonomy is gone
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
that public trust is not as strong
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
the perception of the clerk serving the
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
public first and foremost is replaced
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
with the notion that the clerk serves
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
the board of selectmen's mission
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the public second
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
the quality of service is diminished
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk serves the public faithfully
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
and impartially the role of the clerk is
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
to be autonomous and accountable to the
 
01:52:33.199 --> 01:52:34.149 align:start position:0%
to be autonomous and accountable to the
public

01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
the funda this fundamental principle
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
allows the clerk to perform their duties
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
with integrity and transparency
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
the clerk is not an arm of the board of
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
selectmen or the governing body they are
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
a stand alone elected leader in the
 
01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.669 align:start position:0%
a stand alone elected leader in the
community

01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
they do not work for the border
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
selectmen rather they work with the
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen and vice versa
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
a clerk does not work for a town manager
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
or a town administrator
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
rather they work with them to meet the
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
town's needs
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
an elected clerk is more service
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
oriented as they directly serve the
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
public doing transactions
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
the more the board of selectmen's role
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
in the day-to-day transactions is a
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
and a potential violation of state and
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
federal privacy laws
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
they have no business supervising them
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they have no good reason to be privy
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the transactions they conduct
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
those who support appointing a town
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
clerk argue that they can hire a more
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
qualified person for the job
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
this simply is not true and a weak
 
01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
this simply is not true and a weak
argument

01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
argument
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
the truth is there is no college degree
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
to become a town clerk
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
to become a clerk you must learn from
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
other clerks
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
and state agencies and clerks
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
associations that you work with peery
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
you don't learn to be a clerk from the
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
select board when a new clerk is elected
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
they attend clerk trainings and network
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
with other clerks
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire city and town clerks
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
association offers training and a
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
certification program
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
those who support appointing a clerk
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that it makes the position less
 
01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.149 align:start position:0%
suggest that it makes the position less
about

01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
makes it less about a popularity contest
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
and more about the qualifications
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is not the case a person who runs
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
for clerk is someone who accepts public
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
life and is willingly choosing to serve
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
their positions through the electoral
 
01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:46.629 align:start position:0%
their positions through the electoral
process

01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a popularity contest it's an
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
election process
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
when you remove an elected position
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
you are removing the opportunity for the
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
community to vote who they want
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
you are literally taking
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
away a vote from the people
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a strong history of
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
amazing clerks it is a tight-knit group
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
we stick together and we learn from each
 
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
other if clerks became appointed they
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
may not be as respected from their clerk
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues who value the democratic
 
01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
colleagues who value the democratic
process

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
people have actually said to me that
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
they feel bad that i have to re-run for
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
office every three years
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
while i'm flattered that they're
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
concerned for my future i also recognize
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be an awareness
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
raising in new hampshire that clerks are
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
not like other departments or other
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
elected officials we are a unique hybrid
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
most of what we do is based in statute
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
as process related and is fundamentally
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
rooted in the democratic
 
01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.629 align:start position:0%
rooted in the democratic
process

01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
there really is nothing that the board
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
needs to supervise
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
if a board is worried that nobody will
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
run for clerk they shouldn't because
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
there will always be someone to step up
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
to the plate
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
a point of clarification there are some
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
positions within municipal government
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
that may be better suited as an
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
appointed position
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are valid arguments that support
 
01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
this however this does not apply to the
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
clerk the clerk position is an entirely
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
different animal
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
a special hybrid of statutory roles and
 
01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:24.950 align:start position:0%
a special hybrid of statutory roles and
duties

01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
duties
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
some terms towns have a separate town
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
clerk and a separate tax collector's
 
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.149 align:start position:0%
clerk and a separate tax collector's
office

01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
there are provisions under the law to
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
allow tax collectors to be appointed
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
some towns have combined the two
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
positions making the town clerk tax
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
director's office one office this is
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
common in many towns
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
in combined offices the town clerk is
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
both the town clerk and the tax
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
collector and it has to be an elected
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
office because of the town clerk's
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
duties and responsibilities
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
there are so many reasons why this is a
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
bad bill i did reach out to the clerk in
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
gorham and she opposes this bill
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is not the direction we want new
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire to go in
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
the clerk is a stand-alone leader within
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
a community for a good reason
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
separation of duties safeguards against
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
abuse of power and provides balance
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
while maintaining a positive public
 
01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.070 align:start position:0%
while maintaining a positive public
perception

01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
perception
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue this is a
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue of the local
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
democratic process
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
james madison known as the father of the
 
01:57:27.599 --> 01:57:28.950 align:start position:0%
james madison known as the father of the
constitution

01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
is famously quoted as saying
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
if men were angels no government would
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
be necessary end quote but men are not
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
angels and thus political powers even at
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal level
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
must be separated and balanced
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.229 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
question

01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:02.239 --> 01:58:04.149 align:start position:0%
question
uh

01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually there's
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
several questions but i can maybe just
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh sum it up
 
01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.310 align:start position:0%
uh sum it up
uh

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
it appears that uh
 
01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:15.750 align:start position:0%
it appears that uh
uh

01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
the clerk tax collectivisation is common
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
it appears that the
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
selectmen are concerned
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
tax collector
 
01:58:34.159 --> 01:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
tax collector
uh

01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
position being filled by
 
01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.189 align:start position:0%
position being filled by
someone's

01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
skill is necessary
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
but it also appears
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
in gorham
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk isn't actually doing the tax
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
collective duties he has uh
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
he or she has an assistant
 
01:58:54.159 --> 01:58:55.189 align:start position:0%
he or she has an assistant
so

01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
parent why
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk has to
 
01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.350 align:start position:0%
the clerk has to
be

01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.709 align:start position:0%
be
appointed

01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
when they're not doing the tax
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
collective duties
 
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
the town clerk tax collector is one
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
position in gorham
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%

that that we interact this office
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
interacts with clerks in two main areas
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
elections and in vital records
 
02:01:15.199 --> 02:01:15.990 align:start position:0%
elections and in vital records
uh

02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
elections uh is in new hampshire is
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
built on checks and balances through the
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
entire process and the elections
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
whether they're local state or federal
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
are conducted at the local level
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
and the clerks
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
along with moderators and supervisors of
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
the checklist are very integral to that
 
02:01:35.199 --> 02:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
the checklist are very integral to that
process

02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it is critically important that they
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
maintain entertainment in that process
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to answer to
 
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to answer to
somebody

02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
may potentially try and impact decisions
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
that they make in a critical role of
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that our elections are free
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
and fair and full of integrity
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i would simply echo clerk robert's
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
comments in that respect
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
vital records is also another area
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
where we deal with the clerks clerks are
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
tasked with maintaining
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
the privacy of citizens in your town in
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
terms of data that they have to report
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
related to
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
births deaths marriages divorces
 
02:02:18.159 --> 02:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
births deaths marriages divorces
divorces

02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
divorces
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
adoptions and they have access to all of
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
under law excuse me they have to keep
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
private and confidential
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
they should not be placed in a situation
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
where somebody that that has their thumb
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
on them through some supervisory uh
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
role um
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know can can manipulate that
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
person and uh so obviously
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's an area of concern that we have
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
and then the final thing that i would
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
like to say just to
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
reinforce what clerk robert said
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
was that the clerks have an incredible
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
training and certification process it is
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
very involved i would equate it with
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
taking graduate courses uh
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know at college uh they are very
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
committed to that uh you know we
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
participate in those as instructors
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that the clerks
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
without exception in new hampshire take
 
02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.430 align:start position:0%
without exception in new hampshire take
that

02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
process and their role very seriously
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
so i would
just

02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
start off where i began and say that we
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation and i would be
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr scanlon i believe uh
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%

02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
independent entities but they have to
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
work together as a team they all have
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%

you know it is uh it's a well-oiled
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
machine in new hampshire
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
if in almost every instance
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%

well together
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
and that's borne out by the fact that
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%

02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
a question from uh representative plea
 
02:06:40.639 --> 02:06:43.109 align:start position:0%
a question from uh representative plea
here

02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and um thank you
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh mr scanlon
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh mike my question to you is
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
on a city level the city clerks
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
do i believe all of those duties that
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
you had said maybe there was something
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.119 --> 02:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
why

02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
why does it work okay in the city and
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
not in the towns and i know government
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
is completely different from one to the
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
other but um they have the same
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of of bringing the
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
ballots etc to
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
to making sure that the checklist is
 
02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.310 align:start position:0%
to making sure that the checklist is
done

02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact i know that you
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
stole our previous city clerk
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
to work within your organization and we
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
miss her dearly but we do love our
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
current one um here in nashua
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
um can you explain why
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's not as an issue for our city
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
clerk to not be elected versus a town
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%

02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%

02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
the city clerk is the chief election
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%

02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
elections that are held in the city
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
whether they're local state or federal
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
however every city has a ward or wards
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%

in the ward under the statutes
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
there is no distinction really that is
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
made between
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
a town
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
or a city ward in terms of how the
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%

okay i will um
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
so basically what you're saying is that
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
the difference is the elections but the
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
other duties that were described as far

02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
by our city clerk without an elected
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
official is that correct or i'm mistaken
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
oh you're correct and and the clerk has
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
many responsibilities to go well beyond
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
elections and and vital records
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh you know obviously they you know
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
they deal with voter motor vehicle
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
registrations dog licenses
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
um those are areas the secretary of
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
state does not get involved in but the
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
clerk does have those responsibilities
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i want to move now on to our
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
last speaker uh mr daniel bailey please
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
identify yourself where you're from and
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
daniel healey i'm the derry town clerk
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm representing the new hampshire
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
clerks association and our association
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this bill
 
02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
um we're opposed for the reasons that
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
clerk roberts mentioned everything that
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
she said in her testimony is exactly how
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
her association feels
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
um representative tripp brought up a
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
comment on the combined office
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
a town can vote to split the office of
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
town clerk and tax collector after they
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
have voted to combine it
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
so if gorham believes that they're going
 
02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
to have an issue down the line with
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
their tax collector
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
not being trained well enough they can
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
off of each other if they feel that's
 
02:10:18.639 --> 02:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
off of each other if they feel that's
necessary

02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
um our association does provide a lot of
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
training we have a three-year
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
certification program
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
um that most new clerks attend i
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
attended it my first year i graduated in
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the third year
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
i started um five years ago with no
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
experience as town clerk no prior
 
02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
experience as town clerk no prior
experience

02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
and through the association through
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
reaching out to other clerks i learned
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
the position
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't really believe it's a good
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
excuse to make this an appointed
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
position because they don't feel that
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
someone will step up that someone is is
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
there able to do the job they would be
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
able to find someone
 
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
to do the job and to fill the the role
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
as town clerk
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest to them if they
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
if they feel that the tax collector
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
portion of it
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
a resident's not going to be able to do
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
they can split that off
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
and that's what they should do
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
our association
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
does not like this bill we we oppose
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
this bill and i'm open to any questions
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%

chair
uh

02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
that gorilla should not be have any fear
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
in if we do uh
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
 
02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.950 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
uh

02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that seems what they the
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh the bill is to for a specific town i
 
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
uh the bill is to for a specific town i
know

02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
really is
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
if the selectmen in the town
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
have a concern as to who would be at
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
least a candidate
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
they can't they make sure that the town
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
clerk tax collector
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh retires in between the elections they
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
would appoint somebody
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
let them get real good training and then
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
that person run so couldn't the
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
selectmen have some input to that
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
position if it has to be
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
appointed in between in between the
 
02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
appointed in between in between the
elections

02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
so they would um
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
the person appointed would be appointed
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
to the next annual election um so it
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
would be less than a year appointment
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
but if if they did it right after a town
 
02:12:39.599 --> 02:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
but if if they did it right after a town
election

02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
the person would be in office for about
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
a year before the following election
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
would take place
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
i know in my town that's what we did and
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
it worked out good the person uh got
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
trained and she ran and is still running
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
and the three asking for a three-year
 
02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
and the three asking for a three-year
term

02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh is not too much there's no guarantee
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
but that's what the job offers and i
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
don't think you can change that
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes and our association
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
is very helpful with new clerks they
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
have a new clerk workshop they reach out
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
they make sure to reach out to all the
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
new clerks let them know
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
what help is available
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
a clerk that's been doing the job for a
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
while will even go to that town and sit
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
there with the clerk and assist them and
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that they know what they're
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
doing so we do have the resources as an
 
02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:31.189 align:start position:0%
doing so we do have the resources as an
association

02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
new clerks so i don't really see this as
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
and it's really not an issue yet for
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
gorham they're kind of looking down the
 
02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:42.069 align:start position:0%
gorham they're kind of looking down the
road

02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
road
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
but i mean the towns
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
are going to lose their clerks to
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
retirement it's been it happened in the
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
past where they take other jobs either
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%

02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
go back to 463 however let me report
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
that of those interested
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill we have three in support and
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
is a bill relative to current use tax
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
rate eligibility
 
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.030 align:start position:0%

and

02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
let me ask if uh
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
if we have carrick guitar
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's pronouncing that name
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
directly from the new hampshire wildlife
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
federation who opposes the bill would
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
like to
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
speak mr chair i apologize for

sponsor is on the line to introduce the
 
02:16:10.159 --> 02:16:11.109 align:start position:0%
sponsor is on the line to introduce the
bill

02:16:11.109 --> 02:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%

name is ellen reed i do represent
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
rockingham 17 which are the towns of
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
newmarket and new fields i also have a
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
biology degree from vanderbilt
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
university i have another legislator as
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
well who would like to speak on this
 
02:16:46.719 --> 02:16:47.910 align:start position:0%
well who would like to speak on this
bill

02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
who has experience with conservation
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
issues uh she is involved perhaps in a
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
family emergency i believe she's on and
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
ready to testify but i just want to make
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
you aware in case uh she has to step
 
02:16:58.080 --> 02:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
you aware in case uh she has to step
away

02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
so i would like to start by talking
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
about the purpose of our current use rsa
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
obviously anytime you touch current use
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
rsa you're going to have a whole lot of
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
people interested in the issue and
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about whether or not the
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
changes are going to impact them
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
the current use law rsa 79a states i'm
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
going to shorten it uh it is hereby
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
declared to be in the public interest to
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
encourage reservation of open space
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
thus providing a helpful and attractive
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
outdoor environment for maintaining the
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
character of the state's landscape and
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
conserving the land water forest
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
agricultural and wildlife resources um
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
so i just give that very briefly as
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
background as to
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the idea of why we have current use law
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
at all obviously current use as we uh
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
look at it is the purpose is to protect
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
farmers and other stewards of our open
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
spaces who provide us with a lot of
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
necessary services while protecting our
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
open space while engaging in that
 
02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:01.190 align:start position:0%
open space while engaging in that
conservation

02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
um from the highest and best use tax
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
rate that private businesses um and
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
other entities that are not involved in
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
being stewards of our open spaces are
 
02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:12.629 align:start position:0%
being stewards of our open spaces are
doing

02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
however i would argue and i think it's
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty obvious from our say that i
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
just read that if the organization is
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
actually involved in damaging
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
our wild lands our wild habitats for our
 
02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:25.669 align:start position:0%
our wild lands our wild habitats for our
wildlife

02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
and not conserving it
 
02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:28.870 align:start position:0%
and not conserving it
then

02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
it would be an injustice to deny
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
from those municipalities that tax
 
02:18:34.479 --> 02:18:36.150 align:start position:0%
from those municipalities that tax
revenue

02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
that those businesses should be
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
contributing to when they are in fact
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
not contributing to the conservation of
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
wild uh wild lands and this is exactly
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
the case not frequently at all and i
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to make it very clear because i was
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
reached out to by a whole bunch of
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
different farming organizations and
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
private farmers worried about this
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
my intent in this is not to remotely
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
touch anyone we consider to be in the
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
farming or agricultural world
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
those people provide us with food and um
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
our tradition is deeply rooted in
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
farming uh i would never even think to
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
do that but we do have a couple not a
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
lot it looks like probably two
 
02:19:17.519 --> 02:19:18.549 align:start position:0%
lot it looks like probably two
um

02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
privately owned uh
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%

02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%

02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
of exotic species
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
and there have been numerous examples of
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
those exotic species causing problems
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
having the capacity to become invasive
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire primarily i am concerned
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
about one
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has the largest private uh
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%

02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
it it's called corbin park it is
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
famously um
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
private and exclusive uh
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of information on
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
for example their membership and dues
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
but from what little information um has
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
been made available through just
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
personal testimony it appears they have
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple dozen members uh almost
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
entirely from out of state a few maybe
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%

02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%

02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
and with approximately 26 mile perimeter
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
we don't know as i said already we don't
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
the all of these species that they
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
harbor there for this private hunting
 
02:20:42.399 --> 02:20:43.750 align:start position:0%

02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
recreation
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
but we do know that they
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
do quite a bit of harboring of eurasian
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
wild war
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who may not know
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
that is one of the species that has
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
become famously invasive in the south
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and in the southwest in devastating

02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
elk has the capacity to

02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%

02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
with our native white-tailed deer and
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
also it elk famously harbor a number of
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
diseases that are easily transmissible
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
to livestock animals um the elk as far
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
as i know have not yet become a real
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
world issue but certainly the bore most
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
definitely have uh numerous examples of
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the boar escaping the facilities causing
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
real awful and i would implore you to
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
ask the fish and game department i'm on
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
the fish and game committee myself about
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
the devastation that those boar have
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
done to our new hampshire public lands
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of rooting up vegetation
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
um and damaging habitat also the boar
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
have damaged uh private property as well
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can there's numerous examples of the
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
residents in the uh in the area that
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
have had their private property damage
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
the bore have also caused traffic
 
02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
the bore have also caused traffic
accidents

02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
and have actually procreated outside the
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
park now because this is a very private
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
these are not animals that fish and game
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
can regulate these are privately owned
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
animals it would be the same as if you
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
had cows on your property so when they
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
escape they are still considered under
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
law to be the private property of the
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
park but the escapes have happened so
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
much that now the board that have
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
managed to escape
 
02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:31.349 align:start position:0%
managed to escape
um

02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
while the law protects corbyn park to
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
say they can charge for the killing and
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
taking of those animals corbin park has
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
had to basically wave that because uh
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
just to enlist people to help control
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
the damage that the the wild boar are
 
02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.710 align:start position:0%
the damage that the the wild boar are
doing

02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:47.670 align:start position:0%
doing
um

02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
so the other uh facility i'm aware of
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
is a um a game bird
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh facility where uh and i believe uh
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
the akc uh has submitted testimony i
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
know she's here to testify
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
um and the idea is that these facilities
 
02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:06.469 align:start position:0%
um and the idea is that these facilities
are

02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
breeding or harboring
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
exotic game bird species to train
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh hunting dogs which is fine except for
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that again any anytime you have
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
the potential of a species becoming
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
invasive we're talking about encroaching
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
on our natural
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lands and i would uh posit
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we actually do have quite a number
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
of native uh game bird species that any
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
training facility could use in order to
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
train hunting dogs
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
um also i would like to point out that
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are a number of uh special laws in
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
fact the trans trespassing signs at
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
corbyn park highlight the fact that they
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
are protected by special law um for
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
those of you who may have seen some of
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
the news articles corbin park was
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
established by uh a i believe a steel or
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
railroad magnate named
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me austin corbin
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
um in the 1800s who was quite famously
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
very wealthy and powerful and
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
just as a way not as a way to inject any
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
other issues into this but just as a way
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead and acknowledge the articles
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
that have come out yes he originally
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
created the park as a private club for
 
02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
created the park as a private club for
wealthy

02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
wealthy
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
white non-jewish
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
men um i'm not trying to inject that in
 
02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
there but there have been a number of
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
news articles on that but that is not my
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue my issue is strictly on
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
conservation so as i said i do serve on
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
the fish and game committee i do
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
understand and respect that hunting when
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the context of science-based game
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
management plans is very important
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to our ecosystems we are not
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
talking about hunting in reference to
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
our natural native species we are
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
talking about bringing exotic possibly
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
invasive species that are doing damage
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
to our lands um and then
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
on top of allowing that which i'm not
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
suggesting we banned that
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
but on top of allowing that then giving
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
them a very very substantial tax
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh break which by all rights should go
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
to those towns
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
um so yes we are talking about the
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
privatizing of wild lands where they
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
stock exotic animals for
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
are animals willing to take some
 
02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:26.550 align:start position:0%
are animals willing to take some
questions

02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh i am i would i would just like to
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
close very briefly with saying that i
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
have been again reached out to a number
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
of farm and other uh concerned interests
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
in every single case i explained to them
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
my intent and asked them if there was
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
any language at all that they would like
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
me to use to amend it i my goal is to
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
protect the farming community and so i
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
have not received any language from them
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
but i am still very very much willing to
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
work with anyone who would like to
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
detail this language to make sure our
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
farming community is protected but yes i
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
will take questions and before you do
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
that can i ask you to submit your
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee
 
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee
sure

02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
represent a reporter has a question
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair let me get back on
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
screen here and thank you representative
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
reed for taking my question i'm not sure
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to this and i i know
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to this
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
um years ago when my life was different
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
i owned
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
my family owned a parcel of land that we
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
had in current use and we used it for
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
logging and um each so our property
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
taxes were reduced because of that but
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
we did have to pay a timber tax on the
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
proceeds of the logging
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
that went to the town
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
um do you know of any other
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
use of current use land
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that would produce an income
 
02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.670 align:start position:0%
that would produce an income
for

02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
someone produce revenue profit that
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to pay
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
anything into the town
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of taxes as a result
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that farmland is a
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
different thing but
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
any other use of current used land
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
that makes a profit for the owner
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
whereby the owner doesn't have to
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
compensate the town for the use of the
 
02:27:14.399 --> 02:27:15.349 align:start position:0%
compensate the town for the use of the
land

02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
other than thank you very much
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative porter for the question
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
other than the uh things that you
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned i know of none
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
um essentially businesses in the sense
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we think of businesses
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
would always have to pay some form of
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
tax uh and certainly that's even the
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
case for farms and as you mentioned
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
logging uh i would say as i stated in
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning of my testimony that in
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
the case of agriculture in the case
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
which i would extend to um the
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
harvesting of timber um these things
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
especially when they're done by and i
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
think we're mostly concerned about the
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
small farmer and the small time timber
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
harvesters you yourself were
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
these things can be done and should be
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
done in a sustainable way that works
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
with our natural ecosystem and not
 
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
against it so we do clear lands for
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
farmland for example so that's not
 
02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
farmland for example so that's not
simply

02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
not using the land you are using the
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
land but you're using it in a way that
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
is beneficial
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
for the ecosystem and beneficial for the
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
residents as well this is why we don't
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to tax them at that full highest
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
and best use rate they are protecting
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
the land and giving us something in this
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
type of situation that i've outlined and
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
i believe that the organization that
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
operates corbyn park is a non-profit and
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's not paying any kind of taxes um
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
in this in this is this is a situation
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
where it's not even really a business it
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
is a private club that is completely cut
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
off except for the fact that their
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
invasive animals are escaping and
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
causing damage
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
but there's really no oversight
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to my knowledge in all
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the years has only been on the
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
property once and only that was only
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
because a person was killed on the
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
property so there's really no oversight
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
over this particular property so i'm
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
again i'm not suggesting changing those
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
laws but i'm saying
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
there is no rationale therefore for then
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
giving them a giant tax break they
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
aren't doing the things that the other
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
entities like the timber harvesters and
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
the farmers are doing for for our
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
ecosystem in our community
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative reed for coming and
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
testifying i think you may have just
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
answered my question which was in regard
 
02:29:24.319 --> 02:29:25.349 align:start position:0%
answered my question which was in regard
to

02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is addressing the issue
 
02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
the bill is addressing the issue
of

02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
a private club
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
is receiving
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
a tax benefit
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
where they're not providing a benefit
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
back to the state of new hampshire in
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
the sense of
 
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
land that is open for
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
hiking or biking or
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
walking or
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
anything else because it's a private
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
make this private club pay
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the highest and best use for
 
02:30:08.309 --> 02:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
for taxes not the current use tax
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
because they are not benefiting
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
the state am i am i correct
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
you are 100 correct representative and
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
it was very succinctly and well put
 
02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:19.670 align:start position:0%
it was very succinctly and well put
um

02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
the details of corbin park it is
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
entirely surrounded by
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
the whole 26 miles of perimeter by a 12
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
foot high fence um which the boar are
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
very capable of burrowing under
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
um but uh there it's posted with no
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
trespassing and it's extremely well um
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh enforced and it's actually a lengthy
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
and kind of ominous sign that i'm happy
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
to share with the rest of the committee
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
so it is not open to any hiking bird
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
watching any kind of recreational use
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
outside of the people who are able to
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
afford the six figure ish membership
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
dues um and as you pointed out almost
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
all of the open spaces that we don't
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently do give current use um tax
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
credit to
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
can in fact enter into those agreements
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
to allow their spaces to be open to
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
hikers or even hunters that are actually
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
hunting our actual native species or
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
what have you any kind of recreational
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
activity but this is completely cut off
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
in its own bubble except for the fact
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
that their private animals that are
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
invasive keep escaping
 
02:31:25.349 --> 02:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
and next uh we have representative
 
02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:28.790 align:start position:0%
and next uh we have representative
nanchikuri

02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
nanchikuri
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative reed for uh taking my
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
question you talked about the invasive
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh non-native species of animals
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
breeding or growing in this how are
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
their feeding habits changing our
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
ecosystem in terms of vegetation because
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
they are non-native and i have two-part
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
question to that
 
02:31:53.439 --> 02:31:54.830 align:start position:0%
question to that
and

02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
also you know you talked about the
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
diseases that they bring how it is
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
affecting our natural ecosystem in terms
 
02:32:04.870 --> 02:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
of our
 
02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:05.910 align:start position:0%
of our
native

02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
native
 
02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.950 align:start position:0%
native
um

02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:08.230 align:start position:0%
um
animals

02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
animals
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the native vegetation because
 
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
we are bringing a non-native invasive
 
02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:16.309 align:start position:0%
we are bringing a non-native invasive
um

02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
could become invasive and could affect
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
our natural ecosystem in new hampshire
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
which is our prime
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
duel or that's our basic
 
02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:33.030 align:start position:0%
duel or that's our basic
treasure

02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
treasure
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the question
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative magna pudi um
 
02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:37.670 align:start position:0%
representative magna pudi um
i

02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
not being an employee of the fish and
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
game wildlife uh division uh don't have
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
detailed information but they do have it
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
on their website and i'm very happy to
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
send those links over to you all uh in
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
the committee um however very broadly i
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
can say that the wild boar i know we
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't when we talk about endangered
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
species we frequently don't talk about
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh plant species but we do have
 
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
endangered plant species wild boar can
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
upset the habitat for those endangered
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
plant species as well as habitat for um
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
or not just in danger but just
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
threatened uh animal species as well in
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the disease and in the wild
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
boar i think you can make a good
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
argument that they already have become
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
invasive because there are um instances
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
of individual board that appear to not
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
have come directly from the park but
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
maybe have actually bred outside of the
 
02:33:26.479 --> 02:33:27.510 align:start position:0%
maybe have actually bred outside of the
park

02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
park
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
as they have done very extensively in
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
the south and southwest parts of the
 
02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:32.469 align:start position:0%
the south and southwest parts of the
country

the

disease that i mentioned in particular
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
with reference to elk which as i as far
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
as i know has not escaped the park yet
 
02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
as i know has not escaped the park yet
um

02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that the elk could
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
out-compete our native white-tailed deer
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
but more importantly than that and
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
possibly moose though they do use
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
slightly different food sources but more
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
importantly they are a giant carrier of
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
several diseases including wasting
 
02:33:56.399 --> 02:33:57.429 align:start position:0%
several diseases including wasting
disease

02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
disease
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
which is currently
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
really impacting new hampshire's uh both
 
02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:02.630 align:start position:0%
really impacting new hampshire's uh both
our

02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
threatened moose population and our
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
native whitetail deer population which
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
is uh uh
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
is not as threatened obviously um but
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
that is the extent of my knowledge but
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
there is more information i'm happy to
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
can i ask a follow-up question mr
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
chairman follow-up though let's uh let's
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
understand that we have nine additional
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
speakers on this bill
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up in terms of we address the
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
animals then the birds gaming birds so
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's a whole system ecosystem that's
 
02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:44.710 align:start position:0%
there's a whole system ecosystem that's
being

02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
shifted because of introducing
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
non-native species not only birds
 
02:34:51.359 --> 02:34:52.469 align:start position:0%
non-native species not only birds
animals

02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
animals
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
plants and how the pollination happens
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
outside the farm i mean outside this
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
private land and how it affects the
 
02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:02.550 align:start position:0%
private land and how it affects the
neighboring

02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
neighboring
 
02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
neighboring
farm

02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
farm
 
02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
farm
farmland

02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
farmland
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
because of the vegetation changing
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
it is thank you representative
 
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
magnafoody it is a prime tenant of
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
conservation sciences all of the
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
different conservation science
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
disciplines um that we do not introduce
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh non-native species um or
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
there have been examples of of the
 
02:35:28.389 --> 02:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
attempt to introduce non-native species
 
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
for other control issues mainly to deal
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
and remedy issues that were caused by
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
other non-native species being
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
introduced so it is a tenet to not do
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
that and certainly as you mentioned um
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
our tourism industry which comes to you
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
know comes to see
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
our wildlands
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
is our number two uh business in new
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire number two industry so we want
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
to protect that at all costs okay next
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
we have a question from representative
 
02:35:59.270 --> 02:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
lasallis and here in the llp
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's it seems to me
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
is attempting
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
to control non-native species
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
aren't there other laws that we have in
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
for controlling for instance wild boars
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative lisales
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
the short answer to that is essentially
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
no unless i think you were purposely
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
like bringing them in and purposely
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
releasing them but if you think about
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
any of our farms uh while i did exclude
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
non-domesticated species in order to
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
exclude all your regular farm species
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
but you know a cow is non-native right
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
you you can bring a cow there's no
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
regulation on you except for maybe your
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
possible your municipal zoning
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances there's no real regulation on
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
you for bringing a cow into new
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire and if the cow escapes it
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
escapes a lot of domesticated species
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
cannot become invasive because they over
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know many many many years of
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
breeding have become utterly dependent
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
upon human beings especially in our
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
rather unforgiving
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
climate but we do know obviously
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
wildlife in new hampshire exists and so
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of species that can
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
adapt to our climate um
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
so there's not a whole lot of good
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know laws in terms of you can't
 
02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
you know laws in terms of you can't
introduce

02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's some good laws around aquatic
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
species i think you can be fined for not
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
cleaning off the whole of your boat for
 
02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
cleaning off the whole of your boat for
example

02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:37.830 align:start position:0%
example
but

02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any laws that would do
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
that and more specifically to the point
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
while yes i am my main concern is
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
to say that i'm simply trying to get rid
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
of people bringing in non-native species
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
is not exactly the point of the bill the
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
point of the bill as representative
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
truleven very succinctly stated is that
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
we give current use for a very specific
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
reason we are getting something out of
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
it either in the stewardship of our wild
 
02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
it either in the stewardship of our wild
lands

02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
lands
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
in our ecosystem or you know in the
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
sense of provisions of food preferably
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a sustainable way
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
we aren't getting anything the state of
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not getting anything
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
from this particular type of facility it
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
is not helping our ecosystem it's
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
damaging our ecosystem and these areas
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
are not open for people tourists or
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise unless they have a good good
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
chunk of money to to enjoy those lands
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and again twenty six thousand acres
 
02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.150 align:start position:0%
and again twenty six thousand acres

02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
you representative reed for taking my
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
question i'm curious if you have
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
considered or would consider
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
putting in some reference to how we
 
02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:49.030 align:start position:0%
putting in some reference to how we
define

02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
define
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
non-native and non-domesticated species
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that it is so that it removes the
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and i apologize if that
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
question was asked
 
02:38:59.030 --> 02:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh before
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that question
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%

i

02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:05.510 align:start position:0%
i
i

02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
i could say that me putting this bill in
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out what language
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
would be suitable was a heartache
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
because i
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
understand the need to balance ambiguity
 
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
like intentional ambiguity and broadness
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
with specificity
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
i opted for the simplest language i mean
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
you can also use that argument around
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
the word um harbor like what does it
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
mean to harbor
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and what i did instead is i just put
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
it out in the simplest language possible
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that if i tried to drill down
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
on different details that's more that
 
02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know for us to fight over and i want
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
to just put out once again that i put it
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
in this broad language
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
or simple language not really broad but
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
um despite the fact that there is there
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
are definitions for invasive under rules
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know about statute
 
02:39:54.389 --> 02:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
um and also domesticated we have we well
 
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
we actually do have statute that does
 
02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
define domesticated species already so
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
um we do have some definition already
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm putting it out in the simplest
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
terms because i am very open to any kind
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
of amendment as you stated
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
in working with any party to amend this
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
in order to to get the right balance and
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
the right specificity down because again
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
this is not about 99.99 percent of the
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
organizations getting current use in our
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
in our state it's really as far as i can
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
tell only two organizations that are
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
potentially damaging our our ecosystems
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
and are receiving massive tax credits
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
for doing so
 
02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lange
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang so in
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
another half as as representative as i'm
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
also chairman of fish and games so my
 
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
question is around the conversation of
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
harboring non-native and
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
non-domesticated animals and as we had
 
02:40:51.270 --> 02:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
that naming the trout bill and we found
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
out there basically no more native trout
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that we've through our
 
02:40:57.830 --> 02:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
our stocking policies have
 
02:40:57.840 --> 02:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
our stocking policies have
um

02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:58.880 --> 02:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
um
basically

02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
overridden a lot of our native trout um
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
and also around fish and games stocking
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
a pheasant which is not
 
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
a pheasant which is not
uh

02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh a non this is a non-native animal my
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
concern is could we be sweeping in some
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
farms that allow fish and game to stop
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
their their brooks and tryouts as well
 
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
as their fields with our with the
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
pheasant when they do their restocking
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
where those farms now have to give up
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
their current use rights
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
well that's certainly not my intention
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
my chair
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
again i'm very open to any kind of
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
language that would get down to that
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
specificity if if we think that might be
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
i am specifically talking about
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that get the current use
 
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:46.389 align:start position:0%
organizations that get the current use
credit

02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
the kind of bubble nature of bringing in
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
exotic species so um once again not
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
trying to impact 99.99
 
02:41:58.230 --> 02:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
of the organizations that do including
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the people who are just getting uh
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
current use and are allowing the fish
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and game department themselves to stock
 
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:04.630 align:start position:0%
and game department themselves to stock
species

02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
species
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you our representative mcdonald
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you remember mcdonald's
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative reed for taking my
 
02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
representative reed for taking my
question

02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:24.230 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
following up on the previous question
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
from your chair
 
02:42:31.270 --> 02:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you would be amenable to an
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to the language that
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
specifically cited
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions for private hunting clubs
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that if that that would
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
solve it
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
um i yes i'm i'm open to any
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
any amendment that gets to the
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
aforementioned purposes of my bill as
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
i've said repeatedly
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's this very very specific problem so
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
anyone who can offer language that gets
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
to that in a way that upsets the least
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no additional questions for
 
02:43:09.270 --> 02:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative reid
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
to move on to my next
 
02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:13.110 align:start position:0%
to move on to my next
testimony

02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:18.950 align:start position:0%
testimony
from

02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
yes good morning does every can everyone
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
hear me yes go right ahead oh thank you
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
very much mr chairman and thank you to
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
the members of the county municipal
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
government committee
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
um i come before you to speak in support
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
of hb 46 i'm yeah 467 i'm sorry and um i
 
02:43:48.870 --> 02:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
submitted my written testimony
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
very early this morning so you should
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
have that
 
02:43:55.269 --> 02:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
as ones who love new hampshire and all
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
that makes our state special i'm sure
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
that you join me in appreciating this
 
02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
that you join me in appreciating this
bill

02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
it reflects on the intent of our state's
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
current use statute to preserve the
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
natural and traditional land use in the
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
however the new hampshire advantage
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally relies on assessing
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
non-current use property to raise tax
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
revenue to fund local services including
 
02:44:22.230 --> 02:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
public education we have been successful
 
02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
since current use passed into law in
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
1973 in balancing lower revenues from
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
land and current use with regular tax
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
rates for other properties but it is
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with current use when land is
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
used to in but it is not consistent with
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
current use when land is used to
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
introduce non-native non-domesticated
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
animals for private paid recreational
 
02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:44.870 align:start position:0%
animals for private paid recreational
hunting

02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
is the legislative intent for wealthy
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
out-of-state hunters to stock private
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
land public use forbidden with
 
02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
non-native species and pay handsomely to
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
hunt them
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
is it worth the risk of destroying the
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
habitat of our native species is that
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire way i don't think so
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that the current youth statute
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
needs to clarify that its intent is to
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
protect the natural and cultural
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
heritage of new hampshire
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
that is what this bill does
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i respectfully ask that you
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass thank you and um
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
also there's a couple things that came
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
to mind as representative reed was
 
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
to mind as representative reed was
speaking

02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
one is that um she's referred to corbyn
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
park but
 
02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
currently it's being referred to as the
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
blue mountain forest and game preserve
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
so if you are doing your own research or
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
background on this
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
you will find that name comes up quite a
 
02:45:40.319 --> 02:45:41.269 align:start position:0%
you will find that name comes up quite a
bit

02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a person who
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
actually has logged in an entire history
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the blue mountain forest and game
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
preserve from back in the day when it
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
was established by austin corbin
 
02:45:54.399 --> 02:45:55.269 align:start position:0%
was established by austin corbin
and

02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's under a website called em it's
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
mayette dot u s slash corbin park it's m
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
e y e t t e
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
dot u s slash corbin park you will find
 
02:46:12.550 --> 02:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
a wealth of information there on this
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
much of it is anecdotal so i didn't want
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
to repeat it but if you want to get an
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
overall sense
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
then that that would be a good place to
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
go to
 
02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
i also want to address a couple other
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
comments that
 
02:46:26.790 --> 02:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
that were raised by
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
this committee during representative
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
reid's testimony
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
one is regarding the non-native trout
 
02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.190 align:start position:0%
one is regarding the non-native trout
yes

02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
the non-native trout have pretty much
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
replaced our native trout but they are
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
contained within a lake or a water body
 
02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:43.750 align:start position:0%
contained within a lake or a water body
so

02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
unlike land where non-native species can
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
expand and there's just really no
 
02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:50.070 align:start position:0%
expand and there's just really no
boundary

02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
boundary
 
02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
invasive species in a water body can be
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
controlled um
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
i know that in uh we've had serious
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
issues in new hampshire lakes and rivers
 
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
with not invasive species of the plant
 
02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
with not invasive species of the plant
species

02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
species
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
and even then it can still be controlled
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
to some extent we work very very hard to
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
control those species
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and it it and the danger is we can
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
get to a point where we're just running
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
in place that we may not eradicate them
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
but we can manage them
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i know with the situation with wild
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
boar that have escaped
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
they go in and do a lot of crop damage
 
02:47:29.910 --> 02:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
of farms
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
they also displace some of the
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
food that native animals need
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative reed spoke
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
about the disease that can be spread
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
from elk to white-tailed deer
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
so i just want to bring that up um
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
i i've served on the uh aquatic invasive
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
species commission so i've
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the the uh risk and threat that are
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
posed when we
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
allow non-native species to enter our
 
02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:04.630 align:start position:0%
allow non-native species to enter our
ecosystem

02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
ecosystem
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
and that being said i would be very
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative ron for taking my
 
02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
representative ron for taking my
question

02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:48:18.319 --> 02:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
you spoke about
 
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know both representative reed and i
 
02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
large forest in green game preserve uh
 
02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
26 000 acres of land
 
02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:38.790 align:start position:0%
26 000 acres of land
uh

02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
02:48:40.399 --> 02:48:41.510 align:start position:0%
are there any
other

02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
that you know off in our state that may
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
not be this large but they are
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
areas

02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:54.230 align:start position:0%
areas
to

02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
kind of take over
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
in my second question is in terms of
 
02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:01.910 align:start position:0%
in my second question is in terms of
um

02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
ticks and other parasites that live on
 
02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
animal body
 
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
how does
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
non-native uh animals carry some of
 
02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
non-native uh animals carry some of
those

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
parasites on them
 
02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
that can
 
02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:20.070 align:start position:0%
that can
spread

02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
spread
 
02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
diseases not only to the animals and the
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
environment but also the human because
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
they bring
 
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
new kind of parasite
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
like the lyme disease for example that
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
is native but are the other ones that
 
02:49:37.269 --> 02:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
can bring
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative manchapudi for
 
02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
your question uh for the first question
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
no i'm not aware of any other um
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
hunting clubs or preserves that are
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
being formed
 
02:49:52.469 --> 02:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
i first heard about corbyn park a few
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
years ago and my first question is
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
why are they under current use because
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a current use when we look back
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
at our natural and cultural heritage of
 
02:50:05.269 --> 02:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to have exotic hunting
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
clubs especially ones that take up 26
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
000 acres
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's it to me it my biggest issue
 
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
with the situation and it's not just it
 
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
could be anybody it's just that
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
using current use laws
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect the intent
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
of the state the lawmakers that drafted
 
02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:29.990 align:start position:0%
of the state the lawmakers that drafted
it

02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
and in our government i mean when we go
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
through new hampshire and we look at
 
02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
tracks of land that are in current use
 
02:50:39.110 --> 02:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful thing uh it's a
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
beautiful thing to see the florists
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
where people are allowed to hike through
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to go in and hunt
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
and they hunt native animals
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
but when you have such a large track
 
02:50:54.309 --> 02:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
like um the blue mountain forest and
 
02:50:56.790 --> 02:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
game preserve also known as corbin park
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
where the public is strictly not allowed
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
to go on um and if they did they're not
 
02:51:04.230 --> 02:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
hunting our native species they're
 
02:51:06.950 --> 02:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
hunting wild boar elk
 
02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
bison actually that uh
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
corbin park used to be the largest
 
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh had the largest herd of bison in the
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
east of the mississippi at one point
 
02:51:18.479 --> 02:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
east of the mississippi at one point
so

02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:20.469 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:51:20.469 --> 02:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's a club
 
02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money involved but as
 
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative reed said it's very
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
secretive about what their finances is
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
but in totality of looking of all of
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't seem consistent with the
 
02:51:34.710 --> 02:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
intent of current use
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
and my argument is then why is it
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
oh and i'm sorry your second question
 
02:51:47.269 --> 02:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
sorry represent manchester united no i'm
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
not aware of it but um what i know of um
 
02:51:54.309 --> 02:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking of uh exotic
 
02:51:54.319 --> 02:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
and generally speaking of uh exotic
species

02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
species
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
that over time they do cause a lot of
 
02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
damage we see it particularly now with
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
insects non-native insects coming in and
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
destroying tracks of of of timber
 
02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
there was one species that was a real
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
problem for new hampshire before covid
 
02:52:15.030 --> 02:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
where we had to really restrict people
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
bringing in firewood from out of state
 
02:52:19.349 --> 02:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:52:19.359 --> 02:52:20.230 align:start position:0%
um so
it's

02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
protecting our state against
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-invasive species
 
02:52:26.710 --> 02:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
is is is a lot of work it's we have to
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
be diligent all the time
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
but thank you for your questions
 
02:52:32.230 --> 02:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
next question is from representative
 
02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:33.830 align:start position:0%
next question is from representative
blank

02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
blank
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question i
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
guess my question is it said i believe
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
you served on a current use commission
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
of some sort
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
my conversation with the fish and game
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
executive director recently
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
i learned that there were three million
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
acres in new hampshire under current use
 
02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
but only 1.5 actually allow recreational
 
02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:53.190 align:start position:0%
but only 1.5 actually allow recreational
access

02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
is that consistent with what you know uh
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative lang the uh commission
 
02:53:01.510 --> 02:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm on is actually the aquatic invasive
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
species commission i'm not on the
 
02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
current use commission
 
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
i i i think a lot of the land that is in
 
02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
current use is pretty inaccessible it's
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
in the great northern in the great north
 
02:53:17.439 --> 02:53:18.389 align:start position:0%
in the great northern in the great north
woods

02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
woods
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
i do know um when you look at our
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
snowmobile clubs people are allowed to
 
02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
cross on private property to travel
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
through to get to another trail
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
i learned a lot about that last year i
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
was on resources committee and we
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
studied a lot about
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
jericho state park up in berlin
 
02:53:41.349 --> 02:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know there are uses
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
when we look back on what new hampshire
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
is and why we love new hampshire when we
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
look at current use those are uses that
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
make our state a better state
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
it preserves what's important to new
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and what makes you new
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire unique
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh when i look at people using current
 
02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
use for um
 
02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
exotic animals hunting and trust me i
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
i um support hunting 100 percent
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
but it's almost turning a big swath of
 
02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
current use into safari like where we're
 
02:54:15.510 --> 02:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
hunting animals that would never be
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
found naturally
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
is that an appropriate use to be under
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
current use and my opinion is it is not
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay the next question is from
 
02:54:28.389 --> 02:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
representing stages
 
02:54:30.150 --> 02:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative reed for taking yet
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
another question from me um i
 
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
look at this bill almost as trying to
 
02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:40.230 align:start position:0%
look at this bill almost as trying to
put

02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
put
 
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
the left-handed glove on the right hand
 
02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:43.750 align:start position:0%
the left-handed glove on the right hand
it's

02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the real issue here
 
02:54:49.269 --> 02:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
is that this private club
 
02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
is exempt from taxation
 
02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:53.269 align:start position:0%
is exempt from taxation
not

02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know the the invasive non-native
 
02:54:58.469 --> 02:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
species argument
 
02:55:02.230 --> 02:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know starlings are invasive species
 
02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
emus and llamas are non-native to new
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire i just don't know where that
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
argument begins or ends
 
02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
but it does seem to me that the central
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
the nub of it
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
is the tax status of this private club
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
am i incorrect in that
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the question
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
representatives davis i think the key
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
word here is domesticated when we look
 
02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:27.670 align:start position:0%
word here is domesticated when we look
at

02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:55:30.070 --> 02:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
emu llama farms in new hampshire i think
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's a couple llama farms
 
02:55:34.389 --> 02:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county that i'm aware of
 
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're domesticated they're used
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're being used for agricultural
 
02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:40.309 align:start position:0%
they're being used for agricultural
business

02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that's consistent with new hampshire
 
02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're not exotic in the fact that
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
they're they're allowed to roam freely
 
02:55:51.750 --> 02:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
to invade on an ecosystem of native
 
02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:52.950 align:start position:0%
to invade on an ecosystem of native
species

02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
species
 
02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the key differential
 
02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:56.070 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the key differential
point

02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:55:57.910 --> 02:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that we're talking
 
02:55:57.920 --> 02:55:58.950 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that we're talking
about

02:55:58.950 --> 02:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
exotic species being introduced and for
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
all intents and purposes
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
um just having free reign over our
 
02:56:09.190 --> 02:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
natural ecosystems
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative reed spoke about the 26
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
mile fence well that fence is not
 
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
maintained very well it's very common
 
02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:17.990 align:start position:0%
maintained very well it's very common
for

02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
especially wild boar to escape
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
and and now they're starting to breed
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
outside of that preserve so
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
when you look at farms or agricultural
 
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
facilities that are raising animals that
 
02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
are not native to new hampshire that's
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
essentially more of a farm they're being
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're contained they're being raised
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
for a purpose they're domesticated
 
02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the i think that's the
 
02:56:46.469 --> 02:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
um the the main point and that to me
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
that domestication agricultural business
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
is very consistent with the spirit of
 
02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
current use
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
our next uh speaker is going to be
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative mason uh just to queue
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
him up we have additional questions from
 
02:57:01.429 --> 02:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
the committee from representatives
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:09.429 --> 02:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
um i'm all set okay i've had my question
 
02:57:11.670 --> 02:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
answered thank you mr chair
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
all right i want to uh
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
next recognize representative mason
 
02:57:18.469 --> 02:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
who'd like to speak against the bill
 
02:57:20.550 --> 02:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
mr chair and committee
 
02:57:22.479 --> 02:57:23.190 align:start position:0%
mr chair and committee
um

02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
i'm in opposition to house bill 467 and
 
02:57:29.349 --> 02:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
i ask you to motion to itl this bill
 
02:57:31.110 --> 02:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire current land use is really
 
02:57:34.389 --> 02:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
developed in 1973 by the general court
 
02:57:36.389 --> 02:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the law is to save new
 
02:57:38.469 --> 02:57:38.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire's open space
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
by allowing private land known as an
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
affordable tax base for rural land usage
 
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's been established in a long proven
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
track record of success in our state
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
current use tax strategy works
 
02:57:53.670 --> 02:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
congruently maintaining open land while
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
reducing urban sprawl
 
02:57:58.230 --> 02:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
resulting in protecting our privately
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
owned forest agricultural lands wetlands
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
and wildlife habitat
 
02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
additional incentives are allowed for
 
02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
forestry stewardship programs thus
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
creating enhanced timber yield and

our quote-unquote
 
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire natural environment

representative thank you for that
question

03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
26 000 acres there's actually 1.33
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
million acres of current land use that
 
03:05:14.230 --> 03:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
is not open in the state of new
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire to the general public the
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
landowner has the right to restrict it
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
by paying a higher fee on his
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
property tax and the current land use
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
they do pay property tax it's a reduced
 
03:05:28.230 --> 03:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
rate so the land can stay open and it
 
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
can be used for services farmers
 
03:05:33.190 --> 03:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to farm the land at the
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
same tax rate that a house is taxed at
 
03:05:40.070 --> 03:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and and their homes those that you
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
that are familiar with current land use
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
your home site and that you it's broken
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
off the areas around your home you pay a
 
03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
full tax rate for that property
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay you get the break on the back land
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
the land that's used for for timber
 
03:05:57.750 --> 03:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
management the land that's used for just
 
03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh swamp land in new hampshire we've got
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh wetland in new hampshire so
 
03:06:05.349 --> 03:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
those tax breaks are currently there
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
there if you've uh
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
ever have had chance to go up and see
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
the properties of corbin park a lot of
 
03:06:14.230 --> 03:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's just the side of a mountain it's
 
03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
very rugged land a lot of it
 
03:06:16.479 --> 03:06:17.269 align:start position:0%
very rugged land a lot of it
um

03:06:17.269 --> 03:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:19.990 --> 03:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of vistas and views
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
we've seen people
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
pull land out of current land use they
 
03:06:23.439 --> 03:06:24.469 align:start position:0%
pull land out of current land use they
pay

03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:06:24.479 --> 03:06:26.790 align:start position:0%
pay
a

03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
penalty for that when it comes out when
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
they develop it
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
this tax break
 
03:06:35.190 --> 03:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
current land use has worked well to keep
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
 
03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:39.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's
scenic

03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
scenic
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and if we start to meddle with it we're
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to lose that scenic look that we
 
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
we all so much love new hampshire for
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%

things up like sonari
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
does this
 
03:07:48.399 --> 03:07:49.429 align:start position:0%
does this
can

03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
that be imposed on this current
 
03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
land use
 
03:07:55.840 --> 03:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
land use
and

03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
my second part is
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
there was a disease which dutch elm
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
disease that destroyed or killed
 
03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
all our elm trees
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
and it didn't take too long for that to
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
happen and to bring those dutch elms
 
03:08:14.880 --> 03:08:16.150 align:start position:0%
happen and to bring those dutch elms
back

03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.120 --> 03:08:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:08:25.830 --> 03:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
i'm asking about the question in terms
 
03:08:28.479 --> 03:08:29.269 align:start position:0%
i'm asking about the question in terms
of

03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the taxi you know land use
 
03:08:33.670 --> 03:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
hold on a second please hold back
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
playing water yes listen
 
03:08:37.510 --> 03:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're uh
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
two dollars behind here
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
i i like to
 
03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
move things to speed things up a little
 
03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
bit a number of questions
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
those kind of questions could be
 
03:08:53.590 --> 03:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
discussed possibly during our executive
 
03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:54.790 align:start position:0%
discussed possibly during our executive
session

03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
i understand the point uh
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
so let me just express to the committee
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be brief in your questions and make
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
sure that the questions um she's
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
catholized but
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
to representative mason
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
how long you know are you aware of the
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
fact that we lost
 
03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
elm trees for dutch elm disease from the
 
03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
beetle that came outside it was a
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
invasive beetle
 
03:09:42.830 --> 03:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
and it's taking much longer so this
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
could if we don't take
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
notice right now this could affect our
 
03:09:52.150 --> 03:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
natural beauty in new hampshire
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
and isn't that our responsibility
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
to be the stuarters of
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
well i
 
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i think i
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.590 --> 03:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
it is our duty to police a lot of
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
invasion species
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:22.230 --> 03:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
the dutch elm disease that you speak
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
about that happened back when i was a
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
kid about 60 years ago and
 
03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of the bigger ones probably right
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
now is is the beetle that came into
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and started this spread
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
and we've shut down a lot of border
 
03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
lines with timber being able to cross
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
state lines and issues like that we do a
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
lot of preventative things to do that um
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
aphis comes in aphis is a animal plant
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
health federal programs and they come in
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
and they they'll take over some of those
 
03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:54.630 align:start position:0%
and they they'll take over some of those
uh

03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
programs to make sure things are handled
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
properly like with that but
 
03:11:01.590 --> 03:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
these animals
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
are really an eco-fusion animal they've
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
been here for a long time
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
these species didn't come in last week
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh that we see inside corbin park uh the
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
pheasant has been here a long time
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
um the pigeon has been here a long time
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
species that have come in now i can tell
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
you point blank from pigeons
 
03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
as as raising animals i have had animals
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
be condemned because of avian tb so does
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that mean we do away of all the pigeons
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
that are in the state of new hampshire
 
03:11:39.670 --> 03:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
but i have lost revenue and income on my
 
03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
farm because i've had to do away
 
03:11:44.230 --> 03:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
with animals
 
03:11:44.240 --> 03:11:45.190 align:start position:0%
with animals
so

03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
this becomes a very complicated question
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't think um there are many of
 
03:11:53.349 --> 03:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
us qualified to really answer it
 
03:11:53.359 --> 03:11:55.510 align:start position:0%
us qualified to really answer it
um

03:11:55.510 --> 03:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know how else to answer that for
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
you but that's uh
 
03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative grayson i'm

federation
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
the mission of the new hampshire
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
wildlife federation is to be the leading
 
03:12:38.630 --> 03:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
advocate for the promotion and
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
protection of hunting fishing and
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
trapping as well as a conservation of
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
and access to fish and wildlife habitat

with a affiliated membership of over 48
 
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
000 the new hampshire wildlife

members from across the state
 
03:12:55.510 --> 03:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire wildlife federation
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
would ask you to oppose house bill 467
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
and any attempts to target specific
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
properties currently eligible for
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
current use
 
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
the new new hampshire is home to
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
multiple shooting and hunting preserves
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
which would all likely go out of
 
03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
business if this bill were to become law
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
these preserves operate on large track
 
03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
of pristine and undeveloped land which
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
are maintained and protected to maximize
 
03:13:19.349 --> 03:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
if these properties were no longer
 
03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:22.309 align:start position:0%
if these properties were no longer
eligible

03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
for current use status the owners would
 
03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
likely need to sell the land putting
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
large amount of protected land at risk
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
of development and permanent loss
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
hunting preserves in new hampshire are
 
03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
source of revenue for the state
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
these facilities bring in tourists and
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
often host events which generate revenue
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
these properties also bring out state
 
03:13:44.790 --> 03:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
tourists into more rural areas in new
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire which benefit other local
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
businesses for this reason above new
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%

03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
with my time
 
03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
several hunting preserve sporting dog
 
03:16:48.790 --> 03:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
kennels receive incentives under the
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
current use tax assessment by conserving
 
03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
the land water forest agriculture and
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
wildlife resources on their properties
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
because these operations use non-native
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
species under house bill 467 they would
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
become ineligible to receive the open
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
space land benefits and it's not
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to surmise that some of
 
03:17:09.429 --> 03:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
these locations may look to
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
commercialize or develop their land
 
03:17:14.550 --> 03:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
national participation in hunting has
 
03:17:17.110 --> 03:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
been on a general decline and shooting
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
preserves offer new sportsmen and women
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
with the ideal opportunity to experience
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
time of field in a learning environment
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
additionally on these properties hunters
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
will often spend time on the site's
 
03:17:30.309 --> 03:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
shooting range which
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with shots taken in the
 
03:17:34.150 --> 03:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
pursuit of game
 
03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
reflects contributions made to the
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
american system of conservation funding
 
03:17:41.110 --> 03:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
a user pays public benefits structure
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
under which those who consumptively use
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
the resources
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
pay for the privilege and oftentimes the
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
right to do so in 2020 alone new
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire sports men and women generated
 
03:17:52.150 --> 03:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
around 18 million dollars for
 
03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
conservation through this system
 
03:17:56.469 --> 03:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
part of which includes excise taxes on
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
sporting related goods such as
 
03:17:57.920 --> 03:17:59.190 align:start position:0%
sporting related goods such as
ammunition

03:17:59.190 --> 03:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
ammunition
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh another consideration i'd like to
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
provide is the effect that this bill
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
would have on sporting dog kennels um
 
03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
these kennels offer true conditions for
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
sportsmen and women to train their dogs
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
many kennels use non-native species in
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
their programs uh speaking from
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
experience my black lab trains over
 
03:18:18.710 --> 03:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
birds that are non-native
 
03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
birds that are non-native
um

03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:22.070 --> 03:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
so i know i'm short on time here uh with
 
03:18:24.070 --> 03:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
this in mind uh
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
not all hunting preserves and sporting
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
dog kennels use non-native species such
 
03:18:31.830 --> 03:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
as pheasant and hungarian partridges and
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
despite these game birds being a staple
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
pursuit in the upland hunting community
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
their existence in north america by
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
virtue makes them non-native and
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
non-domesticated uh once again i'd like
 
03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your time
 
03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
and reiterate my opposition to house
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill 467 thank
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:18:54.309 --> 03:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
seeing uh the next speaker is that it
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
will be jason stock
 
03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire timberland owners
 
03:19:01.760 --> 03:19:04.229 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire timberland owners
association

03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:19:06.229 --> 03:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
i've got two minutes for you just to
 
03:19:06.239 --> 03:19:09.750 align:start position:0%
i've got two minutes for you just to
stop

03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
good good afternoon can you hear me yes
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you and and thank you for
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify
 
03:19:19.830 --> 03:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is jason stock
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive director of the new
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire timberland owners association
 
03:19:27.190 --> 03:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have about 300 members who own
 
03:19:29.910 --> 03:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
and manage over a million acres of land
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
and most if not all of that is in
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
current use
 
03:19:35.910 --> 03:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
and what's important to note is that
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
these landowners
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
everyone has a different management
 
03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
everyone has a different management
objective

03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
objective
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
um there are landowners that object that
 
03:19:43.200 --> 03:19:43.910 align:start position:0%
um there are landowners that object that
that

03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
manage or their objectives include
 
03:19:48.150 --> 03:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
recreation which could which could
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
include hunting hiking bird watching and
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
of course forest products
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
as well as just owning land for the sake
 
03:19:59.429 --> 03:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
of owning land for its natural beauty
 
03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
but if as mr johnson
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh had mentioned that current use is
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
really a fundamental underpinning to
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
private timberland ownership in the
 
03:20:08.720 --> 03:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
private timberland ownership in the
state

03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
and the the last clause in the in the
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
purpose or the declaration of the law
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the sponsors
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
reading the first portion but the last
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
portion is just as important and that is
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
it shall encourage but not require
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
management practices on open space lands
 
03:20:32.070 --> 03:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
under current use assessment
 
03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
in other words current use is blind to
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
how the land is going to be managed it's
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
a very simple law and that's one of the
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
beauties of this law is that it looks
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
simply at is it developed or is it open
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and based on that that will
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
determine whether you are
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
eligible it doesn't get into are you
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
growing are you growing corn versus
 
03:21:03.030 --> 03:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
trees are you managing for wildlife
 
03:21:05.429 --> 03:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
versus managing for timber
 
03:21:07.590 --> 03:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the beauties of the law
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it's one of the things that makes
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's i would argue one of the
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
best open space laws and policies in in
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:16.870 align:start position:0%
the nation
um

03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
there was talk in the earlier about
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know that that it's a tax break and
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
i always bristle a little bit because
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's not really a tax break what it is
 
03:21:30.389 --> 03:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
is it's an assessment of the land on its
 
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
ability to grow a farm product
 
03:21:37.110 --> 03:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
or a timber product it is a different
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
way of assessing land
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to say growing single-family
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
homes growing commercial development it
 
03:21:47.190 --> 03:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
is an assessment on it
 
03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:48.150 align:start position:0%
is an assessment on it
and

03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:49.990 --> 03:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is doc this is a chair can i ask
 
03:21:53.110 --> 03:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
you to try to rap yep and i'll just
 
03:21:55.190 --> 03:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the benefits um i just want to also
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
mention that there was talk about
 
03:21:58.960 --> 03:22:00.389 align:start position:0%
mention that there was talk about
benefits

03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
their current use land is eligible you
 
03:22:04.950 --> 03:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
can post it
 
03:22:08.070 --> 03:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
but even posted land provides benefits
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
such as scenic abilities
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
clean air clean water etc and i would
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
argue that that holds true to corbyn
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
park it is clear this bill was
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
introduced targeting a specific
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
landowner because
 
03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
landowner because
they

03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
someone does not agree with how they're
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
what they're managing for
 
03:22:30.630 --> 03:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i urge you to vote
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:22:37.590 --> 03:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate your time this
 
03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you

the committee
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
seeing the next speaker i'm going to
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%

which is a conservation group focused on
 
03:23:28.630 --> 03:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
the improvement of pollinator and upland
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%

well as small game
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
far view farm is a mixed use property we

have hay fields grow buckwheat sorghum
 
03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
corn have wetlands a pond a brook
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
running through it which the state
 
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
stocks with trout you also keep bees for
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%

03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
to keep pheasants for dog training
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
hunting and ultimately table fare
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
our property is less than 400 acres and
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
we are mostly in current use
 
03:24:08.710 --> 03:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to this particular bill
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
primarily because of the language being
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
as vague as it is
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
related to the species that we keep
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
pheasants have been talked quite a bit
 
03:24:22.229 --> 03:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
regarding um this particular bill from
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier
 
03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
folks that discussed it and given that
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
the state releases these birds um on
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
many other land owners land
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
and the fact that these birds are not
 
03:24:36.309 --> 03:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh raised in the wild they're actually
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
raised in captivity you know one could
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
assume that they were domestic
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know we have
 
03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
a business that's open to the public
 
03:24:49.190 --> 03:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're not private like corbyn park
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
as some of the other people test their
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
testimony stated
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
we have many many users of our facility
 
03:24:57.670 --> 03:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of new hampshire
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
and if we were to lose our current youth
 
03:25:00.080 --> 03:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
and if we were to lose our current youth
status

03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know our business would be in
 
03:25:04.950 --> 03:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
jeopardy of going under
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
so based on that you know we certainly
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this particular bill
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from mr keane
 
03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%

ahead of myself a little bit who wants
 
03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%

representative manchurian you do you see
 
03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
him in queue
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
he is in queue and he is unmuted right
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
now mr keane uh do you want to speak in
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill i'll give you
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.469 --> 03:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
he now has his hand up
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
i've recognized him
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
and he needs to unmute himself
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to promote him to panelists
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:25.359 --> 03:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
alright

03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%

think i have figured it out
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
just deep into the pandemic i will be
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
very uh succinct mr chairman and members
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee i'm opposed to hb467 i
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
am a citizen of uh sony new hampshire
 
03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
but i am also the senior vice president
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
and general counsel for the national
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
shooting sports foundation which is the
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
firearms ammunition hunting and shooting
 
03:26:56.710 --> 03:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
sports industries trade association our
 
03:26:58.870 --> 03:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
members include companies such as
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
six-hour ruger and many many firearms
 
03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
six-hour ruger and many many firearms
retailers

03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
retailers
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the united states and
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
including for you far view farms which
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
you just heard from mr rulo
 
03:27:12.870 --> 03:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation is clearly aimed if you
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
pardon upon at corbyn park much of the
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussion has been about issues
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding wild boar escaping from the
 
03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:21.110 align:start position:0%
surrounding wild boar escaping from the
property

03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not really truly
 
03:27:26.710 --> 03:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
address the purported issue it's trying
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
to solve i view this as anti-hunting
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that will hurt
 
03:27:34.630 --> 03:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
shooting preserves like mr rulo's that
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
he just described and reduce access and
 
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity the purpose of the fair use
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
is to promote conservation
 
03:27:45.670 --> 03:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so by doing away with this credit
 
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
you will be hurting conservation because
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
as mr rulo explained he would likely
 
03:27:52.630 --> 03:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
have to go out of business it would also
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
impact animal agriculture such as for
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
example a yankee farmer in warner which
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
raises buffalo for sale
 
03:28:03.269 --> 03:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that is obviously a non-native
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
non-domesticated animal and i would also
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
point out that elk are in fact native to
 
03:28:12.790 --> 03:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire while obviously they are
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
not in any great numbers in the wild
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
they are not a non-native species so
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
incorrect information much of what we
 
03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
heard earlier is simply not factually
 
03:28:23.439 --> 03:28:24.710 align:start position:0%
heard earlier is simply not factually
correct

03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:25.910 align:start position:0%
correct
this

03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to address an issue of wild
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
war it should be taken up by the fish
 
03:28:32.150 --> 03:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
and game commission not by this
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee which will hurt farmers and
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
small game preserves in kennels in
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
hunting dog
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
training locations so i thank you for
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
your time and i ask you to oppose this
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
legislation any members of the committee
 
03:28:47.510 --> 03:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
03:28:49.990 --> 03:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
mr keane
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
seeing that last speaker
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill is donald mcfarland a
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
i am looking mr chair
 
03:29:08.070 --> 03:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:10.389 --> 03:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
he's from orange new hampshire
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
my video should be good
 
03:29:19.990 --> 03:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
mr mcfarland you've asked for three
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
minutes i'd like you to try to get to
 
03:29:36.309 --> 03:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
your points in two
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay i just got rejoined i i missed what
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
you just said mr chairman can you repeat
 
03:29:40.239 --> 03:29:41.349 align:start position:0%
you just said mr chairman can you repeat
that

03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
you've asked for three minutes of speed
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to try to get to your key
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
points in two
 
03:29:48.070 --> 03:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
i will endeavor to do so and i think a
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
number of the points that i wanted to
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
speak on have already been covered so
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
we'll see what i can do
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
um just to
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
cover where we are
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
that i think some of these things have
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
already been discussed uh representative
 
03:30:01.030 --> 03:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
reed indicated that her language is
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
simple and yet she acknowledged up front
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
that she knew that there are clear
 
03:30:07.830 --> 03:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
weaknesses with her wording
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
if we can't find simple language that
 
03:30:11.190 --> 03:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
will suffice i have very little
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
confidence that making the language more
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
complex will make the legal
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
interpretations upon this clearer
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh domestication
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
is by no means a binary of a black or
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
white uh definition it is a continuum
 
03:30:27.269 --> 03:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
and it is a rather subjective one at
 
03:30:27.279 --> 03:30:28.550 align:start position:0%
and it is a rather subjective one at
that

03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:31.190 --> 03:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
we have a number of definitions if you
 
03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
just go and google domestication you can
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
find many for yourself which make it
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
clear how complex uh that definition is
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative manjapuri uh asked about
 
03:30:42.790 --> 03:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
the definition of native versus
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
non-native species of animal
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
i put it to you that you know she is
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
very much right to question what
 
03:30:52.229 --> 03:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
constitutes a native uh and domesticated
 
03:30:52.239 --> 03:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
constitutes a native uh and domesticated
species

03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
species
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh i dare say i qualify as non-native to
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for that matter to the
 
03:30:59.190 --> 03:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
continent although it's not clear from
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the bill are we talking about new
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire or the us or america
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
my wife and i were talking recently
 
03:31:07.349 --> 03:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing some highland cows for our
 
03:31:09.120 --> 03:31:10.150 align:start position:0%
purchasing some highland cows for our
farm

03:31:10.150 --> 03:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
farm
 
03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:10.950 align:start position:0%
farm
and

03:31:10.950 --> 03:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
even although we'd be doing it from
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
stock that was uh grown here in
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
this nation
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh it would not be from this state
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
and it would not be any that have as
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
provenanced and historical a
 
03:31:27.190 --> 03:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
relationship to new hampshire as the new
 
03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire elk uh and wild boar uh in
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
corbyn park
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh and from time to time for that matter
 
03:31:34.630 --> 03:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
my wife has suggested that i may not be
 
03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
wholly domesticated so should my farm
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
and forest land be removed from current
 
03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
use because of myself
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's absurd and and i think we've
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
addressed that but i think as you look
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
as a committee at changing the language
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
which clearly you would need to do if
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
this were to be passed i suspect that
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
there is very little language that you
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
might find that would not have other
 
03:31:56.790 --> 03:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
issues as well
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of current use i think mr
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
mason addressed fairly well so i won't
 
03:32:06.389 --> 03:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
spend much time on that
 
03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
other than to say that
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
the the question that was first posed by
 
03:32:13.349 --> 03:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative trelevan and a good deal
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
of the additional commentary that
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
followed there from
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
seems to imply
 
03:32:20.070 --> 03:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
that current use is about having the
 
03:32:21.910 --> 03:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
land be open to the general public it is
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
about what are we getting from it that
 
03:32:26.229 --> 03:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
we're not getting anything from it was
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
discussed several times
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
that was never the intent
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
nor the stated purpose
 
03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
of the current use laws as as and when
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
they were enacted or as and when they've
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
been revisited and modified many times
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
we the people of new hampshire
 
03:32:44.950 --> 03:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
just as i decided when we passed rsa 79a
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
that it was in our interest to tell
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
people precisely what and what not to do
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
with their land no i don't think so what
 
03:32:53.190 --> 03:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
in fact happened was that we determined
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
it was in the public interest to
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
encourage the preservation of open space
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and if you read the statute you will see
 
03:32:59.670 --> 03:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
that stated very clearly there better
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
than i can do it right now
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
26 000 acres of open space with a
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
handful of structures on it and with
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
careful and well-funded management of
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
the flora and fauna thereon is precisely
 
03:33:10.630 --> 03:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
the sort of purpose that was
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
contemplated when we passed the current
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
use laws here in this state
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
our current use laws were instrumental
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
in my making a decision
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
to move to new hampshire and to choose
 
03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
this as the state i wanted to live in
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
and grow my family in and to earn wages
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
and pay taxes
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
both property taxes and other taxes
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
within this great state this is a
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
slippery slope
 
03:33:35.349 --> 03:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
and i'll move to the next point that i
 
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make which is about the
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
i i read this bill
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
last night by happen chance because i
 
03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
planned to come today
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately not in person to state
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
house but but to testify on another
 
03:33:50.239 --> 03:33:51.349 align:start position:0%
house but but to testify on another
matter

03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
matter
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i was horrified to see this
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
because it struck me
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
when i first read it as an attack
 
03:33:59.190 --> 03:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
against corbyn park
 
03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
if you wish to attack the blue mountain
 
03:34:03.190 --> 03:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
forest association and you point out
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
that they are already recognized
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
explicitly by name in existing statutes
 
03:34:10.950 --> 03:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh existing rsas
 
03:34:13.030 --> 03:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
then call them out by name
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative reed made no bones about
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
it this was her intent
 
03:34:19.269 --> 03:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
to go after corbyn park
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
and she's not too worried about the fact
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
that there's maybe one other
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
in her view uh
 
03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
club or park or whatever that
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
could be included as well
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
if that's your intent
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
then put it in the bill
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and if it was a bill that said so if it
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
was a bill that said this is about going
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
after corbyn park
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
i would regard that as obscene overreach
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
were this a socialist state i should not
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
be surprised to see such spitefulness
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
against citizens who have done well
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
themselves and attain some other measure
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
of wealth and enjoyment
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
that was a significant reason for my
 
03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
emigrating from the united kingdom
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
and coming to this fair land and i'm
 
03:34:58.720 --> 03:34:59.830 align:start position:0%
and coming to this fair land and i'm
appalled

03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
appalled
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
to see
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
what has been done here by the sponsors
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill and those who would support
 
03:35:04.960 --> 03:35:06.150 align:start position:0%
of this bill and those who would support
it

03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
they i have two small points left that i
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
i will wrap up as soon as i can mr
 
03:35:10.239 --> 03:35:11.429 align:start position:0%
i will wrap up as soon as i can mr
chairman

03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:35:13.269 --> 03:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
the first is
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
that this is not
 
03:35:16.229 --> 03:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
a novelty
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
we have had many prior bills
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
intended to attack corbyn park
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
a number of of recent bills even we had
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
a bill just last year
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
that attempted to impose a safari
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
hunting license house bill 1573.
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to make an argument
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we're not getting enough funds in
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
to take account of wild boars that
 
03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
to take account of wild boars that
escape

03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
escape
 
03:35:41.429 --> 03:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
and which frankly are quite
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily hunted by the neighbors
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
of that park today without incurring
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
substantial costs but nevertheless if we
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
believe there are costs there to address
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
then at least house bill 1573 addressed
 
03:35:53.279 --> 03:35:53.990 align:start position:0%
then at least house bill 1573 addressed
it

03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
by bringing funds in for the fish and
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
game department
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
it didn't attempt to say
 
03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
let's assume that that corbyn park is
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
about growing school children
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
and growing residential waste
 
03:36:08.309 --> 03:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
and requiring snow plowing of their
 
03:36:08.319 --> 03:36:09.670 align:start position:0%
and requiring snow plowing of their
property

03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
and requires huge increases in local
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
taxation for them
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
the the purposes here are not even
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
slightly aligned
 
03:36:19.110 --> 03:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
the final point that i will make
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
is about the fiscal impact and i note
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
that there was no fiscal note on this
 
03:36:23.279 --> 03:36:25.269 align:start position:0%
that there was no fiscal note on this
bill

03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
will we add a fiscal note to reflect the
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
likelihood of litigation
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
and to reflect the possible need to
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
compensate people for this what amounts
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
to a taking
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
of of land
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
and of enjoyment
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
i've never set foot in corbyn park
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
and yet it gives me great satisfaction
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
to know that those 26 000 acres of open
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
space have been and are being preserved
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
with well-funded management practices
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
and to know that we have a place in new
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire where we allow the majestic
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
and i might add tasty new hampshire elk
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
and wild boar to rome
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill thank you
 
03:37:11.349 --> 03:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr parliament
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%

03:37:17.030 --> 03:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
state where you're from and whether you
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
support or oppose the film
 
03:37:23.349 --> 03:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
hi my name is nancy holmes i did sign in
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the bill i've been
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
listening along to all the testimony i'm
 
03:37:30.309 --> 03:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
here from new boston today i'm not a
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
hunter i am in favor of keeping as much
 
03:37:35.190 --> 03:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
land in new hampshire open as possible
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
because i love it
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
um but i want to correct a couple of
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
things that i've heard stated as facts
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
which i'm pretty sure are not facts
 
03:37:46.229 --> 03:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
you've all heard plenty about how the
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
fact that current use is not a synonym
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
for public access so you know that
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
but another statement that was made is
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
that the buffalo that are sitting on our
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
farmers lands in this state are
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
domesticated tame animals they are not
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
just because an animal is being kept in
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
captivity that does not make it tame
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
if keeping it in captivity did make it
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
tame that would mean all the animals on
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
corbin park would of course be
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
domesticated animals
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's exactly what
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
anybody means to say
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
um the akc hunt clubs are another big
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
group that are going to be impacted if
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
this bill goes through
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
and this is not a bunch of rich people
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
coming in from out of state this is all
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
your local guys who want to train their
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
dogs and excuse me your local ladies too
 
03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
because i know several ladies who do
 
03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:38.710 align:start position:0%
because i know several ladies who do
um

03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
corbin park has been in place since 1890
 
03:38:43.030 --> 03:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
as far as i can tell
 
03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:43.990 align:start position:0%
as far as i can tell
um

03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
and that means for 130 so years
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
this park has been in place without any
 
03:38:53.349 --> 03:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
devastating impact on the environment i
 
03:38:56.070 --> 03:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
do believe that the instance where
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sorry i'm old for me they
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
were russian wild boar not eurasian
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
but um the russian wild boar i believe
 
03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
their escape and uh as breeding colony
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
into new southwestern new hampshire came
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
about during a hurricane in the 1930s
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so this is there may be some newer
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
escapes that i just haven't heard about
 
03:39:20.389 --> 03:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
in the paper but there is a situation in
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
the southwestern part of the state where
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
there are uh wild boar reproducing as
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
far as i know not on the game preserve
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
and have been for a long time that would
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
mean that everybody whose land they are
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
on would suddenly use current lose
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
current use under this bill so the
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
people who farm emus ostriches buffalo
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
red deer
 
03:39:42.319 --> 03:39:43.190 align:start position:0%
red deer
um

03:39:43.190 --> 03:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
and the way it's written is so vague
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
that it would include the people who are
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
raising hedgehogs and um sawford african
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
rats that they breed for use in feeding
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
snakes and oh god help the poor people
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
who are raising boa constrictors
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is really bad i really believe
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
it needs to be itl
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
when i looked at this bill
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and after listening to all everybody
 
03:40:12.870 --> 03:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
today what i came down to is this is
 
03:40:12.880 --> 03:40:14.229 align:start position:0%
today what i came down to is this is
that

03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
this park probably
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
uses local food for animals and people
 
03:40:23.670 --> 03:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's a tourism destination
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
a non-producing
 
03:40:29.590 --> 03:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
area in
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:40:32.710 --> 03:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
and what i'm hearing from the sponsors
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
of people who are for this bill is how
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
dare those rich people be invited into
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%

03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%

03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
what they choose to do as a tourist
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
which is hunting on a private preserve
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%

04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as a spreadsheet of
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the payment history of this program so
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
today i'm sure you'll appreciate that i
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
will just go over the main points
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income homeowners
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program
 
04:20:37.429 --> 04:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
is intended to help low-income people
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
many of whom are senior citizens remain
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
in their homes
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
but the program is in danger of
 
04:20:43.760 --> 04:20:45.510 align:start position:0%
but the program is in danger of
disappearing

04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
disappearing
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
in the first year of the program which
 
04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
was 18 years ago
 
04:20:50.560 --> 04:20:51.990 align:start position:0%
was 18 years ago
10

04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire homeowners applied and
 
04:20:59.110 --> 04:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
received a total of 7.5 million dollars
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
in rebates
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
since then participation has slowly
 
04:21:04.080 --> 04:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
since then participation has slowly
decreased

04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
just 1.5
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
percent 1.5 received a total of less
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
than 1 million dollars
 
04:21:16.000 --> 04:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
than 1 million dollars
so

04:21:17.110 --> 04:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for this decline in
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
participation is the shrinking side
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
size of the rebate amount
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the beginning the maximum rebate was
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
almost 500
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
and that was that was 18 years ago
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
last year the maximum rebate was 183
 
04:21:39.040 --> 04:21:40.309 align:start position:0%
last year the maximum rebate was 183
dollars

04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
and this year it will drop to about
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
160 dollars
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
and those amounts i i'll remind you are
 
04:21:54.070 --> 04:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
just for the very lowest income level
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
other people that do qualify would
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
receive only 60 40 or 20 of that maximum
 
04:22:03.910 --> 04:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
amount so 20
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
of 60 160 is only 32
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
so you can understand why maybe some
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
people are not applying for it anymore
 
04:22:17.110 --> 04:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
participation has also dropped because
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
fewer people
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
now have incomes that fall below the
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
the only people who get the maximum rema
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
rates now are single homeowners
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
with an adjusted annual gross income
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
below 12 500
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
or a two people or more
 
04:22:45.110 --> 04:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh household with the income below 25
 
04:22:45.120 --> 04:22:47.030 align:start position:0%
uh household with the income below 25
000.

04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
000.
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
so participation and rebate amounts will
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
continue to drop
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
unless we raise those income limits
 
04:22:56.319 --> 04:22:57.429 align:start position:0%
unless we raise those income limits
and

04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
the property cap value that is in the
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
build right now it's set at a hundred
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of property value for
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the rebate
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill will increase the maximum
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
rebate to about
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
350 dollars for next year and make more
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
people eligible
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
so i ask that you please help low income
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
people particularly the seniors remain
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
with this bill they can once again get a
 
04:23:28.239 --> 04:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
with this bill they can once again get a
meaningful

04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
property tax relief
 
04:23:35.110 --> 04:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
in the form of a rebate on their
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax bill
 
04:23:38.239 --> 04:23:39.030 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax bill
so

04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
i can take any of your questions i would
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%

representative porter that's uh correct
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the i
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
both last time it wasn't last year it
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
was actually two years ago
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
but um what i did in both cases is i
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
used census data
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
to compare to the original program back
 
04:24:43.600 --> 04:24:44.710 align:start position:0%
to compare to the original program back
in

04:24:44.710 --> 04:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:24:44.720 --> 04:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
in
2002

04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
2002
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
and updated them
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
based on that and i did the same process
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
again so it's the same bill as two years
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
ago although the caps in the amounts are
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative fellows for taking my
 
04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:08.149 align:start position:0%
representative fellows for taking my
question

04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
how does this reflect our census data in
 
04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
terms of new hampshire
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
aging population what was the census
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
in 2002
 
04:25:22.309 --> 04:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
and now we in the last few years we have
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
become number two or number three in the
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
aging population in the country isn't it
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative
 
04:25:33.750 --> 04:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
the i can't answer that question about
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
the senior population although with it
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
with a with a specific um number for you
 
04:25:42.070 --> 04:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
but i do know that that is indeed the
 
04:25:44.469 --> 04:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
case because we hear repeatedly on the
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
news that
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has either the highest or
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
the second highest percentage of senior
 
04:25:51.600 --> 04:25:52.950 align:start position:0%
the second highest percentage of senior
citizens

04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
the actual census data that i used
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
is broken down by
 
04:26:01.750 --> 04:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
income category
 
04:26:01.760 --> 04:26:02.710 align:start position:0%
income category
so

04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
i used to do the update
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes go ahead and
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um this also
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
shows that
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
properties taxes being the prime
 
04:26:20.229 --> 04:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
revenue for our state
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
this is a push and pull in terms of
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
do we raise you know we are raising the
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
property tax but not getting the rebates
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
so that burden shift has happened isn't
 
04:26:32.479 --> 04:26:33.349 align:start position:0%
so that burden shift has happened isn't
that

04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:33.359 --> 04:26:35.349 align:start position:0%
that
true

04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative um
 
04:26:42.149 --> 04:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that that is going on in
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
terms of property tax as a whole
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
this particular bill though
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
deals only with the statewide education
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that's been on tax bills for almost
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
20 years now the amount
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
let me put it this way the rate of that
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
tax has gone down over the 20 years
 
04:27:06.800 --> 04:27:08.229 align:start position:0%
tax has gone down over the 20 years
but

04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:27:08.239 --> 04:27:09.110 align:start position:0%
but
the

04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
prop the property values have gone up
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
so when you have
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
the same rate
 
04:27:16.880 --> 04:27:17.910 align:start position:0%
the same rate
and

04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
property values go up then the tax bill
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
increases when you have the rate going
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
down and the property values
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
going up
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
in proportion what you end up is the tax
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill is actually about the same
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
so the statewide education property tax
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
bills that people are getting
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
now are about the same as they were 20
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
years ago assuming you have you know the
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
same home and all that
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons this rebate is going
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
down is because the home that was worth
 
04:27:57.040 --> 04:27:59.030 align:start position:0%
down is because the home that was worth
um

04:27:59.030 --> 04:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
100 000 let's suppose somebody had a
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
homework worth a hundred thousand
 
04:28:03.359 --> 04:28:04.469 align:start position:0%
homework worth a hundred thousand
dollars

04:28:04.469 --> 04:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
20 years ago now it's worth um
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
but they're only getting the rebate on
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
half the property value and half of what
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
they paid in instead of getting the
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
whole amount that they were
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay next
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
question we have is
 
04:28:28.239 --> 04:28:36.389 align:start position:0%
question we have is
representative

04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.870 --> 04:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative fellows for
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
answering our questions so
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is kind of
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
new to me i didn't
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
so this is a program that isn't a buy-in
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
from the towns this is actually
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
a program with this with the state is
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative that's correct
 
04:29:01.680 --> 04:29:02.469 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative that's correct
um

04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
this has
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with local
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
property rates or
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
taxes aside from the fact that it
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
appears on your property tax bill
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is a tax
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
04:29:19.510 --> 04:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
and the program started 20 years ago at
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
04:29:24.159 --> 04:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
the same time
that

04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
in response to the claremont lawsuit
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
this was back when governor shaheen was
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
governor in response to that lawsuit
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:29:40.149 --> 04:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
use a property tax to show a bigger
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
share of state contribution to funding
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
education so that's when it appeared on
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
the property tax bills
 
04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
and what what happens with that um
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
money is
 
04:29:56.560 --> 04:29:57.349 align:start position:0%
money is
the

04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:57.359 --> 04:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
the
local

04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:30:00.389 --> 04:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
town clerk's
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
tax collectors collect that money and
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
they send it over to the school
 
04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
districts and that becomes part of the
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid money that
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
is booked as being from the state
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%

system new hampshire uses to fund its
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
to build awareness of the shortcomings
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
of that system
 
04:31:09.750 --> 04:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
and to advocate for changes in law that
 
04:31:11.110 --> 04:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
make that system
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
more equitable for students and
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayers alike
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
as house bill 486 would make real
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
progress in improving taxpayer equity we
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill and urge the
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend it as ought to
 
04:31:22.159 --> 04:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend it as ought to
pass

04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
as members of this committee are aware
 
04:31:27.189 --> 04:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
one can't discuss new hampshire's tax
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
system without talking about the
 
04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
property tax it's far and away the
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
largest tax collected in new hampshire
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
generating close to four billion dollars
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
to support state and local public
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
services in 2019 um
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
yet that property tax is also an unfair
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
tax as it pays places a far greater
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility on low and moderate
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
income taxpayers than it does on more
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
affluent ones uh the latest data that we
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
have from the institute on taxation
 
04:31:52.870 --> 04:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
economic policy
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
suggests that the poorest twenty percent
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire households those are
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
households with incomes under
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
twenty six thousand seven hundred
 
04:31:59.760 --> 04:32:00.790 align:start position:0%
twenty six thousand seven hundred
dollars

04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
paid roughly six point two percent of
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
their incomes in property taxes in 2018.
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
stark contrast the wealthiest one
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
percent of households each of which had
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
an income in excess of
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
514 000
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
paid an effective property tax rate of
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
just 1.9 percent
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
now despite new hampshire's heavy
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
reliance on the property tax and in turn
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
that tax is heavy toll on the lease well
 
04:32:22.720 --> 04:32:23.590 align:start position:0%
that tax is heavy toll on the lease well
off

04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
the state does very little to mitigate
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
the impact of the tax on those
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
struggling to make ends meet
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
as representative fellows has already
 
04:32:30.399 --> 04:32:31.429 align:start position:0%
as representative fellows has already
discussed

04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
the state's principal approach to
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
property tax relief the lower moderate
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
income homeowners property tax relief
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
program that's the subject of this bill
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
has all been evaporated in recent years
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
and she provided very detailed
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
information about that so i don't want
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
to belabor that point
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
and as she also discussed
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
the bill before you would seek to
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
reverse that trend and to aid new
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh homeowners facing financial
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
hardship both by expanding the number of
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who could take part and the
 
04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
value of the rebates that would they
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
in bolstering property tax relief house
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill 486 is consistent with one of the
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
key recommendations
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
offered by the recent commission to
 
04:33:11.670 --> 04:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
study school funding as members of this
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee may know that commission met
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
for much of last year despite the
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic and received hours of input
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
from school finance officials
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
tax administrators academic experts and
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
they examine new hampshire's school
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
property tax system at length
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
and after doing so they recommended that
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
among other changes and i just want to
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
quote from the report
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
the state should enhance taxpayer equity
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
through property tax relief targeted to
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
homeowners and renters through a low and
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
 
04:33:38.799 --> 04:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
program

04:33:39.750 --> 04:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
this program should include should
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
include updated limits to income home
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
value and net worth and be
 
04:33:48.150 --> 04:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily funded by the state
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
and one final point i'd like to offer is
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
that at the present time the house
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
representatives is actively considering
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
changes in tax law intended to spur
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
economic growth and ease the difficult
 
04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
economic situations many families now
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
face through the pandemic
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
any effort to use new hampshire's tax
 
04:34:05.269 --> 04:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
system to achieve those ends should
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
start with property tax relief efforts
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
along the lines of house bill 486 house
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill 486 would put money in the pockets
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
of granite staters still coping with the
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
economic consequences of the pandemic
 
04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
and thus allowed them to shop and spend
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
at local businesses striving to remain
 
04:34:19.840 --> 04:34:20.709 align:start position:0%
at local businesses striving to remain
open

04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i once again urge the
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend house bill 486 as
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
on to pass and i look forward to working
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
with the members of committee to make
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's tax system more fair for
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
everyone i'd be happy to answer any
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
questions you might have you know
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
florida do you have a question
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes i do mr chair thank you and thank
 
04:34:39.189 --> 04:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
you um mr mclink for taking my question
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
am i correct in saying that when a
 
04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer applies for this rebate
 
04:34:49.590 --> 04:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
it is not taken from the town's coffers
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
in any way nor does it impact
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
the um funding that school systems get
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
am i correct that's absolutely correct
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
um to i believe another rep's point
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
earlier about whether cities and towns
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
opt in they don't this is universally
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
available for anybody
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
with income below certain levels it's
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
available not just to elderly homeowners
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
but to um you know younger ones as well
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
should their incomes be sufficiently low
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't in any way figure into
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
the calculation of aid that they
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh that those cities and towns receive
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
for school funding
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
while the funds come out of
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
that that trust fund as you know is
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
always made whole if needed
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
by the general fund
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
increasing the limits so that people get
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
higher rebates is not going to have an
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
effect on the budget for the
 
04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
hillsborough deering school system or my
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
or my local property taxes that's
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and if i could expand
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
on a sort of discussion that was offered
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
earlier um while this is tied to the
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
statewide property tax
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
that tax has
 
04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
um over time played a smaller and
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
smaller role
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
in funding
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
schools and so there's every reason to
 
04:36:09.439 --> 04:36:10.470 align:start position:0%
schools and so there's every reason to
increase

04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
this relief because much of the job that
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
that tax was doing is now being
 
04:36:18.070 --> 04:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
pushed down onto localities and so
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
relief really does need to be expanded
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you there are a couple
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
of hands raised but uh i was considering
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
taking this to an immediate executive
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify that the
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
process to get the rebate is that the
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
the homeowner pays the tax bill to the
 
04:36:52.719 --> 04:36:53.670 align:start position:0%
the homeowner pays the tax bill to the
town

04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
and then sends a form to revenue
 
04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
administration and revenue
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
administration sends them a check
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
you want to make an additional comment
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair uh this is to
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
either representative fellows or i
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
didn't quite get the name of nhs
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
ffp person
 
04:37:16.561 --> 04:37:17.750 align:start position:0%
ffp person
um

04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
my question is that property tax is
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
collected in two parts right one is at
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
and one at the county
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
level so this is the state's portion of
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
it that pays towards the education
 
04:37:33.119 --> 04:37:34.310 align:start position:0%
it that pays towards the education
funding

04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:37:34.320 --> 04:37:35.189 align:start position:0%
funding
so

04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:35.199 --> 04:37:36.230 align:start position:0%
so
this

04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
clearly shows
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
or at least in my
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
pushing the
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
responsibility and
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh expense to the
 
04:37:47.199 --> 04:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
uh expense to the
local

04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
and not providing that relief at the
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
state level am i making sense
 
04:37:53.600 --> 04:37:54.869 align:start position:0%
state level am i making sense
no

04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
i yes yes um representative benjamin if
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
if you look at a tax bill
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
there will be a line for the municipal
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
tax for the town or the city tax there
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
will be one line for the state um
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
education property tax and another line
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
for the county tax and then sometimes
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are different like you know
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
like water districts or something on
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
there also
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
so they're all separate they're on all
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
on the tax bill and you pay them all at
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%

04:44:58.708 --> 04:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit municipal
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
welfare or basically prohibit cities in
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
town from establishing
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
rules that require an inspection
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
as a stipulation for disbursing
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
emergency housing assistance funds
 
04:45:13.110 --> 04:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire as the committee knows
 
04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
statewide requires municipalities to
 
04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
provide for
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
their residents
 
04:45:20.788 --> 04:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
who are indigent
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
this is set up as sort of the last line
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
of support for people who have exhausted
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
other needs of assistance
 
04:45:30.788 --> 04:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
this bill would uh or the law also
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
requires municipalities to enact
 
04:45:35.910 --> 04:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines for providing that support
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
in some communities one of these
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines is a requirement that
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
dwellings be respected for code
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
compliance prior to providing housing
 
04:45:44.480 --> 04:45:45.910 align:start position:0%
compliance prior to providing housing
assistance

04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
is reasonable it's to ensure that this
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
but landlords are under no obligation to
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
allow this inspection so as you can
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
imagine they could lead to people who
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
would qualify for assistance being
 
04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
evicted from their homes because the
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh and people who
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh essentially people would be evicted
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
who might otherwise be
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh who would otherwise be able to stay
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
the committee has heard a number of
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
bills this term already highlighting the
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
seriousness of the state affordable
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
housing crisis so i don't repeat that
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
um but the challenge in finding suitable
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
housing is more difficult after eviction
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
and this bill is intended to keep people
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
have homes in them during a time of
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
severe housing shortage in our state
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
finally mr chairman i would acknowledge
 
04:46:41.200 --> 04:46:42.628 align:start position:0%
finally mr chairman i would acknowledge
that

04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:44.310 --> 04:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is of course a unique time in our
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
state in our country there's
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
unprecedented federal support for
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
tenants this money is making itself
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
available in our state this is a good
 
04:46:53.680 --> 04:46:54.868 align:start position:0%
available in our state this is a good
thing

04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:46:56.788 --> 04:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is separate from that process
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
this is really intended to address
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
an ongoing concern not a concern that
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily is tied to the coverage
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
take questions and i ask to support
 
04:47:09.680 --> 04:47:10.948 align:start position:0%
take questions and i ask to support
passage

04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
passage
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay so questions from representative
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
conway we have uh representatives davis
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
with her hand up
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
representative conley for taking my
 
04:47:20.718 --> 04:47:21.990 align:start position:0%
representative conley for taking my
question

04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:47:22.000 --> 04:47:24.550 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
i was going to offer an amendment or
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to this bill that
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
would have added the word temporary be
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
before emergency housing assistance
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
but listening to your
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm thinking now that it may
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate
 
04:47:45.910 --> 04:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
um to say something about the fact that
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is these are emergency housing
 
04:47:48.160 --> 04:47:49.510 align:start position:0%
this is these are emergency housing
funds

04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
that are being
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
supplied not in fact emergency
 
04:47:57.910 --> 04:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
housing and i'm asking this question as
 
04:47:57.920 --> 04:47:58.628 align:start position:0%
housing and i'm asking this question as
the

04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair of the board of a large
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
social services non-profit here in the
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
upper valley we do a lot of housing
 
04:48:05.200 --> 04:48:06.628 align:start position:0%
upper valley we do a lot of housing
assistance

04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:48:06.638 --> 04:48:07.590 align:start position:0%
assistance
and

04:48:07.590 --> 04:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
we have several different kinds of
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
housing assistance programs
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
none of them actually provide physical
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
housing they provide funding for people
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
to obtain physical housing so i guess my
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:48:25.990 --> 04:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
what exactly is the emergency housing
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you let me uh
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
try to answer that so
 
04:48:35.920 --> 04:48:36.708 align:start position:0%
try to answer that so
uh

04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:36.718 --> 04:48:37.590 align:start position:0%
uh
in

04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the welfare office of a city or town
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
will often step in as sort of the last
 
04:48:46.150 --> 04:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
me sort of the
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
with nowhere else to go that's where you
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
can you can attempt to find some
 
04:48:49.760 --> 04:48:50.788 align:start position:0%
can you can attempt to find some
assistance

04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:48:50.798 --> 04:48:51.670 align:start position:0%
assistance
um

04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
and as i noted uh and i was out of
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
breath rushing up here so forgive me but
 
04:48:55.680 --> 04:48:58.230 align:start position:0%
breath rushing up here so forgive me but
um

04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose is
 
04:49:02.550 --> 04:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
there are this there's a hurdle in place
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
in some communities that prevents that
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
funding from being dispersed so
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
this is solely about cities and towns
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the municipal welfare assistance
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
um if i didn't answer that or if i
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question please
 
04:49:18.310 --> 04:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
please let me know and i'll try again
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
now um
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes please thank you
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
now representative conley that that
 
04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
definitely does answer my question
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
give this bill the best chance of
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
success do you think that it would be
 
04:49:36.878 --> 04:49:38.230 align:start position:0%
success do you think that it would be
wise

04:49:38.230 --> 04:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
wise
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
to specify that these are emergency
 
04:49:40.560 --> 04:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
to specify that these are emergency
assistance

04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:49:44.550 --> 04:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
and housing emergency assistance funds
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
and not in fact physical places did you
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
see the difference
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative i did not catch that
 
04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
error in the bill i appreciate you for
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
pointing you know pointing it out and i
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
if it's i trust your um
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
i trust that you've identified something
 
04:50:04.150 --> 04:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
that needs addressing so i would i would
 
04:50:06.150 --> 04:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
support that that sounds fine
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:09.270 --> 04:50:09.280 align:start position:0%

confused too if i'm understanding
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
correctly somebody is living in an
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
apartment or a home
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
and they experience hard times
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
and they go to
 
04:50:26.550 --> 04:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
their town welfare office and ask for
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
financial assistance to pay their rent
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would prevent then the town
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
from saying we have to inspect the
 
04:50:36.788 --> 04:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
premises first before we give you the
 
04:50:36.798 --> 04:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
premises first before we give you the
money

04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
precisely and
 
04:50:39.920 --> 04:50:41.110 align:start position:0%
precisely and
okay

04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:41.120 --> 04:50:41.910 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.190 --> 04:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative ninja booty
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:50:50.550 --> 04:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative connolly for taking my
 
04:50:50.560 --> 04:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
representative connolly for taking my
question

04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
does this
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
bill does not differentiate between a
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
renter or a homeowner if i'm a homeowner
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
i can't afford
 
04:51:02.878 --> 04:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
i can't afford
to

04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
code specific
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
changes but my tenant is unable to
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
stay there so would it would help either
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i presume it could help either
 
04:51:21.680 --> 04:51:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i presume it could help either
way

04:51:22.390 --> 04:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
from understanding what you're saying
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
that that as a hormone i mean the owner
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:51:32.470 --> 04:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
rental unit that's falling apart but i
 
04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
can't fix it
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
but i could make sure that so the
 
04:51:37.920 --> 04:51:39.110 align:start position:0%
but i could make sure that so the
renter

04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
renter
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
tenant cannot be kicked out because it's
 
04:51:42.550 --> 04:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
not code specific
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
because of my
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
undue diligence or i'm not able to
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
that scenario is a little bit different
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
than what's envisioned as a as a remedy
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill although the property
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
owner qualified
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
under the existing terms of that
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
particular town welfare
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
program then presumably yes
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
question from representative fleet
 
04:52:15.750 --> 04:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative conway for taking my
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
question uh i think it kind of
 
04:52:21.030 --> 04:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
piggybacks on what uh representative
 
04:52:23.190 --> 04:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
stavis had asked as well as
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
this is um emergency funds for a place
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
that i currently live in but can't pay
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
rent it's not the same thing as if
 
04:52:37.990 --> 04:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
if you had a fire within the apartment
 
04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
and we had to displace um the residents
 
04:52:41.200 --> 04:52:42.070 align:start position:0%
and we had to displace um the residents
there

04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:52:44.550 --> 04:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
and someone offered up
 
04:52:44.560 --> 04:52:47.270 align:start position:0%
and someone offered up
housing

04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
i i guess what i'm saying is like what
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
happened in in manchester when they
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
tried to open up their police department
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
but they needed to have it inspected um
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
they opened up emergency housing but it
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't get inspected in time so this
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
would not qualify for that this would
 
04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
just be qualified for someone who's
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
already in a place is that correct
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes again so uh to use a scenario if um
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's somebody approaches the
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
municipality for welfare assistance they
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
meet the income requirements and all
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
else uh everything is ready to move
 
04:53:21.430 --> 04:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
forward but for this inspection which
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
the landlord is under no obligation to
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
allow the inspection to take place
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
under that scenario the tenant could
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely be evicted
 
04:53:33.990 --> 04:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
despite the availability of support that
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay next question
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.270 --> 04:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative blind thank you for
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
coming to my question um
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
how does this deal with any possible
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
some standard housing that might be
 
04:53:57.040 --> 04:53:57.990 align:start position:0%
some standard housing that might be
available

04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
not as a town protected about giving
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
funds for substandard housing we're
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with people are kind of in
 
04:54:04.390 --> 04:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
crisis and that's why i put them in a
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
bad situation potentially yeah that's
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's
 
04:54:07.520 --> 04:54:08.868 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's
definitely

04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
we've thought that we i and others i've
 
04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
worked with on this bill have really
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
been torn on that question because uh
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely a problem in our state
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a concern this really comes
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
down to
 
04:54:19.280 --> 04:54:19.990 align:start position:0%
down to
a

04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
value judgment that some housing is
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
better than no housing this kind of
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
housing crisis time
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the fact that tenants under you know
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
any time whether or not they're up
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
against an eviction or not could pursue
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
a code complaint against their
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.280 --> 04:54:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:41.120 --> 04:54:42.868 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:54:42.878 --> 04:54:52.868 align:start position:0%
yeah
representative

04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:55.030 --> 04:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
something like that i would hate to have
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
that okay for somebody to go in there
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
and live there without being inspected
 
04:55:04.708 --> 04:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank everybody
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'd share that concern i would also
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the unit are what the
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
tenant has been living in presumably for
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
some time that has led up to this crisis
 
04:55:17.280 --> 04:55:18.150 align:start position:0%
some time that has led up to this crisis
and

04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:18.160 --> 04:55:21.270 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh with the the birth of options for
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
people the lack of affordable housing
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
alternatives again it's it's a judgment
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
that that i that i'm putting out that
 
04:55:32.550 --> 04:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
others may not agree with but that some
 
04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.360 --> 04:55:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
next speaker we have is
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
the support of the bill
 
04:55:44.080 --> 04:55:45.350 align:start position:0%

04:56:26.310 --> 04:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
decent affordable housing
 
04:56:28.390 --> 04:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
and in a normal housing market i
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support anything like this
 
04:56:32.868 --> 04:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
but we're not in the normal housing
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
market the median income for a
 
04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment statewide is one
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred and thirteen
 
04:56:42.550 --> 04:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
dollars a month the vacancy rate
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
statewide is one point eight percent
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
so if you apply you realize what a
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
a market like this causes
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
for low and moderate income people in
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
search of housing um you take another
 
04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
i've had to take another look at this
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
local welfare recipients are generally
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
the poorest people in a municipality the
 
04:57:08.230 --> 04:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
statute says you have to be poor and
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
unable to support yourself
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
by far the biggest line item
 
04:57:17.590 --> 04:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
for most local welfare offices is rent
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing more
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
important to relief and maintenance than
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
is housing
 
04:57:26.550 --> 04:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
these people who go to local welfare who
 
04:57:29.030 --> 04:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
are the poorest in the municipality
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
generally live in poor housing because
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's all they can afford
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
um so what happens when they fall behind
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
in rent they go to the local welfare
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
department found eligible in some and
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
not all municipalities do this but some
 
04:57:44.480 --> 04:57:45.590 align:start position:0%
not all municipalities do this but some
do

04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're eligible
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
conditioned upon an inspection
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
and passing the inspection
 
04:57:54.550 --> 04:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
but many landlords don't cooperate with
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
the inspection or won't make the repairs
 
04:57:59.590 --> 04:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
that are required
 
04:58:02.230 --> 04:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
therefore the town doesn't assist
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
the tenant can't pay
 
04:58:06.070 --> 04:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
the tenant gets evicted
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
and not only is the tenant poor and
 
04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
unable to pay those very high rents all
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
over the place but now he or she has an
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
eviction on a record making it even more
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
unlikely that they can find any decent
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
place to stay and the result is too
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
often that they become homeless
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
most inspections in
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
in most cities and towns are based on
 
04:58:31.750 --> 04:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that the tenant
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
made a complaint
 
04:58:33.760 --> 04:58:34.948 align:start position:0%
made a complaint
um

04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's up to the tenant to complain and i
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
think it's totally consistent with new
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire values to let the tenant be
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
the one to come make the complaint and
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
then if they do of course the housing
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
code department can do
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
and order repairs you know that are
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate under the housing code
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
but shouldn't a tenant who applies for
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
local welfare have the fair same choice
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
of whether or not to complain as any
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
other tenant
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities under this bill can still
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
re respond to tenant complaints or
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
neighbor complaints anytime
 
04:59:15.190 --> 04:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
or a city is free to adopt with the
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
college certificate of compliance
 
04:59:17.200 --> 04:59:18.310 align:start position:0%
college certificate of compliance
program

04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:59:18.320 --> 04:59:19.190 align:start position:0%
program
where

04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
every s every few years
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
on a staggered basis each rental unit is
 
04:59:25.280 --> 04:59:26.550 align:start position:0%
on a staggered basis each rental unit is
um

04:59:26.550 --> 04:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:26.560 --> 04:59:28.070 align:start position:0%
um
inspected

04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
to and get a certificate of compliance
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
if it meets code standards
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly the municipalities that do
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
impose a requirement
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
that there be an inspection prior to
 
04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
granting local welfare assistance
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
is well intended
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
but it should not in practice become a
 
04:59:49.520 --> 04:59:50.708 align:start position:0%
but it should not in practice become a
punishment

04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
for a local welfare applicant
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
um who's seeking rental assistance when
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
the choice again when the choice is
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
substandard housing or no housing at all
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
regrettably terribly regrettably
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
i think we have to choose some housing
 
05:00:08.798 --> 05:00:10.150 align:start position:0%
i think we have to choose some housing
and

05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
i heard your passage of the bill
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
let me say if i could that in response i
 
05:00:18.628 --> 05:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
think it was representative davis to
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
indicate that we're talking about funds
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
not actual housing i think if we added
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
the phrase
 
05:00:29.670 --> 05:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
um pursuant to rsa chapter 165
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
to paragraph two of the bill so it would
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
read no municipality shall require a
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
housing code inspection as a condition
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
of emergency housing assistance granted
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa chapter 165. under rsa
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
chapter 165 all assistance is by voucher
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's a promise to pay from the city to
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
05:00:55.350 --> 05:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
um and i think that would probably that
 
05:00:57.190 --> 05:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
would take care of the uh of the
 
05:00:59.030 --> 05:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguity but thank you for pointing
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
that out could you repeat that please
 
05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
sure the language i would add to the
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
very end of the sentence
 
05:01:05.840 --> 05:01:06.868 align:start position:0%
very end of the sentence
uh

05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:01:06.878 --> 05:01:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh
the

05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
words granted pursuant to rsa
 
05:01:16.680 --> 05:01:16.690 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.690 --> 05:01:18.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative magic cody
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr barry
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
um this is at a point where
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
low income totally
 
05:01:40.320 --> 05:01:41.350 align:start position:0%
low income totally
uh

05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:01:41.360 --> 05:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
uh
face

05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
face
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
because of the housing shortage
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
in either eviction
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
which leads to homelessness or providing
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
the support at the most critical
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
place where we are trying to reduce the
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
number of homelessness
 
05:02:02.550 --> 05:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
isn't uh can i make that assumption
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
you can and you said it better than i
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
did thank you
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.680 --> 05:02:10.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
next speak here mr chairman yes i'm
 
05:02:15.110 --> 05:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're from uh legal assistance that's
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
correct what's the liability for the
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
town because uh it allows a citizen or a
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
resident to sit
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
in a it's a building that potentially is
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
not a state
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
if something happens is there any kind
 
05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
of liability that would result back on
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
the town for a natural inspection and
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
confirming its success i've never seen a
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
case like that and in fact the cities in
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
every city and town in in new hampshire
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
today as we speak a number of households
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
are living in homes that are seriously
 
05:02:52.958 --> 05:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
are living in homes that are seriously
substandard

05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
my question was oh the town sanctioning
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
this by giving them funds to stay in an
 
05:03:03.030 --> 05:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
unsafe building because it didn't assume
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
any liability i don't think so i've
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
never seen it
 
05:03:11.430 --> 05:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i should point out uh
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think this is helpful to know the
 
05:03:15.910 --> 05:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
majority of municipalities do not do
 
05:03:18.550 --> 05:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
this as far as i know and again i don't
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
think they've i've never heard of a case
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
where they've been found liable for
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
providing assistance to places that
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't need code
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%

on my screen
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
i do not see any other members of the
 
05:03:38.550 --> 05:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
public mr chair
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
two members two members from our
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative imagined booty he had
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
a third question
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
i know sorry i didn't
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
put my hand down okay uh representative
 
05:03:53.760 --> 05:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
put my hand down okay uh representative
please

05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um
 
05:03:58.798 --> 05:04:00.868 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um
uh

05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
my question is that uh currently if a
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
unit is what i would consider
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
substandard and i have seen some of
 
05:04:08.638 --> 05:04:09.750 align:start position:0%
substandard and i have seen some of
those

05:04:09.750 --> 05:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
without the
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
request of the tenant the municipality
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
cannot do anything in other words we
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
can't force our way in or or anything to
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
that nature is that correct
 
05:04:27.910 --> 05:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
i believe there is a procedure to get an
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
administrative warrant
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh but again that is something that
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
happens very very rarely um the other
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing that you should know just to
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
complete the picture though is that when
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
it gets to a situation where it really
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
is a um a serious threat to the health
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
and safety either of the residents or
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
or of the general public
 
05:04:52.400 --> 05:04:53.230 align:start position:0%
or of the general public
the

05:04:53.230 --> 05:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities usually through the fire
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
department but also sometimes to the
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
health department can bring in action to
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually they get cease and desist order
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
to move people out and they do that um
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
not often but when they do that happens
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
05:05:11.760 --> 05:05:12.830 align:start position:0%
very quickly
thank

05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%

05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%

05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
banking opportunities to institutions
 
05:09:31.270 --> 05:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
that may not be chartered in new
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire but are local banks for
 
05:09:33.360 --> 05:09:34.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire but are local banks for
example

05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
bangor savings bank in colebrook was the
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
original first colebrook bank and has
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
been in the same location since 1889
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
yet it is unable to be utilized by coast
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
county as a banking institution because
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
it is not chartered in new hampshire
 
05:09:52.550 --> 05:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely important
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
bill to our more rural and border
 
05:09:57.030 --> 05:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
counties that have to drive extended
 
05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
distances to complete county banking
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
while technological enhancements have
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
increased some banking access there are
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
still some items particularly our
 
05:10:09.030 --> 05:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
nursing homes where we need to have cash
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
on hand and transactions cannot be
 
05:10:13.990 --> 05:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
completed electronically it would also
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
allow us to seek out the best banking
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our counties we would
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
ask for your support for house bill 545

half of our branches have been opened in
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%

05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
my point in all these facts is strictly
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
to point out that our commitment to the
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is as solid as
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
any of the institutions that may be
 
05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise chartered out of states and

charitable contributions of almost seven
 
05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%

and for example the bank recently

years
 
05:14:10.230 --> 05:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
our support of new hampshire
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
organizations is not limited time and
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
cash contributions we've also supported
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%

over 12 very worthy projects in the
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying here today
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
with the expectation of leveling the
 
05:14:32.830 --> 05:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
playing field for our government banking
 
05:14:32.840 --> 05:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
playing field for our government banking
division

05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
division
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
currently new hampshire laws require
 
05:14:38.070 --> 05:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
banks charted in other states to post
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
collateral from new hampshire miscible
 
05:14:40.080 --> 05:14:41.510 align:start position:0%
collateral from new hampshire miscible
deposits

05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
deposits
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
out-of-state banks which have national
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
charters don't have that same
 
05:14:46.390 --> 05:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
requirement and so what we're looking to
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
do is is to see that banks are treated
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
fairly regardless of
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.000 --> 05:14:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
we started our uh opened our government
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
banking business in 2019 we learned that
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
the playing field wasn't level
 
05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
but we forged ahead anyways and what we
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
have done is
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that the additional collateral
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
requirements required by new hampshire
 
05:15:15.120 --> 05:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
requirements required by new hampshire
regulation

05:15:16.360 --> 05:15:16.370 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
05:15:16.370 --> 05:15:17.670 align:start position:0%
regulation
[Music]

05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
are covered
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
in our costs and so as accordingly
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the rates that we pay to our new
 
05:15:24.788 --> 05:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipalities are lower than
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
what we pay in another state because of
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
the collateral requirements
 
05:15:30.070 --> 05:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
so in fact it's not the bank that
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily suffers from this
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
requirement but is the local
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities which could be earning uh
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
more on their deposits a higher interest
 
05:15:38.480 --> 05:15:39.910 align:start position:0%
more on their deposits a higher interest
rate

05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so while the bill generally does
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
ensure fairness for tax paying
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire there are
 
05:15:46.470 --> 05:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
some aspects of the current version of
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that fall short of its
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
potential good to provide municipalities
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
with access to more banking choices
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
the our bank is generally supportive of
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
language in sections one a through d
 
05:16:00.550 --> 05:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
however these sections need to be
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
modified in our opinion to be fair to
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
all banks regardless of charter
 
05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
banks have played an important part in
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
our country's response to covet 19 and
 
05:16:14.310 --> 05:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
community banks in particular have been
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
very supportive of local businesses
 
05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
community support organizations and
 
05:16:18.080 --> 05:16:19.350 align:start position:0%
community support organizations and
individuals

05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
we are committed to working with the
 
05:16:22.868 --> 05:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
legislature to ensure that new hampshire
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the same opportunity
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
to get top quality banking services at a
 
05:16:29.430 --> 05:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
fair price
 
05:16:31.190 --> 05:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
while we agree with the spirit of the
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
bill we believe more refinement of the
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
language is necessarily necessary
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
particularly since it could have
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
unattended consequences which would
 
05:16:40.550 --> 05:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately do a disservice to new
 
05:16:42.390 --> 05:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipalities
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%

very good thank you so much mr chairman
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
as i said i'm president of new hampshire
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
bankers association we represent 37
 
05:18:34.150 --> 05:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
state and federally chartered banks
 
05:18:36.550 --> 05:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
which employ nearly 6 000 employees in
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify that we were
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the legislation last year as
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
was stated but we did not have an
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
official position so we were very much
 
05:18:47.830 --> 05:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
involved in the dialogue
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
and worked in the sponsor but we we
 
05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
weren't officially taking a position
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
um and so attorney dietl is here today
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
and he can help answer any legal
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions as well
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
while we don't have an official position
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
we do come before the committee today to
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that this bill be
 
05:19:03.600 --> 05:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that this bill be
amended

05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
amended
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
to allow for a study committee
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
turning house bill 545 into a study
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee will allow for more thorough
 
05:19:14.070 --> 05:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
review and allow for input from various
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to ensure the proposal
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
creates a level playing field i would
 
05:19:22.150 --> 05:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
like to say that we support the um we
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand that municipalities want to
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
have more banking options and we support
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
that but it is very complicated we want
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we get this
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislation right
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned our membership
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
consists of new hampshire chartered
 
05:19:38.070 --> 05:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
banks banks chartered in other states
 
05:19:40.150 --> 05:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
and nationally chartered banks
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
municipal deposits is a very complex
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
issue and affects the members of
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
association in different ways depending
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
on their charter
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
under the current statutes banks banks
 
05:19:52.948 --> 05:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
chartered in other states are limited
 
05:19:54.868 --> 05:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
and the types of municipal deposits they
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
can accept while new hampshire charter
 
05:19:59.510 --> 05:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
banks and nationally chartered banks
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
with a physical presence don't have the
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
same limitations
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
this proposal attempts to break down the
 
05:20:07.270 --> 05:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
barrier these statutes currently create
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
giving out of state charter banks
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
greater access to municipal deposits and
 
05:20:13.350 --> 05:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
you heard a little bit from newburyport
 
05:20:15.830 --> 05:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
bank about about how that works
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is nearly identical to a
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
proposal from last year house bill 1119
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
and as i said we worked closely to the
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor to come up with a solution that
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
would create a level playing field for
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
all banks and the different charters but
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the end though we feel the bill did
 
05:20:33.830 --> 05:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
not achieve that goal
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we asked the committee last year as
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
we did today to to to take a to make
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
that bill a study committee
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
what we are trying to do today is make
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
sure that the legislation does not harm
 
05:20:47.670 --> 05:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
out-of-state banks that currently hold
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
municipal deposits
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
we also want to make sure that new
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire banks have comparable access
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
to municipal deposits in other states
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that's a very tricky point
 
05:20:58.830 --> 05:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
and it's also important that the
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are seeking
 
05:21:03.190 --> 05:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
additional options are not negatively
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
impacted by this legislation and we
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
understand that that is not the intent
 
05:21:07.360 --> 05:21:08.708 align:start position:0%
understand that that is not the intent
here

05:21:08.708 --> 05:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:21:10.230 --> 05:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
in order to accomplish this we believe
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's important to carefully work with
 
05:21:13.510 --> 05:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
the various stakeholders in order to
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
strike the right balance
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um i do want to point out that in trying
 
05:21:19.590 --> 05:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
to come up with a workable solution last
 
05:21:19.600 --> 05:21:20.470 align:start position:0%
to come up with a workable solution last
year

05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
we did have conversations with the
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
treasurer since they play a role in this
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that conversation occurred with
 
05:21:29.350 --> 05:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
former treasurer bill dwyer
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're unaware if any conversation like
 
05:21:33.030 --> 05:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
that has happened with our current
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
treasure monica mezzapelli but
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
we believe that certainly would be
 
05:21:37.200 --> 05:21:38.628 align:start position:0%
we believe that certainly would be
appropriate

05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we understand that the rationale
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
behind this desire is to bring
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
bring in language that originates from a
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
constituent trying to adjust challenges
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
and their banking needs i understand
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
that there was an interest in placing
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
nursing home and prison residence funds
 
05:21:57.510 --> 05:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
in a bank that's chartered out of state
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we did hear a little bit about this
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
um attorney dietl can speak to it but
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
after legal review and looking at the
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
exact existing statutes those funds are
 
05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
not considered to be publicly owned
 
05:22:09.760 --> 05:22:10.788 align:start position:0%
not considered to be publicly owned
funds

05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
and should be able to be deposited into
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
the county's bank of choice but we
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
understand the municipalities are
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
looking for additional options and we
 
05:22:21.190 --> 05:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
are supportive of that intent
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
again we don't have a position overall
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
on the bill we do want to get it right
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
for banks that do business here and
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we're respectfully asking the
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
committee to amend the bill into a study
 
05:22:30.958 --> 05:22:32.150 align:start position:0%
committee to amend the bill into a study
committee

05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:22:34.470 --> 05:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
um that ends my testimony and i will
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions and we'll um hand it
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
over to attorney diedel as well
 
05:22:42.550 --> 05:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay oh i see two questions ferdinand 40
 
05:22:43.990 --> 05:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
is your hand
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um this bill came
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
through us last year um and it's
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that putting this into a
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
study committee will further delay the
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
relief that the um
 
05:22:57.040 --> 05:22:59.110 align:start position:0%
relief that the um
the

05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
counties and cities in uh
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
the north country have been experiencing
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's already been tape um tabled in the
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
senate last time and now if we put it
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
into a study committee that means that
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
it nothing will happen with it this year
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
and then it will be next year again
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
before that's three years to wait and
 
05:23:18.070 --> 05:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that can you address
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
that lag in time and how
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
your association would recommend helping
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
these communities order
 
05:23:28.390 --> 05:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i would ask i hear what you're
 
05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
saying but it sounds like that's an
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
executive committee discussion i would
 
05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
ask if you could formulate your comment
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
form of a question
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
i did i asked how they would recommend
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
the communities proceed while they're
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
waiting for this for this study
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee to come up with a solution for
 
05:23:43.200 --> 05:23:45.270 align:start position:0%
committee to come up with a solution for
them

05:23:45.270 --> 05:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative our understanding as i
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned was that
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
the county was looking to place
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
prison resident funds and also
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
to put their funds into and out of state
 
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
bank and our understanding is that they
 
05:24:04.708 --> 05:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that there may be
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
other concerns that i'm not aware of and
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
and like i said um you know we my
 
05:24:12.550 --> 05:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
concern with this legislation as it's
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
proposed as it could have some
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences um and and you
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit from from newberry
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
port bank but in in this legislation i
 
05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
think what's most important are two
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
goals um one is to make sure that the
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
public funds um the public's funds are
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
safe and sound and second is to make
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the funds are invested in
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
communities where they're generated and
 
05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
so that's what this legislation tries to
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
do but we don't think that the solution
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
is quite right and because this is such
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
a big issue and that impacts so many
 
05:24:44.080 --> 05:24:45.030 align:start position:0%
a big issue and that impacts so many
people

05:24:45.030 --> 05:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
we do want to make sure that we help
 
05:24:48.868 --> 05:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
those that need it but we also want to
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get it right this is a
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
statute these are many statutes that
 
05:24:54.310 --> 05:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
haven't been changed in a long time and
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
so it very well may be time to to take a
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
broader um look at this but would just
 
05:25:02.550 --> 05:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we try to
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate any unintended consequences
 
05:25:08.070 --> 05:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
christie this is this is rob dietl if i
 
05:25:10.390 --> 05:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
can add on specifically in response to
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
rep porter's question um
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to note that
 
05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
while the public testimony has focused
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
on county funds that the bill is
 
05:25:21.510 --> 05:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
proposing amendments to i believe nine
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
different statutes that deal with state
 
05:25:26.708 --> 05:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
funds county funds town and city funds
 
05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
school treasurer funds
 
05:25:30.628 --> 05:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
and they impact more than just the
 
05:25:32.788 --> 05:25:32.798 align:start position:0%
specific issue that we believe has come
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
to light
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
05:25:36.788 --> 05:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
funds being held with respect to county
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities
 
05:25:41.590 --> 05:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
they impact how funds are invested
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
deposited trust funds where capital
 
05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
reserve funds can be placed to give you
 
05:25:48.628 --> 05:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
an example of the level of complexity
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
here in rsa 29.1
 
05:25:53.430 --> 05:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
there are a number of restrictions on
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
how counties specifically can deal with
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
their deposits and investments
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
currently county treasurers can place
 
05:26:02.230 --> 05:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
those deposits in federally chartered
 
05:26:02.240 --> 05:26:03.190 align:start position:0%
those deposits in federally chartered
banks

05:26:03.190 --> 05:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
banks
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire banks
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
and out of state banks if they're
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
collateralized but investments are
 
05:26:11.110 --> 05:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
limited to federally chartered banks and
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire banks
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i highlight these points because i
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
think they really show that this is an
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
area that has evolved over a number of
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
years with various policy objectives
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
under the various types of funds that
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
are implicated and it's not a simple
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
solution from our perspective and that's
 
05:26:30.550 --> 05:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
why we're asking in part for a study on
 
05:26:30.560 --> 05:26:34.550 align:start position:0%
why we're asking in part for a study on
this

05:26:34.550 --> 05:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative nanchikuri
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh having not been on this committee
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:26:42.958 --> 05:26:43.830 align:start position:0%
last year
um

05:26:43.830 --> 05:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is my first time and to understand
 
05:26:51.750 --> 05:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
if it is it passed last year 18 to 1
 
05:26:51.760 --> 05:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
if it is it passed last year 18 to 1
and

05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
these concerns have showed up now in
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to address the need for
 
05:27:01.510 --> 05:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
our county and
 
05:27:03.270 --> 05:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
residents of the
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
north country
 
05:27:07.350 --> 05:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
get a relief
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm kind of
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
puzzled as to how come this is such a
 
05:27:13.280 --> 05:27:14.070 align:start position:0%
puzzled as to how come this is such a
big

05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
big
 
05:27:14.080 --> 05:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
big
issue

05:27:15.110 --> 05:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we were
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
involved in the conversation last year
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
and we worked very closely with
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative wayne moynihan
 
05:27:31.350 --> 05:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know attorney dietl can speak to
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
some of the complications here we argued
 
05:27:36.628 --> 05:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully last year for a study
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
committee ultimately the committee
 
05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward with the
 
05:27:40.160 --> 05:27:41.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward with the
legislation

05:27:41.670 --> 05:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
and as the sponsor said it went to the
 
05:27:45.910 --> 05:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
senate where it was placed on the table
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
so we did voice our concerns then as
 
05:27:48.000 --> 05:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
so we did voice our concerns then as
well

05:27:49.590 --> 05:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
it was we had engaged in many
 
05:27:53.590 --> 05:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
moynihan and the legislation went
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
through various iterations um before the
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee passed it and
 
05:28:02.310 --> 05:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
we so we were part of that but um it's
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
just an evolving conversation and i
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't know attorney deedle is there
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
anything you'd like to add
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
what i will add is that the legislation
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
when it was advanced last year and it
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
has the same language in it this year
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
is dependent on the state treasurer
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
playing a role in accepting uh opinions
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
of counsel as to reciprocity and we had
 
05:28:25.350 --> 05:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
some um detailed conversations with
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
previous state treasurer dwyer i'm not
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
sure if i know on the bankers
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
association side i don't believe those
 
05:28:33.030 --> 05:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
conversations have occurred i don't know
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
to what extent the sponsor has had a
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
chance to connect with the treasurer but
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's an important point to
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
hear from the treasurer as well in terms
 
05:28:40.320 --> 05:28:41.510 align:start position:0%
hear from the treasurer as well in terms
of

05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
whether this structure is still an
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable structure
 
05:28:48.788 --> 05:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
okay representative status thank you mr
 
05:28:48.798 --> 05:28:49.990 align:start position:0%
okay representative status thank you mr
chair

05:28:49.990 --> 05:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ignore the advice about
 
05:28:54.470 --> 05:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
never ask a question you don't know the
 
05:28:56.470 --> 05:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
answer to because i truly don't know the
 
05:28:58.310 --> 05:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
answer to this question
 
05:29:00.788 --> 05:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
but can one of the banking experts
 
05:29:02.548 --> 05:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
testifying today
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
tell me where bar harbor bank is
 
05:29:05.360 --> 05:29:12.708 align:start position:0%
tell me where bar harbor bank is
chartered

05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.070 --> 05:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
sure representative this is christy
 
05:29:15.990 --> 05:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
merrill i can try to answer that they
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
are chartered in maine my understanding
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
do business in new hampshire correct
 
05:29:20.958 --> 05:29:22.230 align:start position:0%
do business in new hampshire correct
correct

05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.310 --> 05:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite sure i understand your
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
question if you're asking why is bar
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
harbor bank treated differently um i
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
think what it really comes down to and
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
where we struggled um is the is the
 
05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
notion of reciprocity so um you know if
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
we take the states immediately around us
 
05:29:50.230 --> 05:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
in maine um in vermont um attorney dieto
 
05:29:51.750 --> 05:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
will tell you that
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
the laws there are reasonably comparable
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
so a new hampshire chartered bank that
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
does business over the border there
 
05:30:01.510 --> 05:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
they would be able to
 
05:30:03.990 --> 05:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
hold municipal deposits there are some
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
differences in the state of
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which make it a little bit
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit different and so part of
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
the challenge we have with this
 
05:30:11.360 --> 05:30:12.390 align:start position:0%
the challenge we have with this
legislation

05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
is you know we originally went to the
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
banking department because
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
we thought they were a lot they would be
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
a logical arbiter to decide what is a
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
reciprocal treatment and we think that's
 
05:30:27.270 --> 05:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
very important to make sure that all of
 
05:30:29.990 --> 05:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
the banks have an equal playing field
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
and you know as the the banking
 
05:30:34.470 --> 05:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner pointed out these statutes
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
are not located in the banking
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
department statutes they're scattered
 
05:30:38.080 --> 05:30:39.030 align:start position:0%
department statutes they're scattered
among

05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
among
 
05:30:40.310 --> 05:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
the many statutes that have been
 
05:30:42.628 --> 05:30:42.638 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier and so he did not
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
feel that was appropriate for the
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
banking department to really be the
 
05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
arbiter and so that's where we ended up
 
05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
with the treasurer's office and so
 
05:30:50.310 --> 05:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
having um
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know an attestation having legal
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
counsel do an opinion and submitting
 
05:30:56.310 --> 05:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
that attestation that they swear under
 
05:30:56.320 --> 05:30:57.270 align:start position:0%
that attestation that they swear under
oath

05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
oath
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it is in fact uh reciprocal um then
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard newburyport banks talk
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
about how they have concerns about that
 
05:31:06.150 --> 05:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
um that was a solution that was put
 
05:31:07.350 --> 05:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
forward we're not sure if that's the
 
05:31:09.670 --> 05:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
right solution or not but again we're
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
trying to really get at that that issue
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
of reciprocity
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
which is really important to make sure
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
that each of the states are playing um
 
05:31:20.310 --> 05:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
in a similar manner and treat it the
 
05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
same way follow up mr chair yes go ahead
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
i am thoroughly confused now
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
my question had to do with bar harbor
 
05:31:28.638 --> 05:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
my question had to do with bar harbor
bank

05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
bank
 
05:31:29.600 --> 05:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
bank
which

05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
up until a few years ago was called lake
 
05:31:35.430 --> 05:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
sunapee bank
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
so what is the difference between is it
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
a difference between um
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
we like massachusetts less than we like
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
maine i i i just don't understand what
 
05:31:46.150 --> 05:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
the objection is and and why the
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
objection wasn't raised
 
05:31:51.830 --> 05:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
when bar harbor bank became lake sunapee
 
05:31:51.840 --> 05:31:56.150 align:start position:0%
when bar harbor bank became lake sunapee
bank

05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
the other way around
 
05:31:59.040 --> 05:32:02.230 align:start position:0%
the other way around
sorry

05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
did you know the sellers
 
05:32:06.868 --> 05:32:06.878 align:start position:0%
yes wasn't it the other way around bar
 
05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:32:16.708 --> 05:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
that is correct representative i i think
 
05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's a similar situation
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know whether or not there
 
05:32:20.638 --> 05:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know whether or not there
was

05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
um complaints mentioned at that time but
 
05:32:26.548 --> 05:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
obviously in the banking industry it's a
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's a trend here in new hampshire with
 
05:32:29.910 --> 05:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of mergers and acquisitions and
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's a trend nationally we know that's
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
a concern and as i stated originally
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
we want we support the municipalities um
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
wanting to have additional banking
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
options but we just want to make sure
 
05:32:44.830 --> 05:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
that we get all of our all of these laws
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
correct in doing so
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%

no additional hands on the purpose there
 
05:33:01.750 --> 05:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
i do not see any additional hands up
 
05:33:05.190 --> 05:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
from panelists or from any of the
 
05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%

all right we're gonna go immediately
 
05:33:19.830 --> 05:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
into executive sessions
 
05:33:21.190 --> 05:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
i would ask
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
those members of the committee to pay
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
the bills that uh that i bring up and
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
we'll all have opportunities
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair is it possible to get a list
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%

representative gallagher

yes could you remind us please what that
 
05:35:17.190 --> 05:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
this was the bill about
 
05:35:22.470 --> 05:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
restricting the amount of authority that
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
local governments had
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
05:35:26.558 --> 05:35:27.990 align:start position:0%
i think the
example

05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
that was mostly discussed was around the
 
05:35:31.360 --> 05:35:32.788 align:start position:0%
that was mostly discussed was around the
pandemic

05:35:32.788 --> 05:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:37.200 --> 05:35:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i
 
05:35:44.948 --> 05:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be voting i'm not going to
 
05:35:46.868 --> 05:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
be voting in favor of the ought to pass
 
05:35:49.350 --> 05:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
motion and my concerns are
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
are numerous about this but i will i
 
05:35:54.150 --> 05:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
will limit it to if in the constitution
 
05:35:54.160 --> 05:35:55.670 align:start position:0%
will limit it to if in the constitution
itself

05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:35:59.590 --> 05:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
the term general good is not defined
 
05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
um and we look here at well-being as the
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
term which seems to be giving the the
 
05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors the most grief
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh then then i then i i see uh i see no
 
05:36:14.708 --> 05:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
reason to take that language out we
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
understood we understand from the
 
05:36:16.320 --> 05:36:17.750 align:start position:0%
understood we understand from the
constitution

05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
a general idea of what the general good
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
is and i think we should leave it to the
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
local municipalities
 
05:36:26.948 --> 05:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
to have the flexibility to decide what
 
05:36:28.150 --> 05:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
is in
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
what well-being means to their community
 
05:36:33.670 --> 05:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative clay
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
your comment
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i um
 
05:36:40.868 --> 05:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
also will be voting against ought to
 
05:36:40.878 --> 05:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
also will be voting against ought to
pass

05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:36:44.788 --> 05:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to limit my comment
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i do have an issue with the fact that
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
it would mean that we would have to
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
bring the body together in order to come
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
up with a decision and in the case of an
 
05:36:57.190 --> 05:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
emergency this could be quite
 
05:37:00.390 --> 05:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
quite an undertaking um also in in light
 
05:37:03.430 --> 05:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we don't have um
 
05:37:03.440 --> 05:37:04.948 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we don't have um
enough

05:37:04.948 --> 05:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
i guess it was brought up about the
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
zoning laws etc etc so are we going to
 
05:37:10.868 --> 05:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
have to each time we want to make any
 
05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
changes to that have to come to the um
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
the board and um
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
i i just think that there's too many
 
05:37:22.868 --> 05:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my comment echoes
 
05:37:27.990 --> 05:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
both representative cleese and
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore
 
05:37:30.000 --> 05:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore
especially

05:37:31.430 --> 05:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
especially
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the term well-being
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's there for a reason i don't
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a frivolous term as some of
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
the folks who testified before us
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a salient term in regards
 
05:37:47.590 --> 05:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
to the health and well-being of a town a
 
05:37:47.600 --> 05:37:51.990 align:start position:0%
to the health and well-being of a town a
municipality

05:37:51.990 --> 05:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:54.470 --> 05:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
called unincorporated space and the
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
people who live in those spaces can make
 
05:37:58.390 --> 05:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
that judgment call
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the well-being the well-being of
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
dover might be very different than the
 
05:38:04.230 --> 05:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
well-being of nashua
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
yet they are both
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
well-being and i will be voting no on
 
05:38:09.120 --> 05:38:10.788 align:start position:0%
well-being and i will be voting no on
this

05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative magic
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i will be voting
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
no on this uh to pass for a couple of
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasons one is the fact that on one hand
 
05:38:25.270 --> 05:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
we are trying to push
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility to the local
 
05:38:28.320 --> 05:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility to the local
control

05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
and on the same token we're going to tie
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
the hands of the local government to
 
05:38:35.360 --> 05:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
the hands of the local government to
make

05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:41.670 --> 05:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
emergency decisions or ordinances to
 
05:38:43.990 --> 05:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
safeguard the well-being of their
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
community just like my colleagues have
 
05:38:46.878 --> 05:38:48.868 align:start position:0%
community just like my colleagues have
expressed

05:38:48.868 --> 05:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic is a good example where nashua
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
did the right thing i feel safe my
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
constituents feel safe that was needed
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
and this will be taken away
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill passes for that reason
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting now representative porter
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:39:08.000 --> 05:39:09.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

05:39:09.110 --> 05:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
it was commented during the testimony
 
05:39:11.920 --> 05:39:13.030 align:start position:0%
it was commented during the testimony
that

05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:39:15.110 --> 05:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
the government needs to be responsive to
 
05:39:16.708 --> 05:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
the citizens
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
and that they that the
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
local government shouldn't be passing
 
05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances that the citizens
 
05:39:26.310 --> 05:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't want but it's the citizens of the
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
community that elect their
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
representatives to either the city
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
council or the select board or whatever
 
05:39:34.708 --> 05:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
and they elect those people especially
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
in a city to be uh representative of
 
05:39:37.440 --> 05:39:38.470 align:start position:0%
in a city to be uh representative of
them

05:39:38.470 --> 05:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:39:42.390 --> 05:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and make decisions for them that the
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
ten thousand people in the city can't
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
get together and make for themselves
 
05:39:50.788 --> 05:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
to take away the local authority to make
 
05:39:54.150 --> 05:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
ordinances takes away the voice of the
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
people who are elected to represent the
 
05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
people so i i feel that it's
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
contradictory in nature and would be
 
05:40:04.470 --> 05:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
detrimental to local control
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
i simply want to echo what
 
05:40:12.070 --> 05:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative porter just said that was
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what i was going to say
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i had my real hand up
 
05:51:00.718 --> 05:51:01.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i had my real hand up
and

05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
i couldn't coordinate myself to get the
 
05:51:06.310 --> 05:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
other hand on
 
05:51:06.320 --> 05:51:08.868 align:start position:0%
other hand on
um

05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm conflicted about this bill
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm conflicted because
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
the son of gorham has
 
05:51:19.830 --> 05:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
been thoughtful and done its work and
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
trying to think ahead
 
05:51:24.310 --> 05:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
how things might work for them
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
and the tongue clerks association person
 
05:51:28.548 --> 05:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
although he was
 
05:51:31.110 --> 05:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
very um
 
05:51:31.120 --> 05:51:33.510 align:start position:0%
very um
persuasive

05:51:33.510 --> 05:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
persuasive
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
he's in favor of the way most people do
 
05:51:39.190 --> 05:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
it and town clerks do it and he's not
 
05:51:39.200 --> 05:51:40.868 align:start position:0%
it and town clerks do it and he's not
necessarily

05:51:40.868 --> 05:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
05:51:40.878 --> 05:51:43.350 align:start position:0%
necessarily
uh

05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
sort of as i said before
 
05:51:47.990 --> 05:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
got the well-being of gorham in mind he
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
may have the well-being of tom clerks in
 
05:51:51.350 --> 05:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
mind and he was very
 
05:51:53.110 --> 05:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
i think a little presumptuous when he
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
said well
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
someone will run don't worry someone
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
will run
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
well not necessarily someone will run
 
05:52:00.558 --> 05:52:01.910 align:start position:0%
well not necessarily someone will run
and

05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:06.788 --> 05:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
to say no to a town that's trying to
 
05:52:11.190 --> 05:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
find a proactive solution to
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
what they consider a problem the one
 
05:52:15.510 --> 05:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
thing that i might
 
05:52:17.830 --> 05:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
hope that they heard from the testimony
 
05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
is that they could split those two
 
05:52:19.360 --> 05:52:21.190 align:start position:0%
is that they could split those two
positions

05:52:21.190 --> 05:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
and it might be easier for
 
05:52:27.110 --> 05:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
two people to run than one person to run
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
for two jobs
 
05:52:31.350 --> 05:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
um and again i'm still conflicted that's
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
my only commentary i'll listen to others
 
05:52:39.830 --> 05:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
yeah justin if i may i only can
 
05:52:47.110 --> 05:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
go by my own experience but i think as i
 
05:52:47.120 --> 05:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
go by my own experience but i think as i
said

05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
in hampstead we had
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
a uh vacancy
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
was in between the elections
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we appointed somebody
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:53:00.190 --> 05:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
05:53:00.200 --> 05:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
they uh
subsequently

05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
subsequently
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
iran and it's been a very successful
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
town clerk after being trained
 
05:53:09.830 --> 05:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh she's been with us probably
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
12 13 years
 
05:53:11.760 --> 05:53:12.708 align:start position:0%
12 13 years
and

05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:12.718 --> 05:53:13.670 align:start position:0%
and
so

05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't think goth
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh chrome has to uh worry too much about
 
05:53:22.470 --> 05:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
a process to get a
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
a town clerk there
 
05:53:27.510 --> 05:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh they'll get somebody as i know it's
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
just to say somebody will run but there
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
is somebody out there if you shake the
 
05:53:32.638 --> 05:53:33.590 align:start position:0%
is somebody out there if you shake the
trees

05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
trees
 
05:53:36.070 --> 05:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't think they have anything
 
05:53:37.990 --> 05:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
to fear and i don't think this solves
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
their problem anyway
 
05:53:43.590 --> 05:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think they still have to get somebody
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
who's qualified if they have to get
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
somebody to do the job whether it's by
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
appointment or election
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh they they have either vehicle and
 
05:53:54.868 --> 05:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
they have uh have election i
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we should make an
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
exception and i think they can work
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
around this
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
by talking to the town clerk tax
 
05:54:07.750 --> 05:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
collectors that are on
 
05:54:11.430 --> 05:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh board now and make sure that they
 
05:54:14.070 --> 05:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
resign in between the election then the
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
town the town
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
fathers the town selectmen
 
05:54:20.470 --> 05:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
can have some input
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
and uh go out and shake the trees and
 
05:54:24.788 --> 05:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
get somebody to run
 
05:54:28.150 --> 05:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
this is a comment from the chair um
 
05:54:30.230 --> 05:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
i think uh one of the things that we
 
05:54:31.990 --> 05:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
heard was you know
 
05:54:34.230 --> 05:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh it was just reference was that they
 
05:54:36.150 --> 05:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
won't be able to find somebody who's
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
gonna sign up
 
05:54:39.990 --> 05:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
and get themselves on the ballot well in
 
05:54:43.030 --> 05:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
cases like that i know in my town
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
we it's not uncommon to have
 
05:54:47.910 --> 05:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
nobody running for certain collective
 
05:54:51.030 --> 05:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
positions and we end up having a writing
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
campaign for somebody and whoever gets
 
05:54:55.350 --> 05:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
the most writings wins
 
05:54:57.110 --> 05:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
so you don't actually have to have
 
05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
someone sign up for the election
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
and they can't pay for it which it
 
05:55:02.310 --> 05:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
what i always hear is right between the
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
lines that
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
certain people don't want to go through
 
05:55:10.230 --> 05:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
the campaign and get signs and
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
all that stuff but this certainly
 
05:55:14.708 --> 05:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
won't stop the
 
05:55:16.230 --> 05:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
community from filling the position
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
through a writing campaign
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative clinton tell you that
 
05:55:20.080 --> 05:55:21.350 align:start position:0%

uh second
 
06:01:46.470 --> 06:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
most immediate second is there any

discussion on that though
 
06:01:50.788 --> 06:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
before we take a photo

emphasize that i i grabbed i guess one
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of working from home is
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
access to records and i grabbed the bill
 
06:02:41.190 --> 06:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
from from when we first saw it the
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
original bill and the amended bill
 
06:02:43.920 --> 06:02:44.868 align:start position:0%
original bill and the amended bill
and

06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh if anybody has any concerns about
 
06:02:48.470 --> 06:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
what we heard from the businesses from
 
06:02:50.628 --> 06:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
the banking association it seems all of
 
06:02:53.670 --> 06:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
their concerns or i i hope i don't want
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
to argue with an attorney as i am not
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
one and would lose that battle every day
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and twice on sunday
 
06:03:00.948 --> 06:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
but it seems that all of their concerns
 
06:03:03.030 --> 06:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
were addressed in the amendment
 
06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
according to all of my notes and the
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill that we have in front of us 512 is
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
that amended bill so uh i i
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%

house bill 284 which is the one that i
 
06:11:39.120 --> 06:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
house bill 284 which is the one that i
was

06:11:44.548 --> 06:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
erroneously spoken about before this is

06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's a different bill um that
 
06:11:59.030 --> 06:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is about involuntarily merged lots
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
well um i think we already voted on the
 
06:12:13.510 --> 06:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:16.150 --> 06:12:16.160 align:start position:0%

that's right 284 was the one that had
 
06:12:30.638 --> 06:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
that's right 284 was the one that had
the

06:12:31.670 --> 06:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
extended the date additional two years
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
to get it done yes there was some
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
06:12:41.110 --> 06:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
i know nhma opposed that they said they
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
had long enough and there was some other
 
06:12:43.920 --> 06:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
had long enough and there was some other
um

06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:48.788 --> 06:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
06:12:52.830 --> 06:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:00.868 --> 06:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
thought process around that so
 
06:13:03.190 --> 06:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
i'd like to uh
 
06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to look to uh representative
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
loseless for emotion mr chairman i move
 
06:13:12.310 --> 06:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
we retain
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
house bill 284
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
and uh is there a second
 
06:13:16.798 --> 06:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
and uh is there a second
second

06:13:17.830 --> 06:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:13:20.310 --> 06:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative power second says other
 
06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
discussions on the motion to retain
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
mr chair i would like to hear why
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
someone wants to retain this bill be
 
06:13:29.280 --> 06:13:32.708 align:start position:0%
someone wants to retain this bill be
curious

06:13:32.708 --> 06:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:35.190 --> 06:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
i just think that it needs more work
 
06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
that it's uh not ready to
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:45.510 --> 06:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
let me also say that it seemed to be a
 
06:13:45.520 --> 06:13:46.868 align:start position:0%
let me also say that it seemed to be a
wide

06:13:46.868 --> 06:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
wide
 
06:13:50.150 --> 06:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of consensus around
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we should do this or maybe we
 
06:13:54.548 --> 06:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
should adjust it a little bit it was
 
06:13:54.558 --> 06:13:55.830 align:start position:0%
should adjust it a little bit it was
my

06:13:55.830 --> 06:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
disagreement between
 
06:13:59.990 --> 06:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh no extension to a two-year extension
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
to a 10-year extension
 
06:14:07.670 --> 06:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:07.680 --> 06:14:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
that

06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:16.628 --> 06:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion to
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
retain uh yes
 
06:14:22.390 --> 06:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative yes mr chair yes please
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:14:27.030 --> 06:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:29.110 --> 06:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
again i don't know that representative
 
06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
porter's question was answered why would
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
we retain this bill
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
to do more work on it all it does is
 
06:14:35.200 --> 06:14:36.548 align:start position:0%
to do more work on it all it does is
extend

06:14:36.548 --> 06:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
extend
 
06:14:39.670 --> 06:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
a practice that's already in place
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
so it it it supports a practice that
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
landowners have been using and cities
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
and towns have been satisfied with and
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
this extends it for two years
 
06:14:52.310 --> 06:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
why would we stop it
 
06:14:54.390 --> 06:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
why would we not allow this to continue
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think uh
 
06:15:00.628 --> 06:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
the reason a rationale is um
 
06:15:02.948 --> 06:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
one of the rationales is that
 
06:15:05.510 --> 06:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
we we're not close to consensus on this
 
06:15:05.520 --> 06:15:07.430 align:start position:0%
we we're not close to consensus on this
representative

06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
i was going to say that
 
06:15:14.470 --> 06:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
it seems silly to only do it for two
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:22.548 --> 06:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
extend it another 10 years or or and
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:28.470 --> 06:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
well i'd be in favor of that yet i don't
 
06:15:30.230 --> 06:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
know if that we're at a point where we
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
can amend this bill right now without
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
bringing in a new one i'll be quiet
 
06:15:35.840 --> 06:15:40.310 align:start position:0%
bringing in a new one i'll be quiet
representative

06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
kerr with what i just heard because it's
 
06:15:43.990 --> 06:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
what i was going to say it seems like an
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to this
 
06:15:47.590 --> 06:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
could be could be done under the terms i
 
06:15:50.788 --> 06:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
just heard 10 years or indefinitely or
 
06:15:51.910 --> 06:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
we just
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
kill it but retaining the bill i i i
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
think we could do the work that would be
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
done in that time frame with it with an
 
06:15:58.958 --> 06:16:01.190 align:start position:0%
done in that time frame with it with an
amendment

06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:16:03.750 --> 06:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter
 
06:16:05.910 --> 06:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair is going to agree with what
 
06:16:05.920 --> 06:16:07.190 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair is going to agree with what
representative

06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:16:10.230 --> 06:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
maggiore just said of if our we can just
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
make an amendment it's it
 
06:16:14.390 --> 06:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
we might have to hold until wednesday
 
06:16:15.990 --> 06:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
the executive but
 
06:16:18.150 --> 06:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
if we retain it we're just going to make
 
06:16:23.190 --> 06:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:24.868 --> 06:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
i mean there might be other discussion
 
06:16:26.788 --> 06:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
that was had that i'm not familiar with
 
06:16:29.350 --> 06:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
but right now what i'm hearing is we
 
06:16:31.590 --> 06:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea but it's not long
 
06:16:33.190 --> 06:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
enough so we want to fix it make it
 
06:16:36.150 --> 06:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
longer or make it indefinite and then
 
06:16:38.310 --> 06:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know if that's the issue then an
 
06:16:40.310 --> 06:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
amendment could be
 
06:16:40.320 --> 06:16:41.990 align:start position:0%
amendment could be
done

06:16:41.990 --> 06:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%

06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh we have consensus around that what i
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to go through is go through
 
06:17:06.070 --> 06:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
an ols amendment and then just kill it
 
06:17:08.310 --> 06:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
on wednesday i want to make sure we have
 
06:17:10.310 --> 06:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
some type of consensus given the
 
06:17:14.548 --> 06:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative clee what are your
 
06:17:16.080 --> 06:17:18.830 align:start position:0%

thoughts

06:17:18.830 --> 06:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:18.840 --> 06:17:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

06:17:20.470 --> 06:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
06:17:20.480 --> 06:17:21.830 align:start position:0%
unmute
unmute

06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
06:17:25.030 --> 06:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i agree with my my colleagues
 
06:17:25.040 --> 06:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i agree with my my colleagues
um

06:17:25.830 --> 06:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:28.390 --> 06:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
i i think i i have no problems with 10
 
06:17:31.750 --> 06:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
years or in perpetuity um i i think to
 
06:17:34.548 --> 06:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
retain this to only basically do an
 
06:17:37.270 --> 06:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment later on in the in the fall
 
06:17:40.868 --> 06:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
just um or next year seems um
 
06:17:43.350 --> 06:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
like better use of our time and i would
 
06:17:45.510 --> 06:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
just recommend an amendment and i'm okay
 
06:17:51.170 --> 06:17:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:51.180 --> 06:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:17:59.110 --> 06:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:01.030 --> 06:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recommend in perpetuity i
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason why we should ever
 
06:18:06.230 --> 06:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
stop the the separation of involuntary
 
06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
involuntarily merged lots i i don't see
 
06:18:11.830 --> 06:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
that there's anything in it for us
 
06:18:14.628 --> 06:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
and a lot of grief for other people so
 
06:18:16.548 --> 06:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is an amendment saying
 
06:18:19.590 --> 06:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
that involuntarily merged lots can be
 
06:18:22.150 --> 06:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
unmerged at the landowner's request in
 
06:18:22.160 --> 06:18:23.750 align:start position:0%
unmerged at the landowner's request in
perpetuity

06:18:23.750 --> 06:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
06:18:25.990 --> 06:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
so is there is there consensus across
 
06:18:27.270 --> 06:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
the committee for
 
06:18:27.280 --> 06:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
the committee for
perpetuity

06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:33.510 --> 06:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
if there is we we uh look for a
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer to run that event that's more
 
06:18:37.270 --> 06:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
or less and we'll come back and we can
 
06:18:39.270 --> 06:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully get a unanimous vote on that
 
06:18:41.190 --> 06:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
who would like to volunteer to work with
 
06:18:46.390 --> 06:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:50.948 --> 06:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative van may do it i will
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
write an amendment and get it to ols
 
06:18:57.190 --> 06:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
later this afternoon all right then
 
06:19:00.230 --> 06:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
let's plan on accepting uh that bill on
 
06:19:03.270 --> 06:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
wednesday with an amendment
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
that sounds good to everybody
 
06:19:22.150 --> 06:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:26.070 --> 06:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
if it makes you feel any better mr chair
 
06:19:28.470 --> 06:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
we were pretty unanimous that we wanted
 
06:19:28.480 --> 06:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
we were pretty unanimous that we wanted
to

06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:19:31.110 --> 06:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
pass the bill
 
06:19:34.390 --> 06:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
we saw no reason to kill that bill so
 
06:19:36.548 --> 06:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
and the discussion we had was all about
 
06:19:39.350 --> 06:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
making it perpetual so
 
06:19:41.670 --> 06:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you on our side we're okay i don't
 
06:19:43.990 --> 06:19:44.000 align:start position:0%

06:20:03.910 --> 06:20:03.920 align:start position:0%

06:20:06.150 --> 06:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
as a representative staff that sent out
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
a amendment for that and we were waiting
 
06:20:08.878 --> 06:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
a amendment for that and we were waiting
for

06:20:09.750 --> 06:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:20:09.760 --> 06:20:10.788 align:start position:0%

06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:33.110 --> 06:20:33.120 align:start position:0%

animal control officer
 
06:20:44.708 --> 06:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
i just think that that one
 
06:20:47.110 --> 06:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
is of
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
get some very interesting testimony and
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
i just thought we needed more time
 
06:20:57.750 --> 06:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:57.760 --> 06:21:00.070 align:start position:0%

06:21:10.948 --> 06:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
mr chair my husband is now in the office
 
06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
with me if you see a stranger walking
 
06:21:15.670 --> 06:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
around that's who it is
 
06:21:18.470 --> 06:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay on on wednesday we are
 
06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled to meet at nine o'clock
 
06:21:25.510 --> 06:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
but next monday uh let's not forget it's
 
06:21:28.390 --> 06:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
gonna sneak up on 8 30 our start time
 
06:21:44.150 --> 06:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:47.910 --> 06:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
10 30. we have three budget bills to
 
06:21:47.920 --> 06:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
10 30. we have three budget bills to
hear

06:21:49.030 --> 06:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
hear
 
06:21:52.868 --> 06:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor is working to combine
 
06:21:55.190 --> 06:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
all three of those into one bill and
 
06:21:57.990 --> 06:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's why uh it's written out the way
 
06:21:59.750 --> 06:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
it is you try to be a little more
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
efficient especially when we get to the
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
general session we'll have
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
the plan would be to
 
06:22:07.200 --> 06:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
the plan would be to
hopefully

06:22:08.310 --> 06:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
06:22:10.628 --> 06:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
have one bill come out of that
 
06:22:13.030 --> 06:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
and two of them would be itl so we'll
 
06:22:15.430 --> 06:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
reduce it from three to one
 
06:22:17.430 --> 06:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
we'll see it may not happen that's
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's what the tide is at this point
 
06:22:20.470 --> 06:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
we'll try to make ourselves a little
 
06:22:24.150 --> 06:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:26.470 --> 06:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative your hand is up here
