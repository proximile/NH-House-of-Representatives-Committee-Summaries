00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%

okay we will open up the hearing for
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 258 and I'd like to
 
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.410 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 258 and I'd like to
recognize

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Coke
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's a Polish name so it's rhymes with
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
polka just in case that helps I should
 
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.300 align:start position:0%
have known that I'm sorry yeah
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
well welcome to Public Works and please
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
proceed thank you so much
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
um nice to be here with you guys today
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
um chair and members of the committee
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Senator Rebecca
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
Perkins quoka representing Senate
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
District 21 which is the city of
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and surrounding towns
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
so SB 258 is a refile of legislation
 
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.949 align:start position:0%
so SB 258 is a refile of legislation
that

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I introduced last year and
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
um both years we've we've had success in
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate but we've run into some
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
questions in the house so
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
um we brought this piece of legislation
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
back to address a specific situation in
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
my district in the town of Newington
 
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:57.380 align:start position:0%
there's a question between
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dot the town of Newington
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the Newington Historical Society
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
about how to dispose of a former Railway
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
Depot and so what we're looking to do in
 
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:11.300 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation is to enable
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
historical Societies in addition to
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be eligible
 
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.829 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be eligible
transferees

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
transferees
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the goal of the
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
language as proposed it's been through
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
many versions and I hope that you can
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
find this one acceptable the city of
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
Newington in this case does not want to
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
act as legal transferee and prefers not
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be sort of a legal intermediary and
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
so there are probably other historical
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
properties that are in a similar status
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
across the state which I think some
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
members of the preservation Alliance are
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
here to speak to today but the
 
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
historical society is willing and able
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
to take the this property and would like
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
to and so I urge you to um
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
move out to pass on SB 258 to allow for
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
preservation of this Railway Depot in
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
Newington and so many other historic and
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
cultural resources across our state and
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take any
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair any questions for the
 
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.730 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair any questions for the
senator

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for my question
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
um I have a question in the language
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
here under Section 1A line six
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
and then in comparison to Roman numeral
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
two section line 13. they seem to be one
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
line is saying that you're going to want
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
to sell it for whatever price below
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
market value and then in the next
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
section it says
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
not to sell it below market value and
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of uh
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
confused a little bit on how that works
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
and who determines at what point it's
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
under fair market value because
 
00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
personally I don't understand why the
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
state would sell anything under market
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
value okay thank you thank you for your
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
question representative so the
 
00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
construction of the language is intended
 
00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:10.910 align:start position:0%
construction of the language is intended
um

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
in lines four through nine two
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
sort of Define a circumstance under
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
which a property would be
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
able to be conveyed for less than
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
firmware fair market value so in lines
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
12 and 13 what we're doing is you know
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
sort of pointing to that exception the
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
public policy reason behind that
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
exception would be
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
as we read in lines four and five to say
 
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.190 align:start position:0%
as we read in lines four and five to say
that

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
um there are circumstances in which it
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
would be deemed to be in the overall
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
public interest to
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
transfer at less than fair market value
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
and so that would be based on the
 
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
historical social environmental or
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
economic benefits
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
um of the property so we're trying to
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
create a carve out essentially between
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
those two provisions
 
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.650 align:start position:0%
those two provisions
follow-up

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
so who's going to make that
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
determination as far as historical
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
social environmental and economical
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
value who makes that determination sure
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm sure that the assistant
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
administrator of dot is best positioned
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
to speak to the extensive process that
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
um this small piece of Statute is a part
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
of but uh that you know dot has
 
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
significant jurisdiction and discretion
 
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:34.910 align:start position:0%
significant jurisdiction and discretion
to

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
act here and so they have an existing
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
process that is is quite complicated
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're not seeking to change that we're
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
just seeking to give the commissioner in
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
um the discretion
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
when you know particular circumstances
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
arise such as this historical Railway
 
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.509 align:start position:0%
arise such as this historical Railway
Depot

00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
Depot
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
to transfer to for example the
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
Historical Society instead of its hands
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
being tied because it can only transfer
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
Senator uh I'm curious why you decided
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
to give the commissioner this power
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
rather than the long-range committee
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
this power which they already have over
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
at market value transfers
 
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question
 
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.189 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question
um

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:29.629 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
I think that the question the answer
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
likely lies in
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
um trying to find something that works
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
for all parties I know that the long
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
range committee does have discretion
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
over certain disposals but I think where
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
we ended up fitting this
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
into statute um
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
you know it just it made sense to have
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
the dot be the party that was sort of
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
I guess acting on that and behind me is
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
Ben Foster New Hampshire Housing and um
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
the assistant
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
administrator at Dot and so you know
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
there's a very complicated process and I
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
do too so maybe they can speak to that
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Senator my
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
question is why in this bill as it's
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
written then and I understand the intent
 
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
are your singling out just Highway and
 
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
Turnpike probably rather than property
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
purchase with General funds or fish and
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
game why not open it up to property
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
purchase with those funds as well and
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
any other funds sure I um it's a very
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
good question as well and as you know
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
dot has a tremendous number of
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
properties and so we've been through
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
extensive discussions to kind of
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
um figure out the best way to limit it I
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.889 align:start position:0%
think that
um

00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
the more limited it is perhaps the
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
easier it is for for parties to agree to
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
but I would certainly be open to a
 
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
change like what you're suggesting in
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
other words follow-ups you would be open
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
to amending it to include other
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
properties other than Highway and
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funded properties I would
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
whether the other folks in this room
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
would agree the number question yeah
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
um represent Mills thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes I'm I'm a little concerned as to why
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
normally if something like this comes
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
before us it comes with the town of
 
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:23.660 align:start position:0%
newington's total blessing uh and
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
specifically on line 14 it says if a
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
town city or county decides to resell
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the property it shall first off offer
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
the property to the state at market
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
value so there there is some specific
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
language already that
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
we we as a committee shouldn't be
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
handling this directly on the state
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
level it should be taken care of through
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
the town first
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and there
 
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.529 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question and there
are

00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
um again folks here to testify from
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
Newington but part of the reason we're
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
in front of you is
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
um that we have tried through various
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
Avenues to convince the town of
 
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.730 align:start position:0%
Avenues to convince the town of
Newington

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
Newington
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
um to just merely act as an intermediary
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
and this and they are are not interested
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
in that option so I believe
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
and again I don't want to um speak over
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
the experts behind me but
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
I believe that the town you know
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
essentially is first offered the
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
property and then
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
um if this sort of situation arises
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
where there's sort of an exception that
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
fits these criteria historical social or
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
economic benefit
 
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.650 align:start position:0%
economic benefit
um

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know that those are the situations
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
in which we sort of consider
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
transferring to a third party besides
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
municipality follow-up
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Jerry yeah because the way
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
this sounds is this is this is a bill
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
that is specifically designed around one
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
simple piece of property and it brings
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
no benefit to anybody else and the fact
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
that the town we're we're not usually in
 
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
the position that we override anything
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
that a town would have jurisdiction over
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
if if they wanted to do this and when
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
people want Bridges named when they want
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
city parks named we always make sure
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the town signs off on it first of
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
all and it's with their blessing and
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
then we'll go ahead and consider it so
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to tell you I'm having a
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
hard time considering over riding the
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
town's interest in this thank you sure
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
and if they may just respond they I
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
completely understand your opinion um
 
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.100 align:start position:0%
and I think the intent here is not
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily to be overriding the
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
municipality but rather in circumstances
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
where the town is not interested to have
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
another Avenue
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
represent Faulkner
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
my preference by saying my understanding
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
of what this does
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
this just adds something there is a
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
paragraph one in the current bill which
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
stays there which says that if there is
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
Surplus property Surplus Highway
 
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.049 align:start position:0%
Surplus property Surplus Highway
property

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's offered first to the municipality
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
and then paragraph two says if you know
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
if it goes to Mrs municipality it will
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
pay fair market Price
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
what we're inserting in is at 1A
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
which would be you know be you know if
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
one doesn't occur because you have to
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
offer to the town first
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't happen then they can
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
sell it
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
at lower the market value one of these
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
other situations applies
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh in in which case paragraph two
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
play because it's not the municipality
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
so I I think we're missing if we had
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
reprinted paragraph one I think it might
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
be a little bit easier to understand so
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
I think
were

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
the relationship between 1A and two is
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't any
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
other than to accept that out
 
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.789 align:start position:0%
other than to accept that out
okay

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
um per episode
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh in section two are Roman numeral two
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh it says if the town city or county
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
decides to resell the property and the
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
intent is to sell it to the historical
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
society is the Historical Society
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
owned by the town city or anything like
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
that or is it an entity upon itself
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I think there's two
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
um two separate items there if I may
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative so I think
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's a really simple subject so if um in
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
lines 14 and 15 I think that's
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
concerning if the municipality was the
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
transferee which in this circumstance
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
we're asking that it not be
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
um separately your question was was the
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
historical society owned by the town or
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
city and the answer is no it's a private
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
non-profit entity so
 
00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419 align:start position:0%
um I think lines 14 and 15 would apply
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
to the town I think what we're trying to
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
do is have um lines four through nine
 
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question and I
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
will preface it that maybe it's my
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
reading of it or punctuation but going
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
back to lines six and seven the subject
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
property may be disposed or leased at
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
less than fair market value comma as
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
determined by the governor and Council
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
is the determination by the governor and
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
Council as to whether it be disposed or
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
leased or to determine that it's at
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
below fair market value that is a very
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
good question representative I I believe
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
that is intended to modify less than
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
fair market value because it's the you
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
know I think it's the commissioner that
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
has the discretion to exercise the
 
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.529 align:start position:0%
has the discretion to exercise the
exception

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:52.130 align:start position:0%
exception
um

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
but I can look into that and make sure
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking correctly okay just to
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
follow up on I guess on that fine point
 
00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:02.510 align:start position:0%
follow up on I guess on that fine point
so

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get my my head around it
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
so it's determined that it's at less
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
than fair market value but there would
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
have to be some documentation saying the
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
value is here
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
and because now it's
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
considering being conveyed for this now
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
we know it's below Fair how do you
 
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.930 align:start position:0%
we know it's below Fair how do you
confirm

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
what what it is sure and um thank you if
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
possible I'm likely going to defer that
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
question to dot because I'm I'm sure
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
that they have a process for determining
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
the market value like an appraisal when
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
they go through this process
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
um so I think the intent here again is
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
just it's to add
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
some discretion for the commissioner in
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you know the town
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
does not want the property and there is
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
another transferee
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
and they can come to agreement with DOT
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
um but they are not the municipality
 
00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:05.390 align:start position:0%
um but they are not the municipality
okay

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
if I could of course sure
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
so the process at present so this
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
property we're talking about a specific
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
property so this property is is an old
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
train station is that what this is yes
 
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:23.710 align:start position:0%
train station is that what this is yes
okay

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it's state owned at this point in
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
time or did the state it stayed on the
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
parcel right isn't in Dot's ownership
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so if
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
someone they it was determined that this
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
was going to be disposed of there was
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
someone saying that they wanted this
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
property and they would ask the state to
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
consider selling it goes through a
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
process it has an appraisal
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
groups come forward and say whether they
 
00:24:59.210 --> 00:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
usually don't do that unless there's a
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
group that comes forward and says they
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
want to purchase that
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
and the process would be then first it
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
would be offered to the town it might be
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
and there's a
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
a group of
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
parties that might have the first shot
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
at it and then it would be offered to
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
has there been an appraisal on the
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
property to start with there must have
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
been an appraisal I can ask dot about
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
that I I will let him confirm it I
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
believe I just heard him confirm that
 
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:32.900 align:start position:0%
there would normally be an appraisal yes
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
so I I there's language in here that I'd
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
love to become more comfortable with
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
this because when I first heard the
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
conversation I believe you said that it
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
was for historical or preservation
 
00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:49.789 align:start position:0%
was for historical or preservation
purposes

00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
when I read when I read line four and
 
00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:55.610 align:start position:0%
when I read when I read line four and
five

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
it talks about an overall public
 
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:00.740 align:start position:0%
interest based on historical social
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
environmental or economic benefits
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
or is for a non-proprietary government
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
use that seems like a lot broader
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
language than what I heard the
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
introduction for which was for
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
historical and preservation
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you didn't craft this but
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
you what what can you it seems that if
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
we were to pass this that this is a
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
pretty open book as to
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I know what no idea what social would
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
be is social interest I have no idea
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
what an economic benefit or
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
non-proprietory government use can you
 
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
help me with why that language is such
 
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.289 align:start position:0%
help me with why that language is such
sure

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
um and you're right here I did not craft
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
it although I did add historical into it
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
um the way it came back so I think that
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
we would certainly be open to narrowing
 
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
it the intent here was that if we're you
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
know I think if we're going to go to the
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
trouble of sort of everybody
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the process and creating a
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
carve out that we make sure we capture
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
properties that might have other
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
benefits I I cannot myself really think
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
of other ones you know I think of things
 
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.090 align:start position:0%
of other ones you know I think of things
like

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.750 align:start position:0%
like
um

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth we have the albacore you
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
know like sitting on some land near the
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
highway I don't that probably falls in
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
the category of historical as well but
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's just I think they're sort of
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
examples where you know if D.O.T felt
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
like it would be helpful to have a
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
little bit broader language the narrower
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
then we could keep this and if
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
you guys are not comfortable with it we
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
could narrow it to historical because
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that covers most circumstances
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions at
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
this time yes please represent Melbourne
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
could you tell me the size of the lot
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you tell me the size of
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
further questions and we'll have
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity please represent beggar oh
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
my question sure
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
when we heard this bill before I believe
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was brought up
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
is is it
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
if in fact something happened let's say
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
you did give it to historical did
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
transfer it to the Historical Society
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
they go and they increase the value of
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
the Depot or whatever
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then 10 years from now they go
 
00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
and then 10 years from now they go
defunct

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
defunct
 
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.909 align:start position:0%
defunct
um

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
how do you determine what the value of
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
the property is at that time does it
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
take into consideration
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
you know how things were improved and
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
then how could we uh
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
be assured that we would basically get a
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
get the property back
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
in under what conditions sure I thank
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't think the intent is to make sure
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
that the state can
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
get the property back but I believe and
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
and again I'm gonna have folks that are
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
way closer to this process on a
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis confirmed but my
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
understanding is that you know if the
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
D.O.T were to convey the property it
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
does so subject to Historic preservation
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
covenants and so
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
the deed would be restricted to the uses
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
um that the exception was granted for
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
and so that would factor into the value
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know if the Historical Society
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
receives the property
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
the deed says this property can only be
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
used for historic preservation they
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
improve it they can't just sell it again
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
you know on on the market they sort of
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
they have to act pursuant to the
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
covenants and the deed and so those
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
one second yes follow-up
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair well I guess what I'm
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
getting at more is I'm trying to but
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
yeah and that is is it if 10 years from
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
now let's say the the value of the
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
property is going up they decided they
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
put a lot of money into it but they it's
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
still now is going to Funk
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
How does it go back to the
 
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
to the state and is there any potential
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
claim for that the property's been
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
improved and now therefore
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know as far as trying to settle on
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
the value of the property and there's
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
not a claim that that's been improved
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
and now because you're getting three
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
times as much for it that that they
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
should get some thank you yeah and thank
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
you because your question just prompted
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
again dot can confirm but there's a
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
reversion Clause included in the
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
conveyance from dot so
 
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.730 align:start position:0%
conveyance from dot so
um

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll have to let the assistant
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
administrator speak to the circumstances
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
under which that would take effect but
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
there is a protection for the state for
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
it to come back under certain
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances and we did look at
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
drafting something into this bill last
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
year to accommodate that very
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance and in the end I think at
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
least on the Senate side the legislators
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
were comfortable with what the language
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
dot provided that we didn't need that
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
um so maybe
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
they could he could cover that more
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
detail for you okay thank you okay thank
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
oh no I I apologize I thought my hearing
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
was bad yeah thank you thank you Mr
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I apologize thank you Mr
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
taking my question I want to expand just
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit on the Chairman's
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
questioning uh line five it says or
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
economic benefits could you give me
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
any kind of a specific example of what
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
you would consider an economic benefit
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it's thank you representative for
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
the question it's a good question and I
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know I'm trying to think of
 
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.669 align:start position:0%
you know I'm trying to think of
um

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
an example that would fit one I can
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
think of is for example if there was
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
something that would serve as a tourist
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
attraction you know like if the if it
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily a historical property
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
but rather a parcel that could be
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
conveyed that would bring
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
economic benefits through additional
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
tourism coming to our state I it's not
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
what this is crafted to cover and so
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
again if you guys feel this is too broad
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're certainly open to narrowing it but
 
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
we're certainly open to narrowing it but
um

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
but I I think that's sort of the intent
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
something in the public interest
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
yes we're gonna have an opportunity to
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
speak to others but please go ahead
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
represent Barber
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.049 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
hopefully my last question that's fine
 
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.149 align:start position:0%
hopefully my last question that's fine
um

00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
it was spurred on by the other
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
Representatives question at the town
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
city or county decides to resell the
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
property to show first off for the
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
property to the state at the market
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
value but you stated also that the
 
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
historical society is neither
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
of the above so they would not be a
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
party to that agreement and then they
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
could actually dispose of the property
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
any way they wish after they've received
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
it is that correct so yes and that's
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
um what I was trying to explain to
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar
 
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
um there is there's a reversion class
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
that comes with the conveyance in the
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
deed and I'm going to have to ask dot to
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
speak to this in more detail but
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances the property
 
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
would revert back to the state and
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
um and again
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
we looked at trying to protect the
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
state's interest because it would not
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
fall under lines 14 and 15 in this case
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
and and again this the senators were
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
comfortable we didn't need that but you
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
Sandra thank you thank you guys very
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
much and I'm going to go back to the
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
chamber thanks guys
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to bring forward Adam Smith New
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot perhaps maybe we could
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
and we'll accept your testimony but we'd
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
like to get to the questions that were
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
turn it on again Christian
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
red bun there you go thank you for
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
having me here today
 
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.589 align:start position:0%
having me here today
um

00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm Adam Smith I'm the assistant
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
administrator with the Bureau of
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
right-of-way I'm standing in today for
 
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:48.260 align:start position:0%
Steve Labonte who couldn't be here today
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
the department wishes to remain neutral
 
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:52.580 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
but we're here to provide some general
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
comments and to answer some general
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
questions today
 
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
questions today
um

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
so let me let me start off by saying uh
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
at the January 31st
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
2023 meeting Steve Labonte made a
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
statement uh talking about Dot and the
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau of right-of-way and the the fact
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
is where the Real Estate Group for DOT
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
so we have appraisers we have surveyors
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
we have right-of-way agents and then
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have property managers that are
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for disposals of State
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
interest after projects are built so
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the cleanup or the disposal
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
of Remnant pieces pieces that are no
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
longer needed for Department use at the
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
end of projects
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
so as drafted the proposed legislation
 
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
it would open avenues for the Department
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
to dispose of properties for less than
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
fair market value
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
the exception that is created in this in
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
this RSA 439 C
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
is mirrored after language that's in the
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
code of federal regulations if you want
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
that citation at CFR 23 710 410.
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
and basically that speaks to the exact
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
language that was put into this draft
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
bill which I believe our office our
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
department helped craft some of that
 
00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
department helped craft some of that
language

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
um that speaks to the the social
 
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.710 align:start position:0%
um that speaks to the the social
um

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the social uh piece of that
 
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm looking for the exact
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
language bear with me line five line
 
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.690 align:start position:0%
language bear with me line five line
five

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so the exact language historic
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
social environmental and economic
 
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.190 align:start position:0%
social environmental and economic
benefits

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
um that's directly out of the CFR
 
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.089 align:start position:0%
um that's directly out of the CFR
so

00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:53.099 --> 00:36:55.069 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that real quick
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
another thing that Steve Labonte said at
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
the January 31st meeting hearing was
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
that this legislation if adopted is not
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to be a blank check to sell
 
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
properties for pennies on the dollar we
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
still have a responsibility to balance
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh the Department's specific obligations
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of money that is given
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
obviously for Federal Highway
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
development and if it's not used for
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
that we still owe that money back to the
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway so
 
00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:28.130 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway so
um

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
you know it's got to be used and
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
discretionary so we we want it we want
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
to kind of uh be very careful how this
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
so if the if this bill is passed there
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
are several things that would have to
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
happen for the Department to go forth
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
and actually execute uh selling property
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
less than fair market value one of the
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
first things we'd have to do is we'd
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to amend our right-of-way manual
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
which is which is uh
 
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
it's reviewed every five years it's
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
approved by Federal Highway and
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
basically it's our Playbook of how we do
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
do business for the department and
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
specifically if we're going to be
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
selling property less than fair market
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
value that process and that rationale
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
has to be outlined in the in the
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
right-of-way manual
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
so that would be the first thing we'd
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
um and that's no small that's no small
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
feat we have been working with groups
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire Housing Finance over
 
00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:31.220 align:start position:0%
the last few years to see if there's any
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
agreements on potential language that
 
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:34.940 align:start position:0%
could be used
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
to help with that justification that
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
would be approved by Federal Highway we
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
have reached out to Federal Highway a
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
couple times and gotten some buy-in on
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
on some language so there's there is
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
some groundwork that's been done now the
 
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:53.300 align:start position:0%
specific situation was
 
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:56.900 align:start position:0%
properties that would be suitable for
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development housing not
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily what we were talking about
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
before with the sale of historic
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
um so there are scenarios uh
 
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:15.500 align:start position:0%
where the department could
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
transfer property to third parties uh
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
another scenario we have mitigation
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
properties they either have Wetland
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
mitigation restrictions or historic
 
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.770 align:start position:0%
mitigation restrictions or historic
restrictions

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
and then those are to offset project
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
impacts those are then held by the
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
department the department struggles with
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
being the steward of those properties so
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're always struggling with that so
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we're approached by
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
conservation groups that want to take on
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
those stewardship responsibilities this
 
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislation could help pave the way to
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
transfer a piece of property to a
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
conservation group for those stewardship
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
getting to
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
how we would do it after the
 
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:08.660 align:start position:0%
right-of-way manual would be
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
amended we would still anticipate going
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
to long range we would still obviously
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
go to GNC so the process for disposing
 
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:20.660 align:start position:0%
of surplus land would remain the same
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
and it would still be vetted in multiple
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
layers so I want I just want to
 
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
kind of lay that groundwork that it's
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
not just going to be a blank slate to
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
sell property less than fair market
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
value as many checks many checks and
 
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.770 align:start position:0%
value as many checks many checks and
balances

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:35.780 align:start position:0%
balances
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
on top of that we're going to put
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
covenants and restrictions on the deed
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes a reverter clause is important
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
especially if we're selling something
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
say to a town with historic restrictions
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
that property is sold with those
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
conditions for a very specific purpose
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
so if that purpose no longer
 
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:00.740 align:start position:0%
is needed in the future
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure before it's sold
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
off say for a different purpose that
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
that referter kicks in and that property
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
is offered with a new appraisal back to
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:15.980 align:start position:0%
so in summary the proposed legislation
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
it does offer some management options
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
for disposing of challenging properties
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
but the the the goal is to
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
um make sure that it's in the overall
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
public benefit so
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
with that I'm open for questions
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh if I if you would
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
indulge me to go first here
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
so at present
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
um the is there an appraisal on this
 
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.130 align:start position:0%
um the is there an appraisal on this
property

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes there are a hundred thousand dollar
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
property is this uh yeah
 
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.970 align:start position:0%
property is this uh yeah
um

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
there is an appraisal I'm not sure
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's public information at this time
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh but we have
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh a staff appraiser in the Bureau of
 
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:07.700 align:start position:0%
right away has conducted an appraisal
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
they've valued the property with
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
historic restrictions and without so we
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
actually have two values
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
um obviously without restrictions
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
Garner's a higher value okay so I'm fine
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
with that so
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
at present if if we went through the
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
normal process it would be offered to
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
the town first
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
so if the town what's what's the
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
restriction on what the town would have
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
at present not with this document I have
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
what would the town would the town
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
have to pay market value yes the way the
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
current legislation is is fair market
 
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.510 align:start position:0%
current legislation is is fair market
value

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
so there is no exception as written to
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
that rule so that that even applies to
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
towns so in in the the way it is right
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
now the town could say we want to
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
purchase that property because we must
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have enough who do we have the
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
obligation to on this property is it a
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway or who do we have the
 
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat that who do
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
we have the obligation to pay funds back
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
to for this property when it's sold
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is a hundred percent
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
Turnpike property so the funds will go
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
100 back to turnpikes
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
so let's say your legislation passes the
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
Senators legislation passes
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
the pro the this the commissioner and
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
long range uh come to determination that
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
they're going to sell this for a lesser
 
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.569 align:start position:0%
they're going to sell this for a lesser
value

00:43:41.569 --> 00:43:41.579 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
for some reason that I can't even begin
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
to understand on that explanation I
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
heard for social
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
and then at some point in time as one
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
Representatives mentioned that this use
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
I have a historical society in my town
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
that we turn property over to and then
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
five years later we have it back except
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
now we're spending the money now to
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
bring this property back to a sellable
 
00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:11.210 align:start position:0%
bring this property back to a sellable
feature

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
it would only make sense that there's
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a substantial Improvement
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
made to this property but for some
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
reason some let's say I'll use another
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
word out of here economic reason that
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
use doesn't continue but am I wrong to
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
assume that the that the state has to
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
buy it back then at the market value
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
so in a sense if the worst case scenario
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
happened and the state were to transfer
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
this property over to some entity and at
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
some point in time that entity can't
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
make a go of it and then we're subjected
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
to market value we may end up being
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
buying a property back for more we sold
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
am I missing something there
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey no that's
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
exactly how I read this current
 
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.690 align:start position:0%
exactly how I read this current
legislation

00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
under lines 14 and 15
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
basically it clearly says if the town
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
city county decides to resell the
 
00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
property shall first be offered the
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
property back to the state at the market
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
value at the time of sale so that could
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
be pretty far down the road that could
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
be a much different value at that time
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions yes
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
represent Jack uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh thank you for
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
coming uh if we were to pass line four
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
through nine as it is uh I don't find
 
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
anything in there that uh requires it to
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
follow the existing long-range process
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
as you've said that you would but there
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be anything to require
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
it number two it seems to change the
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
appraisal process from the way we
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
normally do it now that either your
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
department does it or they have an
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
outside appraiser do it to the governor
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and Council determines the fair market
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
value and not the appraisal process that
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
we currently use and I don't see
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
anything in in the language about
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
covenants that requires a reversionary
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
clause and is that your normal what's
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
this what's the authority by which you
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
would add a reversionary clause on a
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good that's a great
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
question representative Jack thank you
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
um right now the authority is to be able
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
to put conditions on the sale to protect
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
the state interest under this current
 
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.089 align:start position:0%
the state interest under this current
statute

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:33.230 align:start position:0%
statute
um

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
and then there's some there's some other
 
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.290 align:start position:0%
and then there's some there's some other
General

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
um statutes that the department uses and
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
I I can't think of those right off the
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
top of my head but they're General
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
enough where we if we feel like there's
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
a a need for caring forth restrictions
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
say it's a mitigation property and
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's covenants that run with the land
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
we would have to offer those with you
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
know as a package deal to whomever wants
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
to purchase those
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah uh represent Faulkner
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to get back to this one thing
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph two does not apply to any I
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
mean by its own wording
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
does not apply to anything that's
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
covered in a paragraph 1A it says except
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
as provided in paragraph 1A so
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
this whole thing about the city having
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
selling it back to the state of market
 
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
selling it back to the state of market
value

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
only applies to paragraph one which is
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
if the city accepts it at full market
 
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.170 align:start position:0%
if the city accepts it at full market
value

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
and anyway paragraph two doesn't require
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
the state to buy it back it just gives
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
it State the you know first option to
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
buy it back
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
if if it's if it's sold to this to the
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
town under paragraph one
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
yeah full market value
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to take it but if it
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
does it's pays full market value at the
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
time that's all that says
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
none of that has anything to do with 1A
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
which is a totally separate category and
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
when a
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
provides for its own resale value
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
through the covenants and restrictions
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
is that the proper reading of this
 
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.250 align:start position:0%
is that the proper reading of this
statute

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Faulkner I believe I
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Newton
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
um could you give me an approximate of
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
how many properties a state owns at this
 
00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:29.030 align:start position:0%
how many properties a state owns at this
law

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
would affect is it one property is it 10
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
is it a hundred is it a thousand pieces
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative Newton that's a great
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
question I don't have the exact number
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
in front of me but it would be
 
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
in front of me but it would be
um

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
it would be a fair number I don't I
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't have an exact number at this time
 
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:53.690 align:start position:0%
don't have an exact number at this time
questions

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
does the state still still get land
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
through imminent domain for the highway
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
in federal and Turnpike
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
projects and is some of that land that's
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
not needed or not used
 
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:11.660 align:start position:0%
does that can that then be sold for
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
economic benefits
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
president Newton yes the answer the
 
00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:19.099 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
one last question it seems to me not too
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
long ago we just passed a constitutional
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that doesn't allow for land to
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
be purchased or taken by imminent domain
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
for economic benefits so how would that
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
apply to our constitution
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you just said that that land can be
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
sold once it's been taken for economic
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
for uh yeah for domain two we sold for
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
economic profit thank you for the
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
question representative and I think I
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question there so uh
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
the first part of your question was does
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
the department acquire land through
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
imminent domain the answer is yes that's
 
00:50:01.089 --> 00:50:01.099 align:start position:0%
for project development Highway purposes
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
when the project is built and whatever
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
remnants are left over after the
 
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
Project's built then there's a separate
 
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
Project's built then there's a separate
process

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we go through in order to determine
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
the market value and the conditions that
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to sell those Surplus
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
properties back to the public so it's
 
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
not always
 
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's not always at an economic gain I
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
guess uh you know especially especially
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
after our project's been built so uh
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're they're Remnant
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
pieces after the project is built yeah
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you represent bogert please
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to go back to after
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
disqualifies is disqualified as of any
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
significant purpose whatsoever based on
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that 1A trumps it and I presume
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
all cells of excess land would then be
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
followed under 1A
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
so with that being said there's no
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
Clauses or anything for for and what
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
I've heard only towns and cities and
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
stuff like that or
 
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
able to sell it back to the state but in
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
this case the one property is
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
is none of the above
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
so how does all that fit
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
with this because
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of confused now between
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
help me to understand please
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a great question
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bogart
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I'm probably the best
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
person to answer that question that's a
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
pretty technical question that I would
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
want to table until we had a chance to
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up on my esteem that
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
this were to uh
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
to pass through the house and to be
 
00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.450 align:start position:0%
to pass through the house and to be
voted

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
then there's a whole nother layer if I
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
heard you correctly then you're going to
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
have to get the feds to agree that
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
um that you have the ability now on a
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
rewrite that you can dispose of
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
properties for less than fair market
 
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.870 align:start position:0%
properties for less than fair market
value

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
and I think you say that you look at
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
that every five years how far how far
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
how many years our years out are we that
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
you normally would have done that
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey that's a great
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
question as well we're about a year four
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
so we're actually in the process of
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
reviewing a right-of-way manual right
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
now and coming up with proposed changes
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
and I I guess this would be something I
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
I tell my committee not to indulge in
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm going to ask you what would
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
this this committee deals on a um on
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
every other year basis uh the highway
 
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.809 align:start position:0%
every other year basis uh the highway
fund

00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we're struggling struggling
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
struggling to pave roads but one of the
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
one of the in bridges and keep the
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure working but but one of
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
our crown jewels to date has been our
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
our Turnpike system is self-funding
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
roads are in good shape and so forth but
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system is under tremendous
 
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.650 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system is under tremendous
um

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
tremendous Peril because a lot of our
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
Turnpike was funded improvements were
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
funded on on tolls and and there's
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
pressure to remove those toll booths off
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
of that and that translates to less of
 
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.089 align:start position:0%
of that and that translates to less of
Revenue

00:54:01.089 --> 00:54:01.099 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
and requires the turnpike system to work
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly from one of
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
one of the conversations here that this
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
may not be a one-off this might be many
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
can the turnpike sustain giving away
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
property for less than market value and
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
and still maintain a system that we
 
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.030 align:start position:0%
and still maintain a system that we
enjoy

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey so first off
 
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.030 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey so first off
um

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
I don't believe if this legislation went
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
through that it would be many properties
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
that would qualify to go through at less
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
than fair market value okay so I really
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't see turnpikes being targeted for
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
I think turnpikes uh you know they have
 
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of properties that are
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
currently being used and there's a high
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
demand for those so even past projects
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh that were
 
00:55:05.819 --> 00:55:09.410 align:start position:0%
uh that were
uh

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
contemplated are still on the books and
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
we know there's a high value for that
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
property so we we're not necessarily
 
00:55:20.569 --> 00:55:20.579 align:start position:0%
open to selling those type of properties
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
at less than fair market value
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for a
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
gentlemen yes representative
 
00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:31.910 align:start position:0%
gentlemen yes representative
yes

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of words
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
that I was thinking but couldn't
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
formulate as well as you did so with
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
with that if I can go back I have this
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
Vision in my head of Union Station in
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
Washington DC okay it's an active
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
railway station it's a Depot it's a main
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
tourist attraction and there are
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants and shops and whatever in
 
00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.329 align:start position:0%
restaurants and shops and whatever in
there

00:55:58.329 --> 00:55:58.339 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
so I don't I cannot visualize this
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
property but it's apparently historical
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
train station
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
probably very well located center of
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
town area and on an acre or so of land
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
so if this legislation passed would that
 
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.309 align:start position:0%
so if this legislation passed would that
prevent

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
just for an example of a developer
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
coming in saying hmm I can keep a facade
 
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
and it will retain its historical value
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
but they or whatever the corporation
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
would be willing to pay a big amount of
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
money for it
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
to put it turn it into for example some
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
kind of housing luxury condos whatever
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
and that money could go into the
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
turnpike system would that
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
all be prohibited if this legislation as
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
representative Newman I'm not sure how
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
to answer that that question that was
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't have an
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
answer right thank you any further
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
questions at this point we have several
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
other cards
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you sir all right thank you

Park boat ramp I apologize we're having
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
a spirited conversation I could see that
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
we could be running a half hour late
 
00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:30.059 align:start position:0%
before we get to you folks
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority and I'm here to
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
express New Hampshire housing support
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
for this legislation as passed by the
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
Senate there have been lots of really
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
good questions here and appreciate Mr
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
Smith's very Adept answers to most of
 
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
them I do want to point out a couple
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
things and this is reflective of some of
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
the questions I've heard from you to
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka and to Mr Smith
 
00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:19.569 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka and to Mr Smith
um

00:58:19.569 --> 00:58:19.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
with regard to line five
 
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:26.420 align:start position:0%
that's the historical social
 
00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
environmental or economic benefits so Mr
 
00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
Mr Smith pointed out that does come from
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
the Federal Highway Administration and
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
he gave you the CFR citation to that I
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
heard Mr chairman you expressed concern
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
about the breadth of that and not
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly what is meant by social
 
00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:47.579 align:start position:0%
and I certainly understand that if you
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
were to seek to limit the scope of this
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
legislation I would strongly encourage
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
you to include
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
affordable housing as a purpose
 
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:01.700 align:start position:0%
for sale by the state
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
of surplus property
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
subject to appropriate covenants under
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
RSA 204d which is a surplus land statute
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing has what effects
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
if is effectively a preemptive right to
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
acquire Surplus property from the state
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
that is we jump ahead of city and town
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
interests when it is for the purpose of
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
development of affordable housing and I
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
think I don't think anyone in this room
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
has hasn't heard that we have an
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis in the state
 
00:59:37.859 --> 00:59:38.450 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis in the state
um

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
so I strongly encourage you to keep that
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
in mind we do have we have an excellent
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
relationship with the department and we
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
have ongoing discussions over uh Surplus
 
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
land that the department intends to
 
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
Surplus and we they give us an
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at those properties
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
and determine whether we New Hampshire
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
housing have an interest in acquiring
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
those properties for the purpose of
 
01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:05.579 align:start position:0%
development of affordable housing
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so it's not we're
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
not talking about one town
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the entire State
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
wherever dot is surplusing property most
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
of the properties we have no interest in
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
because they're just not suitable for
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
affordable housing development they're
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
not suitable for Housing Development
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
period they may be in commercial zones
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
they may be strips of land that only the
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
abutter would be interested in
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
so we're we're highly selective in in
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
choosing properties that we express
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
01:00:38.099 --> 01:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
interest in
um

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
with regard to things like the
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
reversionary clause and that the
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
conditions that the department may put
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
on the transfer of property keep in mind
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
and this has already been said but I
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
want to re-emphasize this this still
 
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
goes through long-range and GNC
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
the department the commissioner does not
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
have the final word on this you
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
effectively do and then followed by GNC
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
um I'll stop there I put in for two
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
minutes but I'd be happy to take any
 
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.870 align:start position:0%
minutes but I'd be happy to take any
questions

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
oh I think we'll take you for more thank
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
you Miss Frost I appreciate you being
 
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.750 align:start position:0%
you Miss Frost I appreciate you being
here

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I will um so at present when
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
properties being disposed of it's your
 
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.030 align:start position:0%
properties being disposed of it's your
understanding

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
um that affordable housing is
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
can make a claim on a property before
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
the town can is that what you said to me
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay and at present if
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
it was determined that this was a
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
project that was agreeable for
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing you would be
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
conditioned presently to pay the market
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
value of that property in most
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
circumstances yes certainly we're uh
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
Highway funds or Turnpike funds are
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
involved that is that is definitely the
 
01:02:02.339 --> 01:02:04.010 align:start position:0%
involved that is that is definitely the
case

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
all right I I understand but if we if
 
01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:09.059 align:start position:0%
you want to add if if someone wanted to
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
add you in the list for getting for less
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
than market value you'd be happy with
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
that also is that what you well we we
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
would because uh to develop
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
affordable housing on land that is
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
acquired at full fair market value is
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
difficult if not in some cases
 
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.710 align:start position:0%
difficult if not in some cases
impossible

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.390 align:start position:0%
impossible
the

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
ability of the commissioner in effect to
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate with New Hampshire housing on
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
what a discount might be appropriate
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the property would then
 
01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:45.020 align:start position:0%
be used for affordable housing with
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
long-term restrictions on the use
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh then I'd say that that is a in effect
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
a social good
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
and if I could I would imagine you've
 
01:02:56.339 --> 01:03:01.730 align:start position:0%
and if I could I would imagine you've
probably

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
how many units of affordable housing do
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
you think that this is possible to um
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
renovate do whatever and would you would
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
you be would someone that wanted to
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to make affordable housing there
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman those are two separate
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
and distinct questions I'll address the
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
first one to the extent I'm able
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
we don't know all um
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's a I assume I assume a public
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
listing of state-owned properties yes
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
there is but it's many thousands of
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
properties and most of them uh we would
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
have no interest in
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh there are some parcels of land that
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
dot currently owns or controls on behalf
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
of the State uh that would be really
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
suitable for affordable housing
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
development and it might be on a
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
particular parcel it might be 50 units
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
it might be 100 units it might be 20
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
units it really depends upon the
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
individual parcel I'm speaking of this
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
this this piece of legislation is
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
starting out as a targeted piece of
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
legislation for the for the disposal of
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
one piece of property in this town I'm
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
speaking of that property is it I I have
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
no knowledge of that parsley okay thank
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that uh questions
 
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.730 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that uh questions
response

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
dot has oversight of property is it the
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
property that's already been paid for or
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
is it property that has been bonded
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
sold or purchased via bonds and stuff so
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
that the state is still paying for this
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
land and then
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
sell it for less than what we are paying
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
for it if we're still paying for it it's
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
kind of like a multi-level question
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
there representative I assume we're not
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the individual parcel in
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
just the town of Newington Newington no
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not because this is this is more
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
General than one piece of property so
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
asking my understanding is that this is
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
only that is the the statutes we're
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
talking about uh this RSA 439c RSA 440
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
which is the general surplusing of land
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
statute that deals with properties that
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
are already owned in fee by the state uh
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're not sub they're not a purchase
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
and sale agreement it's not a not a
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
condition of acquisition it's property
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
that are already owned by the state and
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
hence that's that's where the the
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
surplusing the concept of surplusing
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
they are deemed to be Surplus for the
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you any further question
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to bring
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
um Lulu Pickering am I correct about
 
01:06:09.359 --> 01:06:10.670 align:start position:0%
um Lulu Pickering am I correct about
that

01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
please come forward Newington Historical
 
01:06:13.079 --> 01:06:25.490 align:start position:0%
please come forward Newington Historical
Society

01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
I haven't done a pink card yet but I
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
thought it might be a little if you if
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
you could afterwards please and Ladies
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
If you could do your best to if if
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
something's already been um
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh spoke of or to contain I'd love to
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
hear everything you have to say but if
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
you can contain the conversation some I
 
01:06:47.049 --> 01:06:47.059 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
welcome to public works thank you very
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
much and I won't go through the uh
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
information that I put online under the
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
remote because I think there were so
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
many questions today and I've been
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
involved in this process for five years
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
so I can help give you some information
 
01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:11.420 align:start position:0%
that I think will be very helpful
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not meant to just be
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the Newington railroad Depot the
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
reason we're here is we ran into a
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
particular state law that became very
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
difficult for us and so he said well
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
everybody shouldn't have to run into
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
this brick wall if there's a reason to
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
amend the law then we should do it so
 
01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
all of the non-profits benefit
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
the questions about the language and the
 
01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
you're right the very top of this
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
language is an exception it doesn't
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
modify all of the other ways that
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
property are declared to be Surplus it
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
does not modify whatever the long-range
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission does it does not
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
modify anybody's Authority on State
 
01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059 align:start position:0%
properties for the market value that's
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
not what we're trying to do
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say that in certain
 
01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.090 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say that in certain
circumstances

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:16.100 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
exceptions should apply
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
now I think it could help you a lot to
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
understand how we got into the situation
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're in today
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
this property has been owned by the
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for well over 70
 
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:33.470 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for well over 70
years

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
it was taken by eminent domain when the
 
01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
general Sullivan Bridge was built so
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
what the state wanted to do
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'll try to talk into the microphone I'm
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
sorry did you say seven years or 70. 70
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
it has been owned for 70 years
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
what the state said it would do when it
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
took the property by eminent domain was
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
it was going to create a public park on
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
the Newington side of the bridge and
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
then it created Hilton park on the Dover
 
01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
side of the bridge Hilton Park got
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
created the Newington Park never got
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
created that's what the Newington
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
Historical Society wants to do
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
now the property itself is state-owned
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
property by state rules and laws it's
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
supposed to be maintained it's in
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
deplorable condition
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
now everybody knows money's tight
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
Highway turnpikes they have a lot of red
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
listed Bridges they have to decide how
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
do they prioritize their money
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
well historic preservations not high on
 
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
that list
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
and so the next thing I'd like to say
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
is when we came to the general Sullivan
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
bridge and this massive expansion of the
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
highway through Newington through Dover
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
and on the bridge
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
the Federal Highway the state the DOT
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
said that they were going to preserve
 
01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:14.660 align:start position:0%
the federal the general Sullivan bridge
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
for its historic value
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
as mitigation of all of the other
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
impacts that the highway was having on
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
our area
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
they didn't
 
01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
they allowed the bridge to further
 
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
deteriorate they came back 15 years
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
later and said now we want to destroy
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
the bridge
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
so now we have two properties state or
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
or Highway owned properties
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be maintained were not
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
maintained and we like historic
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
preservation we want to preserve one of
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
the oldest Parts in the whole state of
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
for public use
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
so we go through a long and protracted
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
section 106 process
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
the language that you see at the
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
beginning of this bill that talks about
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
I mean it's the questions you've had
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh that talks about
 
01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:22.580 align:start position:0%
what are these historical social
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
environmental or economic benefits
 
01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:29.540 align:start position:0%
all of that language comes out of every
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
environmental impact study that the
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
highway has to do on any project that it
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
has it is an integral part of the
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
section 106 process of how do you then
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
mitigate an adverse impact on a historic
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
structure so we're not trying to coin
 
01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
new phrases we're trying to say work
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the language that everybody
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
understands that they're routinely doing
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
these studies anyway so that they can
 
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
so the end of the section 106 process
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
now the state and Dot want to destroy
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
the general Sullivan Bridge
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
we were successful in saying if you do
 
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.169 align:start position:0%
we were successful in saying if you do
that

01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
we want you to help preserve the
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
railroad Depot property which you have
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
owned for 70 years and done nothing with
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
it was a difficult negotiation to get
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
through that process is not easy
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
but we got through the process
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
and the property was go it was assessed
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
it was determined to be Surplus property
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
it went through the whole long-range
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission plant system
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
so it was decided yes this is Surplus
 
01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
property we can use it as a mitigation
 
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
factor for the general Sullivan Bridge
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
so the offer after four years of very
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
hard work
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
the property would be transferred at no
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
cost to the town of Newington
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
it would come with a hundred and fifty
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars because the building
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
has left rotting in place with very
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
little maintenance
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
it would come with a building assessment
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
to say here's the priority things that
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
you have to remedy on the building in
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
the approximate cost
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it would come with a land survey
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
that shows where all of the shoreline
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
setback things are where the evasive
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
species are all of that was the offer
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
now for the first two years the town
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen were very much on board very
 
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.370 align:start position:0%
Selectmen were very much on board very
encouraging

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
encouraging
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
but Selectmen change constantly
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
we now in the last three years have
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
three new Selectmen on a three Selectmen
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
board we've had four new Selectmen in
 
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
six years
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
their priorities change
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
but what we heard from them and this is
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
not unique to us
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
well we heard from them is we have too
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
many historic properties already we
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
don't need another one
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's happening all across the state of
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's not unique to us
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
so if the public entities
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to work with the properties
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
to fix them
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
the state didn't D.O.T didn't Federal
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
Highway did not
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
the town says it's more than we can
 
01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:57.770 align:start position:0%
the town says it's more than we can
handle

01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
handle
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
but you do have non-profit organizations
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
who are public
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
organ they're public in a sense they
 
01:15:11.169 --> 01:15:11.179 align:start position:0%
provide public benefit to the people
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
we're a private organization because
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
we're Incorporated
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
but you can't be a 501c3 organization
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
unless you have a public aspect to what
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
we want to preserve the building it will
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
come with a whole series of preservation
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
restrictions it's a historic building we
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
will have to satisfy all of the
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
Secretary of the Interior standards for
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
how you deal with the historic building
 
01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
we already have been working with
 
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:50.060 align:start position:0%
fundraising with Grant organizations
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
working with groups like The New
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire preservation Alliance
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
we want to do this
 
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
but the only thing standing in our way
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
to do something that the state has not
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
done for 70 years
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
D.O.T doesn't want to preserve historic
 
01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.290 align:start position:0%
D.O.T doesn't want to preserve historic
properties

01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
the only thing standing in our way is
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
what the exception to this bill is
 
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to solve
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
the language that says that the property
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
can only be transferred to the public
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
entity the
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
County the town or the city completely
 
01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:37.820 align:start position:0%
bars us as a non-profit organization
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
from accepting what is a beautiful offer
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we've worked five years through
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
section 106 process to bring to the
 
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.610 align:start position:0%
section 106 process to bring to the
table

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
so we were told no if the town doesn't
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
want it you can't have it we have to
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
sell it
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
now I think if we want to preserve
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire we want to help
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
with a budget we want to help with the
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
highway we want to help with all of the
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges but we also have to do
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
what we can for all of these cultural
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
social historic housing the things that
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
benefit people we need to do those too
 
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess I'll say that's my
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
rant I thank you for listening to me but
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to answer any questions
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
and Jennifer is maybe I could just give
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
30 seconds and then turn it back to Lulu
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions so for the
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
record I'm Jennifer Goodman the
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
preservation Alliance
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
um so just wanted to offer a Statewide
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
perspective from a non-profit historic
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
preservation group uh really encourage
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
your support of this exception so that
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
properties like the one that um Lulu
 
01:18:04.209 --> 01:18:04.219 align:start position:0%
Pickering just described could be helped
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
kind of knitting together what other
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
people have said I think these are
 
01:18:11.689 --> 01:18:11.699 align:start position:0%
Surplus properties kind of the orphans
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
in the system and there will be a a
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
special group where there's
 
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the right kind of actor the right
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
kind of non-profit if this exception
 
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
moves forward the right kind of property
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
that will even seek this kind of
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
exception and then as others have said
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
before me there'll be a very rigorous
 
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
process to evaluate rather that
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
exception can be made what the value is
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
and these restrictions that will run
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
with the property into the future
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
um I can think of I don't have an
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
inventory for you but I can certainly I
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
I welcomed Mr Smith's comments about
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
properties like this Newington Depot
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
that have been kind of left stranded
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
after a mitigation process where they
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
were saved as part of this mitigation
 
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
process for the public benefit but then
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
they haven't been stewarded because it's
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
sort of not in the Wheelhouse for the
 
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.850 align:start position:0%
sort of not in the Wheelhouse for the
state

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so I can think of some other historic
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of historic Farms over my 20
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
years at the historic preservation
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
organization that would have benefited
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
from this kind of exception where a
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
willing non-profit could have stepped up
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
and and made that kind of investment and
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefited the community around it
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
um so again just there's there's
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
certainly always going to be pressures
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
to keep the coffers as full as possible
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
in those Highway funds I think this is a
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
unique group of properties that if this
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
exception would go forward would really
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
benefit the communities that they stand
 
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.890 align:start position:0%
benefit the communities that they stand
in

01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:44.900 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
and as you know I think
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
non-profits in some cases are often very
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
well positioned to take on this kind of
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
effort they have a narrower focus a
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
narrower Mission what better position
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
with the right kind of expertise and
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
access to philanthropic or other dollars
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
to make these kind of a win-win
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
situation so I just wanted to offer that
 
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.590 align:start position:0%
situation so I just wanted to offer that
context

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
we're live thank you
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
um man Pickering thee did I did I hear
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
you say that a number of years ago an
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
agreement was reached with DOT to
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the um some of the um
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
closing from the the general Sutherland
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
Bridge which is a near and dear property
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
yeah they
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
and that the the dot was going to turn
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
that over to the town of Newington for a
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
dollar or for zero funds and if that was
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
the case why didn't your folks step
 
01:21:57.610 --> 01:21:57.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:00.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's two different processes that
 
01:22:09.649 --> 01:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
took place in 2007 when the first work
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
started on the expanding the highway the
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
Spalding Turnpike and the bridges
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
there was a section 106 process that was
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
done and the conclusion of that process
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
was that the state
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
dot Federal Highway were supposed to
 
01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
save the general Sullivan Bridge so that
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
it could be used for this
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
recreational people access across the
 
01:22:39.719 --> 01:22:41.149 align:start position:0%
recreational people access across the
river

01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
river
 
01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
then you have to fast forward about 10
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
15 years and they came back with a
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
supplemental environmental in Impact
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
statement that said no it's too
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
expensive now way too expensive we can't
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
when we started the section 106 process
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
it will show us what you did to maintain
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
that bridge in the 12 15 years that you
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
were supposed to maintain it and almost
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
nothing happened
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
and I think the reasoning is why put
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
money into an old bridge if you let it
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
sit there long enough you can make a
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
valid argument that it costs too much to
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
now is that good or bad I don't know but
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's how the system works I understand
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
that I understand that and uh this
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee's been very involved to
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
discontinue that bridge I understand the
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
but I thought there was mention at some
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
point that the town through the Federal
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
Highway and through D.O.T had offered
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
that property to the town for a dollar
 
01:23:57.370 --> 01:23:57.380 align:start position:0%
did I hear something
 
01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
no with a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
dollars to help you preserve it why
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
didn't why didn't the town take it then
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
when they were in agreement and then
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
turn it over to you folks then
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have actually made the request both
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
to the town of Newington and to the DOT
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
to say if you if neither one of you want
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
to maintain and preserve this property
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
and the Historic Society does
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
will you accept it and turn it over to
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
us give us all of the responsibility to
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
maintain the property and they said no
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
the town said no because they thought
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
that well you can still come to town
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
meeting and ask the townspeople to help
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
you fund it that was one of the things I
 
01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.130 align:start position:0%
you fund it that was one of the things I
heard

01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:48.140 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
the planning board didn't want to
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
because it's like hey if it goes into
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
private hands you can the question about
 
01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
can you get more property taxes from a
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
private owner that could develop it into
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
something yes so there's a financial
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
incentive not to preserve a historic
 
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:11.649 align:start position:0%
incentive not to preserve a historic
property

01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:11.659 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
dot said no we said well if the town
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
won't transfer it to the Historic
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
Society will you lease it to us long
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
term with all of the responsibility and
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the answer we got to that is that
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
they're already so far down this process
 
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to have to
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
backtrack on it
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to narrow my my
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
question back too
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're at one point dot in Co-op if I'm
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
wrong with the blessing of the federal
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh Highway was would have given the
 
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
property to the town for zero and giving
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
you a hundred given the town a hundred
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars to to help uh
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
renovate or whatever to preserve that
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
property did the town say no to that
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
the official offer has not been made but
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
over the last two years as we've gone
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
through this process the memorandum of
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
understanding the section 106 process
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
there came a point in time when the town
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
was like no we're not going to accept it
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'll come back and sdot
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
are there are there other questions for
 
01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.790 align:start position:0%
are there are there other questions for
uh

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

so could do you have any knowledge or
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
can you get back to us on on that
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
question that the the feds and Dot had
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
made an offer to the town we were
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
hearing mitigation for other things do
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to that or can you
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%

makagi I'll get back to you I don't know
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
the exact answer on that thank you we'll
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll probably suspend and so
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
we can get that but while while we're
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
here I would like to hear from the last
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
speaker if I could
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%

um Newington New Hampshire representing
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Gilbert welcome to public works thank
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
you my name is William Gilbert I'm from
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
Newington I'm a member of the Newington
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
Historical Society uh not really an
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
officer but I do a lot of the heavy
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
lifting because of my young age I guess
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
um Miss Pickering did a great job of
 
01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.970 align:start position:0%
um Miss Pickering did a great job of
outlining

01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
outlining
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh the legal steps that were taken
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to tell you about what what
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
the humans felt at the time uh and I
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize that we're not here
 
01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
just for newington's railroad station
 
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're here to try to help other
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
historical societies to not have to go
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
through what we went through this is
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
what we went through
 
01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.590 align:start position:0%
what we went through
um

01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
sort of pre-covid 2018-2019 there was a
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
lot of enthusiasm we said hey we're
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
gonna we can get this train depot which
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
is very very small building by the way
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh and it was in mitigation because
 
01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to do something with the
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
general Sullivan Bridge a lot of ideas
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
were being thrown out it's like hey
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get some girders and build
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
a little Monument to it with a plaque
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
describing the purpose of the general
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
Sullivan Bridge the history uh maybe you
 
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
know a great place to hold a wedding uh
 
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:56.219 align:start position:0%
we have lots of archives in the
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
Newington Historical Society about the
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
railroad Depot we could maybe make a
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
little Railroad Museum on the first
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
floor uh who knows maybe a little
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
caretaker up above that could you know
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
take care of the lawns in exchange for
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
for rent and things were going great
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
under Ms pickering's uh tutelage they
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
were memorized by standing the select
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
board at the time was very supportive of
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
her uh and then comes the spring of 2021
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
and our three-man board as she said
 
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
turns over we so we had a new selectman
 
01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
and in April uh we we were going to have
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
a meeting and we thought it was going to
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
be a great done deal we had our State
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
Rep was there we had a representative
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
from DHR was there and we might have had
 
01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
someone from the preservationist and
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
last but I'm not sure uh but at that
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
meeting we thought it was going to be
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to vote Yes and we got
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
a uniform we don't want this property
 
01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
don't pursue it any further there was
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
talk of oh Shoreline mitigation fear
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
factors going on there
 
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
to say we were
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
surprised non-plussed and shocked it was
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
an understatement and that event that
 
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
happened to us that is the Genesis of SB

this bill out and if that's okay with
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%

Waters um welcome to public works I'm

sorry for the delay that you had to
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
endure but I would like to open up the
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 228 FN relative
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
to Hilton Park boat ramp please sir
 
01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters district
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
for introducing Senate Bill 228 relative
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
to the Hilton Park boat Ram so we're now
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
Crossing about a half a mile across
 
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
Hilton point from Newington over to
 
01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.169 align:start position:0%
Hilton point from Newington over to
Dover

01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
Dover
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill tries to address is
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
the deteriorating condition of the boat
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
ramp and the absence of a dock where
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
there used to be one in Hilton Park
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
and um their the condition there is that
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
the boat ramp itself
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
um potholes deterioration of pavement so
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's all about unusable now
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
and then years ago there used to be a
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
dock there so that boats could come in
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
and tie up at the dock people could fish
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
from it and and so on and that dock um
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
deteriorated and was taken down a number
 
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
of years ago now the concerns around um
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
this is to be good to have a launching
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
place there
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of a public
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
launching place in the Great Bay it's
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
either something around here you go to
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
go down all the way down to new Fields
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh down there so there's real interest
 
01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.590 align:start position:0%
uh down there so there's real interest
in

01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
um serving Boulders and Fishers in this
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and a number of years ago we tried to
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
do something about this
 
01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
um at during the time when the
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
construction was beginning on all the
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
bridges down there
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
um Dover had a particular interest at
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
that point too and being able to get its
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
um rescue boat that it would have a
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
place that it might be able to come into
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
a dock and offload somebody onto an
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
ambulance we also headed that time just
 
01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:16.139 align:start position:0%
the beginnings of development
 
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
aquaculture industry and uh the folks up
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
in that part of the bay thought it'd be
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
very nice to be able to bring their
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
boats in somewhere
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
um as as well but because of the
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
construction project we just had to put
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
that on on pause because there was so
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
much else going on there and most of the
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
park was taken up with construction uh
 
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:37.340 align:start position:0%
project so um that's why we began to
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
re-initiate these discussions this uh
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
this past year about okay now what what
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
can we do here
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the reason we're coming before you
 
01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
with this bill to create this committee
 
01:42:49.609 --> 01:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
is there some issues which I'll describe
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so the bill says okay we need a
 
01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee that can come together and
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues so we'll see if we
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
can't get
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
um the boat ramp repaired and
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
potentially construction of a dock
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
the issues here um are is that that land
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
is owned by the Department of
 
01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.290 align:start position:0%
is owned by the Department of
Transportation

01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Transportation
 
01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
under its Federal
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
requirements must sell this land at full
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
market value and a number of years ago
 
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
we had an appraisal you know a million
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
or so dollars for that fine you know
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the law that's what that's
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
what would need to be done
 
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
so to whom Would It Go
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
well fish and game because they operate
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
the boat ramps around the state
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
to two problems with that
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
one is that a fishing game owns it and
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
operates it there cannot be commercial
 
01:43:42.719 --> 01:43:44.090 align:start position:0%
operates it there cannot be commercial
activities

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
so the aquaculture folks couldn't use it
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
the gondola
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't tie up there on the dock either
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
the second problem of Fish and Game runs
 
01:43:54.659 --> 01:43:55.310 align:start position:0%
the second problem of Fish and Game runs
it

01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:43:57.179 --> 01:43:58.129 align:start position:0%
is that
um

01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
they under their rules for boat ramps
 
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
would have to ban parking aside from
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
that of the trailers that are being
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
brought in in that area and they would
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to have someone staff that boat
 
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.550 align:start position:0%
have to have someone staff that boat
ramp

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
ramp
 
01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
ramp
so

01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and then add to that is we'd need a
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
couple million dollars maybe maybe more
 
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
to build to build the um
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
build the dock the ramp repairs not so
 
01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.050 align:start position:0%
build the dock the ramp repairs not so
much

01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.250 align:start position:0%
much
so

01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
it turns out as well though that this is
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
kind of timely because there is federal
 
01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.370 align:start position:0%
kind of timely because there is federal
funding

01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
um the federal delegation has been been
 
01:44:41.290 --> 01:44:41.300 align:start position:0%
contacted there is federal funding for
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh Waterfront projects Coastal projects
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
in various bills at this point in time
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
so the potential is there that the money
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
to buy it
 
01:44:52.250 --> 01:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
and then the money to construct the dock
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
could be secured through federal grants
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
so what this envisions is a committee
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
that will see if there is a way forward
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem of the transfer of
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
and the management of it
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
one possibility that has emerged is that
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
peace Development Authority has said
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
well we might be willing to take on the
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
management of this
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
and that would mean that fish and Gabe
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to staff it that we
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the parking prohibitions
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
and that the agriculture folks could
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
potentially use that dock now so there's
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
the possibilities if we have the
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee get together put together a
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
report look at these things then we'll
 
01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:36.470 align:start position:0%
report look at these things then we'll
see

01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
what is what might be possible for it
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Senator
 
01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:49.070 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Senator
representing

01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually I got a couple Mr chairman the
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
first one is
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
something that we do with on both sides
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
of the wall with the study requests it's
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh says that the studies shall include
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
representatives of the aquaculture
 
01:46:03.119 --> 01:46:04.310 align:start position:0%
representatives of the aquaculture
community

01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh but below that it says other
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
interested parties do you have objection
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
to removing representatives of the
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
agriculture Community I ask that because
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
every time when we put in a nebulous
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
thing into the bill like representatives
 
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
of the aquaculture committee our staff
 
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
spends days if not weeks tracking down
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
who what how it should be and it just
 
01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.930 align:start position:0%
who what how it should be and it just
complicates

01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
complicates
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I've avoided
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
that problem because no it's not setting
 
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
up a committee with members it says at
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
this point it's it's consultation with
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
those folks so they would have to not
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
have to ask folks to be members of this
 
01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.390 align:start position:0%
have to ask folks to be members of this
group

01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's just I'm listening to folks that
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
they would cons they would consult with
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
bringing to talk with them so that's why
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
online you see on on the line
 
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:52.669 align:start position:0%
online you see on on the line
um

01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
consultation on line 10. and that's what
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
governs these other folks so you're
 
01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
going to have Dot and uh fish and game
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
get together and PDA and then they'll
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
consult with the other folks listed on
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
line 10 on so it avoids the problem
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and a follow-up
 
01:47:10.129 --> 01:47:10.139 align:start position:0%
place and
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
can you tell me any other boat ramp in
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that fishing
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
um go up to the Lakes
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how actively this this
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
staff to one down in in new Fields um
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
but they said in this but they said in
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
this particular place because of the
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
nature of that parking
 
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
situation they felt they would have to
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
have somebody there to enforce the no
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
parking by others that's just what they
 
01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:40.790 align:start position:0%
parking by others that's just what they
said

01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.169 align:start position:0%
said
so

01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
if if I could
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
so it's been a number of years since I
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
was at that property used to stop there
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
um is and I remember the boat ramp and I
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
think I even possibly remember a doc
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
the is the ramp still in operation but
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
in poor condition is that what your
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
testimony was or they stopped using the
 
01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.470 align:start position:0%
testimony was or they stopped using the
uh

01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.750 align:start position:0%
uh
the ramp

01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
the ramp
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question I I look at
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
that ramp and um you know
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think would be very
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
sketchy as to whether it really could be
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
very well used I imagine that people
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
could try but they're not actively it is
 
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
it is in tough shape it's in tough shape
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:42.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
um

01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
so we're not we're not forming a
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
commission that makes I I will be happy
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
to take more comment we're not forming a
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
commission you want to form a study
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
and the study is I understand it would
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
be dot fish and game NPS Authority
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then your your you would hold public
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
hearings to that effect
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
and other people that were interested
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
public wanted to attend would have that
 
01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.530 align:start position:0%
public wanted to attend would have that
opportunity

01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.689 align:start position:0%
opportunity
okay

01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
I understand that any any further
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator yes
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Newton thank you Mr
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
question uh this study committee that
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
you want to form to do the Hilton Park
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
and you say there'd be public hearings
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
but those public hearings you imagine
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
them being Statewide or just on the
 
01:49:37.739 --> 01:49:39.410 align:start position:0%
them being Statewide or just on the
Seacoast

01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
Seacoast
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question let me
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
just note it doesn't say a study
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee it says these these three
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
shall study
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
um it is a less formal take
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
but that they should organize a process
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
where anybody who wants to come in
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
and they would consult with and so I
 
01:50:00.590 --> 01:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
would think that would be a fairly open
 
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.570 align:start position:0%
would think that would be a fairly open
process

01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
um since there will be no apps they will
 
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
report to us
 
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
if there were then a proposal to do
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
something I would think at that point we
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
would have a full public hearing
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
process but for this it's like
 
01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
please get together and see if you can't
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
work work something out that you can
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
present to us and then the legislature
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so I apologize for saying uh
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
study committee that's what it appears
 
01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
to me but it does say and here shall
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
provide opportunity for public endpoint
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
and where do you see that public input
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
happening is that what you just
 
01:50:40.679 --> 01:50:42.830 align:start position:0%
happening is that what you just
explained

01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
explained
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
well let's answer the question and you
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
know I I would think that they would uh
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
hold meetings probably
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
um you know either uh Dover city hall or
 
01:50:54.169 --> 01:50:54.179 align:start position:0%
over at uh PDA but if you would feel
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
more comfortable in including language
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
um opportunity for a public hearing
 
01:51:05.050 --> 01:51:05.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
are you all set there yes afternoon yes
 
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.139 align:start position:0%
represent uh Faulkner
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator uh
 
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
the results of the study if they in fact
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
recommend some improvement would you
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we might see that next
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget process or
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.129 --> 01:51:34.139 align:start position:0%
I give them until 2024 June 30th
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
so they've got a year
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
and that does kind of Tee It Up for the
 
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
following legislative section session in
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
which there would be legislative
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
possibilities but also capital budget
 
01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:46.850 align:start position:0%
possibilities but also capital budget
possibilities

01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that on this one
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
that if it looks like the federal
 
01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
funding is there
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
then legislation could say that we
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
authorize dot to make the appropriate
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
transfer at market value Etc
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.370 align:start position:0%
and then
um

01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the Federal grant you know
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
paid for by Federal grant funding
 
01:52:14.209 --> 01:52:14.219 align:start position:0%
something some line like that and so
 
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
that my hope is it would not have
 
01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.290 align:start position:0%
that my hope is it would not have
budgetary

01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:17.300 align:start position:0%
budgetary
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
costs to the state but that that just
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
remains to be determined
 
01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:25.850 align:start position:0%
remains to be determined
representative

01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question pull
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
that a little closer to you if you could
 
01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:33.770 align:start position:0%
that a little closer to you if you could
representative

01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'd love to buy this guy in the world
 
01:52:39.649 --> 01:52:39.659 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious
 
01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
are we voting
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
to build the stock are we voting to
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
study it
 
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question you're voting
 
01:52:48.490 --> 01:52:48.500 align:start position:0%
to tell
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
peas D.O.T and fishing game to study to
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
talk to people and give us a report oh
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
because up here it says this build
 
01:52:59.330 --> 01:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
Direction Department of Fish and Game
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
and Department service station to
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
construct the boat ramp at Hilton Park
 
01:53:03.239 --> 01:53:05.930 align:start position:0%
construct the boat ramp at Hilton Park
condoba

01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
condoba
 
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I asked the question
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
um they shall study it I think May are
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
you looking at the as amended or the
 
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
original it doesn't say study it's a
 
01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:15.070 align:start position:0%
original it doesn't say study it's a
build

01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
build
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
oh well that's I'm sorry thanks for
 
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for pointing it out
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
that analysis referred to the unamended
 
01:53:22.619 --> 01:53:24.050 align:start position:0%
that analysis referred to the unamended
version

01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
the the original version of the Senate
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
said darn it do the doc and that wasn't
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
going to fly because of the problems I
 
01:53:34.129 --> 01:53:34.139 align:start position:0%
noted about authority over the property
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
and management of it so that's why the
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
replace all Amendment said stay
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
but thank you I I had looked at that
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
before I came in and said oh yeah yeah
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
that's the old one and I'm glad you
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
pointed out because I can see why the
 
01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Senator so the goal
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
would the goal
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
to con to study or to study the
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
feasibility of constructing the dock and
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
then ultimately
 
01:54:09.649 --> 01:54:09.659 align:start position:0%
transferring the property to maybe P's
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
Development Authority is that correct to
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
manage it thank you I mean that's that's
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
that would be that is the possibility
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
that came forward that would solve the
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
problems about ownership transfer and so
 
01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
problems about ownership transfer and so
forth

01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's why the bill said you
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
know that's what includes peas because
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
they came forward and said you know what
 
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
we we uh maybe we could maybe run this
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
um because they do that kind of thing
 
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
and they're just across the water
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
um so that when that offer came forward
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
said okay let's study let's let's study
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
and see if that if that is a viable
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
option and we'll find out from this
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
study I think they'll probably look at
 
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
some cost estimates they'll look more
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
closely at the finance available from
 
01:54:57.530 --> 01:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
the federal grants and they'll they'll
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
let us know what what uh what we can do
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh and I understand we have another pink
 
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
card in the audience if you could get
 
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
that passed along so I can see who's
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
looking to speak and what Andy uh
 
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
Senator I'm almost done here
 
01:55:21.609 --> 01:55:21.619 align:start position:0%
and uh representative
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
showcased an item of
 
01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.310 align:start position:0%
showcased an item of
um

01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
qualifications to be a member of this uh
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
a member of this group they have you had
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
conversations with peas Fish and Game
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and are are they are they amicable to
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
doing this yes okay yeah this thanks for
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
the question this amendment
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
um came out of
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
those conversations that fish and game
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
D.O.T thought yeah we would it would be
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
good to do something there they said yes
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a lot of
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
conversation getting to this point and
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh they said yes this is a good way to
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
go because without without appointments
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
and so forth it seems like uh those
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
those people could get together to have
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
this study without this but I fully
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
understand that if we put this in
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
legislation and you were able to find a
 
01:56:18.530 --> 01:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
way for uh Federal funding or whatever
 
01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
it would hold much more Merit in your
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
process and going forward thank you yeah
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
so so I I commend you on that and I mean
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
so you know how it is sometimes it is
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation this is a light touch
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is a very light touch but it is
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
probably the only way to get this done
 
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony sander
 
01:56:43.450 --> 01:56:43.460 align:start position:0%

um chairman McConkey members of the
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee Kathy Mulcahy hamson I'm the
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
senior hearings examiner for the
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation my honor to
 
01:57:12.129 --> 01:57:12.139 align:start position:0%
appear before you this afternoon
 
01:57:17.089 --> 01:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
the Hilton Park boat ramp area is owned
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
by turnpikes
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'd refer to it for DOT anyway as
 
01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
a pro a problem
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
um property
 
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:28.729 align:start position:0%
um property
beautiful

01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
waterfront property is a problem for us
 
01:57:34.930 --> 01:57:34.940 align:start position:0%
because it's not what we do
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
they want to construct a boat ramp and a
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
dock and again not what D.O.T does we
 
01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
would like to see another entity that is
 
01:57:49.609 --> 01:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
better equipped to manage the property
 
01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
take it over and have it for good public
 
01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.030 align:start position:0%
take it over and have it for good public
use

01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
which we're not able to do we want an
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
entity that can be a good Steward of the
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
property and make that work for the
 
01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:05.570 align:start position:0%
property and make that work for the
public

01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:08.219 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work in with the other
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
agencies and entities to look at
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
transferring this property I don't know
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we'd have a lot to say about the
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
construction of the doc facility had a
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
best construct that and the funds for
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
that but we're happy to look at the best
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
ways to transfer that over to another
 
01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
entity that can make better use of the
 
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
entity that can make better use of the
property

01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
yes represent Jack uh thank you uh am I
 
01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
correct because this is Turnpike owned
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be any issue of
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
having to return something to Federal
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
Highway yeah
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
a return to Federal Highway on this
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
good question anyone else yes
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Newton
 
01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:58:52.129 --> 01:58:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
with this project and I'm wondering
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
conceptual plans and ideas and
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
feasibility studies sometimes come with
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
a large cost
 
01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
how much of that can be done
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
in-house and you know thousands and
 
01:59:14.689 --> 01:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars is going to have to
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
be spent for this study I call a study
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
committee to go anywhere where's that
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
money coming from
 
01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
um so it's not within Dot's wheelhouse
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
to um do feasibility studies on
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
construction of the dock or anything or
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
the fishing facilities that that's not
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
what we do so I imagine that would be
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
with fish and game or peas that isn't
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
what we do what I envision our role on
 
01:59:39.050 --> 01:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
studying the issues would be to how best
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
to turn over the property to whichever
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
entity is going to take it over
 
01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:59:52.609 --> 01:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
um is it Elizabeth Fisher
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
is this a preferred order between the
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
welcome to public works when you're
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
ready to speak just make sure the
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
red light is on by depressing the button
 
02:00:24.129 --> 02:00:24.139 align:start position:0%
up front
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon my name's
 
02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Fisher I am a native of Dover
 
02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as a kid I spent many
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
many hours
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
and actually as an adult I spend many
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
many hours on the piscataqua river I'm
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to pass around a little picture
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
please ignore the stuff on the back I
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
save paper so I want to pass around two
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
things one is a picture of the dock that
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
used to be there and also um a article
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
from profiles and courage and many of
 
02:00:59.089 --> 02:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
you profile excuse me magazine many of
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
you may remember if you've been in New
 
02:01:02.330 --> 02:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a long time that was kind
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the magazine that came out on a
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
monthly basis I'm here to support this
 
02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
02:01:10.199 --> 02:01:10.850 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
um

02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
as I said I have spent a lot of time on
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
the piscataqua river over the years
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
launching in Dover launching over in
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
Durham and attempting to launch at
 
02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
Hilton park with my little 14-foot
 
02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:24.050 align:start position:0%
Hilton park with my little 14-foot
Merrimack

02:01:24.050 --> 02:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and in all honesty if you back your
 
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
trailer down that ramp
 
02:01:34.729 --> 02:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
um boat launch you may lose a wheel in
 
02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
the process but we persevere because we
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
like to sail and it's one place that we
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
can put
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
um our boats in so that clearly needs to
 
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
be taken care of in the short term if
 
02:01:49.129 --> 02:01:49.139 align:start position:0%
not in the long term I'm also passing
 
02:01:51.790 --> 02:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
around a little photograph of the dock
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
that existed for many many many years
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
and was used by both people with the
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
Miramax and if you look at the profiles
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
you'll see that they had these little
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
tiny one-person speed boats but there's
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
also larger larger boats that would like
 
02:02:10.089 --> 02:02:10.099 align:start position:0%
to be able to utilize that
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
so I received a phone call from an
 
02:02:16.129 --> 02:02:16.139 align:start position:0%
organization called Dover 400. we like
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth are celebrating 400 years of
 
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
existence and so they wanted to do
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
something down at Hill Park and because
 
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's where it all began and
 
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
um I went down and looked around and we
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
tour or a parade a boat parade the
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
problem is the ramp is in such condition
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be dangerous to try and do
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
that so we'll have to launch those boats
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
someplace else and we're talking about
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
moving it up to the Dover Waterfront
 
02:02:47.699 --> 02:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
moving it up to the Dover Waterfront
um

02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
considering the condition which is
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
deteriorated from last year I reached
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
out to Senator Waters and I want to
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank him for his efforts and his
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
leadership with regards to this to see
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
if there was something we could do short
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
term as well as as long term I also
 
02:03:04.990 --> 02:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to Senator Shaheen's office
 
02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
to see because we know that there was
 
02:03:10.209 --> 02:03:10.219 align:start position:0%
Federal money for infrastructure
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
and so the solution is for these three
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
entities to get together to try and
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
figure out a long-term solution so that
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
there is adequate Public Access for all
 
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
citizens to be able to get onto the
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
piscata coach kachiko Bellamy and out to
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Al's of Shoals a few years ago I
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
became a UNH Marine docent and I lead
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
tours out to appledore and also up and
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
down the piscata cost so I'm pretty
 
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
familiar with that whole area and this
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
is a jewel that just isn't being
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
utilized and I want to put my efforts
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
into trying to to make that happen the
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
best that that I possibly can so I
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support of this study I
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
think there's some solutions that can
 
02:03:58.129 --> 02:03:58.139 align:start position:0%
come forward I think the players that
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters has put together are the
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
right players and and certainly there's
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
the public support within the boating
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
community both sailboats as well as
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
motorboats to to use this space thank
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
you I think we can work through the
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth I'm I must say anyone that
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
would launch anything only 14 foot long
 
02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
off of that into that high current area
 
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
is a person much braver than myself well
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
you do it at the slack tide
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
and then you head upriver thank you
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you

02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
today in support of Senate bill 228. our
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
organization is focused on developing
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
the next generation of River and Bay
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
stewards and we do that by bringing
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
nearly 2500 students in third fourth
 
02:05:22.729 --> 02:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
fifth sixth and seventh grade
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
out on the piscataqua river and uh
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
introducing them to A New Perspective
 
02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
most of those kids have never been out
 
02:05:32.689 --> 02:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
on the water before so when they get out
 
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
there they're sort of their jaws hang
 
02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
open because they've never seen
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth or places like that from the
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
water itself
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we use a replica gondolo uh the
 
02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
piscataqua which was built in 2011.
 
02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
and we also
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
offer public sales private Charters and
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
since 2016 we've offered a summer day
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
camp which started out with 12 campers
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
in 2016 and has expanded to 470 in this
 
02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
past summer and we're looking to be
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
nearly that number for this coming year
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
all told we routinely sail with nearly
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
10 000 passengers each year and hope to
 
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
reinforce the ideas of conservation
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
preservation and sustainability when it
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
comes to the estuarian environment
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
contained within the piscatica Watershed
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
we conduct approximately 20 percent of
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
our sales up in the Great Bay Little Bay
 
02:06:29.689 --> 02:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
Area each year
 
02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
and we travel up from the the dock in
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
Prescott Park and we dock typically at
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
the UNH estuarian lab the Jackson lab in
 
02:06:39.719 --> 02:06:40.729 align:start position:0%
the UNH estuarian lab the Jackson lab in
Durham

02:06:40.729 --> 02:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
the renovation of the boat ramp and the
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
construction of a new boat dock at
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
Hilton Park would provide this these are
 
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
potential benefits I'm not talking that
 
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to happen but potential
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
benefits would provide an opportunity
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
for us to expand our education programs
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
in that area and also could potentially
 
02:07:03.530 --> 02:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
reduce the costs to schools in Durham
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
Dover Lee Madbury Nottingham where I
 
02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:10.699 align:start position:0%
live Barrington Epping places like that
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that would afford us another place to
 
02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
be able to to dock the gundalo and um
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
board students and take them out on the
 
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
board students and take them out on the
river

02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
river
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
the renovated boat ramp and floating
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
dock would also provide an additional
 
02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
site to conduct some of our summer camp
 
02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
site to conduct some of our summer camp
programs

02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
which would allow us to reach even more
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
young people and help to further our
 
02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.589 align:start position:0%
young people and help to further our
mission

02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
mission
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
we also see access to Hilton Park from
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
the floating dock and boat ramp as a
 
02:07:41.169 --> 02:07:41.179 align:start position:0%
potential site for holding our annual
 
02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
piscataqua Riverfest
 
02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
which brings together our non-profit
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
Partners Maritime theme vendors and
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
Crafters musicians local food trucks and
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
includes a wooden boat show showcasing
 
02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
the time-honored craft of wooden boat
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
building in the Seacoast area
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
all with the goal of celebrating the
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
rivers bays and tributaries in the
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
Watershed and bringing awareness of the
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
conservation and preservation efforts
 
02:08:06.530 --> 02:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
that are related to the waterways going
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
on throughout the Seacoast
 
02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.219 align:start position:0%
lastly and as Senator Waters pointed out
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
we do about 20 of our sales up in that
 
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
area and having a dock at Hilton Park
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
would also provide another place for us
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
to go in the event that we had in
 
02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
medical emergency on board
 
02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:26.540 align:start position:0%
uh with an adult or even a child
 
02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
there are commercial docs in that area
 
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
that we could potentially get to but the
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
issue of getting the First Responders
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
out to the dock to take care of the
 
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
emergency would be the issue there so
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
having a Hilton Park would allow the
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
First Responders to get there and be
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
able to treat any emergencies in a more
 
02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:45.659 align:start position:0%
timely manner I want to thank you for
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to speak to
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
any questions for the gentleman
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:08:58.970 --> 02:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious I've been at that ramp
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
at low tide and you can't even hardly
 
02:09:08.689 --> 02:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
get a boat in and out could you tell me
 
02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.099 align:start position:0%
approximately how what you'd have to do
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
the size of the gondola the length and
 
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
how much water you need to be in to even
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
come into a dock how how far out do you
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
have to include dredging or how exactly
 
02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:23.099 align:start position:0%
would you do that if it was low tide
 
02:09:25.970 --> 02:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
um so we are the draft on our ship is
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
two and a half feet
 
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
which means that we can go into water
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's about three feet deep at low tide
 
02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
there we probably would not try to tie
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
up to a dock because of the shallow
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
water we would have to time our comings
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
and goings there based on the tide not
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
like in Prescott Park we have plenty of
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
water underneath the dock so there's not
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
a problem there but other places that we
 
02:09:49.729 --> 02:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
go we have to be very cautious and um
 
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
pruned with our timing to be able to
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
land thank you yep
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:10:04.089 --> 02:10:04.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
we um I see no further cards for any
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony here
 
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.129 align:start position:0%
testimony here
um so

02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
I am going to pull to a close uh Senate
 
02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:19.089 align:start position:0%
I am going to pull to a close uh Senate
Bill

02:10:19.089 --> 02:10:19.099 align:start position:0%

228 FN as amended by the Senate
 
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
and entertain we have the um
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
we have this noticed as possible
 
02:10:34.129 --> 02:10:34.139 align:start position:0%
executive session to follow and I would
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion on Senate Bill 228 FN
 
02:10:40.609 --> 02:10:40.619 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
02:10:40.619 --> 02:10:42.410 align:start position:0%
as amended
oh

02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I rep I recognize representative Jack
 
02:10:47.089 --> 02:10:47.099 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I move out to

02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
motion by Jack ought to pass secondary
 
02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
motion's been made in second in
 
02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:02.450 align:start position:0%
motion's been made in second in
discussion

02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
yes represent noon thank you
 
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of this one I can't
 
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
support the bill I was written I think
 
02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:11.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:14.649 --> 02:11:14.659 align:start position:0%
who the authority goes through
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
and what they're going to come up with
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
it just seems to be too broad and vague
 
02:11:27.490 --> 02:11:27.500 align:start position:0%
for me
 
02:11:35.209 --> 02:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
paying for the study
 
02:11:39.010 --> 02:11:39.020 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
the question is who's paying for the
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
study they the persons that are part of
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
that study will fund this will fund this
 
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
this project if there are funds the
 
02:11:51.970 --> 02:11:51.980 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
and Dot is not is not paying for it is
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
was the testimony that we heard from the
 
02:11:57.480 --> 02:11:59.390 align:start position:0%
was the testimony that we heard from the
Department

02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
I think I think the vehicle they're
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
looking to do is to convene a group of
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
people and let them have a conversation
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
on how this would evolve and I I think
 
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
the senator has kept it Loose that we
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
know the speaker does not want to see
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
commissions where at all possible and
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I think I think they're trying to
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
pull this together and see if those
 
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
parties can come to an agreement and see
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
if there is federal funding available
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
out there and if so they they could
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
possibly move forward so it's loot it's
 
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
loose by Design I will tell you that
 
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
having any money in this so just we we
 
02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
02:12:48.890 --> 02:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to agree with my seat mate
 
02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:52.189 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to agree with my seat mate
this

02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon to have bills come
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
from the other chamber that are similar
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
that are exceedingly loose
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
and throw responsibility on other
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
parties not knowing what they're going
 
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.410 --> 02:13:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
who's running the study who's in charge
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
of it who's going to be part of it it's
 
02:13:21.129 --> 02:13:21.139 align:start position:0%
so nebulous so loose and I understand
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
there may be a few people willing to
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
work together but um
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a whole lot of
 
02:13:29.089 --> 02:13:29.099 align:start position:0%
people are going to chime in for free
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
and give you the cost of construction of
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
a boat ramp of a dock uh particularly
 
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
where it's located where it's going to
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
be a pretty pricey operation to do
 
02:13:38.219 --> 02:13:38.810 align:start position:0%
be a pretty pricey operation to do
um

02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
I just think it's far too nebulous to
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
let loose on its own even to the point
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
where they and it still concerns me if
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
you look at the cover page it says as
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate the title is not
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
amended it directs the department of
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
fish and game department of
 
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
transportation to construct a boat ramp
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
at Hilton Park in Dover
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
the title instructs that as amended by
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
ripsham Jack uh thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:14:11.930 --> 02:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
would just point out the title of the
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
bill is an act relative to the hilden
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
park boat ramp says nothing about
 
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
construction uh the language you're
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
referring to is in the analysis that was
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
prepared I guess by oh well I'm not sure
 
02:14:29.089 --> 02:14:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
enal study repairs
 
02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:34.729 align:start position:0%
enal study repairs
okay

02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.089 --> 02:14:38.099 align:start position:0%
I do not believe it is
 
02:14:38.099 --> 02:14:39.770 align:start position:0%
I do not believe it is
I

02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
will we'll take we'll take comments
 
02:14:42.649 --> 02:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
first and then there might be an
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
alternative motion here yes yeah I would
 
02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:55.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
a study committee on this committee
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
to have one or two meetings if we've got
 
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
the time and say hey can we pull
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
something together on this that's
 
02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
you know tighten it up enough to wire
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
liking I guess would be and if we can't
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
we can't but if we can't I think the
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill warrants the effort to try to do
 
02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.450 align:start position:0%
bill warrants the effort to try to do
something

02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh is the members suggesting possibly
 
02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:30.350 align:start position:0%
uh is the members suggesting possibly
retaining

02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay good time okay
 
02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes just in the collective wisdom of the
 
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
senior members of this committee that
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
the notes that I took Fish and Game
 
02:15:44.569 --> 02:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
D.O.T and peas development to work
 
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
together and study what could be done
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
and then I made a note study and get a
 
02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
report together in the past have any of
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
you all senior people seen anything like
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
this where you've gotten some groups
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
that agree to get together
 
02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:03.770 align:start position:0%
that agree to get together
um

02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
and just at least brainstorm what could
 
02:16:08.450 --> 02:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and then they could come back with a
 
02:16:12.169 --> 02:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
report on
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
either we need an estimate or you need
 
02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
an estimate or maybe one of their in
 
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
expertise of them that they would have
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
an idea of what a new boat ramp could
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
cost I thank you for the question I have
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
not in my time seen a similar piece of
 
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
legislation that was not committing to
 
02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
the makeup and or a study or what the
 
02:16:40.969 --> 02:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.979 --> 02:16:45.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.089 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:16:50.089 --> 02:16:50.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
it seems that I thought this is just so
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
they could set up and do a study and
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
they've defined three departments that
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
should work together to create a study
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and that there was no commitment of
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
money or anything else or even the fact
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
of building anything yet it's just to
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
create a study so that I report can be
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
issued to
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
all the appropriate heads of States of
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
our government so that they can review
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
this then to see if it's worthy
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
financially worthy of moving forward or
 
02:17:30.889 --> 02:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
do we just after the study is done then
 
02:17:34.310 --> 02:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
put it on the shelf and say thank you we
 
02:17:37.810 --> 02:17:37.820 align:start position:0%
did the study and it's not financially
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
relevant to our budget so I'm confused
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
where all these other
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
issues are because it just says here in
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral too
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
that it's going to give a study and it's
 
02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
going to give it to these people and
 
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's to be studied by X number of people
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
represent Mills did you want to respond
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
oh yes I did I want to I want to thank
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
representative Boger because that's my
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
feeling on this also I also have never
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
seen anything set up quite this nebulous
 
02:18:13.849 --> 02:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason that I'm in favor
 
02:18:17.089 --> 02:18:17.099 align:start position:0%
of it is that first a it doesn't spend
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
any money it does name the three
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
entities that have to get together
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
the worst thing that can happen is if
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
the three entities decide dot says I'm
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
not kicking in a dime but I'm ready to
 
02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
give up the boat ramp Fish and Game says
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
I want nothing to do with this and peace
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
goes well I don't want to fight over who
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
it is this has got a time sensitive data
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
on it this says the 24 the end of this
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that's it it dies it goes
 
02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere if they if they're all
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
interested and want to cooperate with
 
02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
each other then they come up and said
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
here's the deal this is what we can do
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
this is what it's going to cost these
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
are the mechanics here's the new bill we
 
02:19:01.969 --> 02:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
need this done rapidly so that we can
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
get federal funds so this bill by itself
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
it either it just lives or dies they
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
either get us information or they don't
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.209 --> 02:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:26.209 --> 02:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
yeah let's do how many advice Jack is
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
recognized on the advice of council I I
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw my emotions
 
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
well the second second be withdrawn
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
I will withdraw my motion okay
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
there there seems to be uh diverse
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
opinion on
 
02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
on the um the legislation before us
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to have more consensus I
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
like the idea of a more study on it or
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
an amendment that might possibly come to
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
us that would clear this up so I will
 
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I will do as we did before we have no
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
motion before us for
 
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
um for approval of this I think I'd like
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
to recess out of
 
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
228 FN is amended and we will come back
 
02:20:21.889 --> 02:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
at a date to be posted in the uh in the
 
02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
calendar to further deliberate this and
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
we'll notice that as an executive
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
session at that time Mr chairman just a
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
question I believe neither one of these
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
are early bills the bill we heard
 
02:20:35.810 --> 02:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
earlier and I believe the deadline is
 
02:20:37.969 --> 02:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
May 11th according to what the uh what
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
was that the chairs means I believe the
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
deadline is more at the end of May right
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
so we've got till the end of May as a
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
committee to to work on this if we have
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion so just to clarify
 
02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
I'm willing that was a great question
 
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
even though it's an FN bill it's we
 
02:21:04.929 --> 02:21:04.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
I will contact the speaker's office to
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
get a definitive answer on that uh we
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
are coming we are coming tentatively for
 
02:21:17.690 --> 02:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
a session on April what was that the
 
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
last is the end of April April I think
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
27th the last I think Thursday in April
 
02:21:24.410 --> 02:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
which I believe is the 27th so there
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
might be an opportunity for us to to tag
 
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
on to that day or uh but we'll look at
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
the schedule and see where it is we'll
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the sponsors and see if we can
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
get some clarification on both of these
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
bills because Mr chairman is just for
 
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
everybody we have had committee meetings
 
02:21:43.490 --> 02:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
after sessions the sessions have been
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
short or depending on maybe if we have a
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
a 1pm session we could meet in the
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
morning or if we have a session gets
 
02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
done noon 1 pm we could meet in the
 
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
afternoon if we have to and we have had
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
lunch meetings uh typically The Freshman
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislators pay for the pizza for the
 
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
day but that we we have several
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities there so uh with that I'll
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
call this uh hearing
 
02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:11.809 align:start position:0%
call this uh hearing
recess

02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think yeah the more I listen to it I
 
02:22:23.889 --> 02:22:23.899 align:start position:0%
think won't be United is committee
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
I think the questions are all valid yeah
 
02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's asking I really yeah I want
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
to see it happen right yeah right I mean
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think yeah the 228 we can we can amend
 
02:22:40.330 --> 02:22:40.340 align:start position:0%
