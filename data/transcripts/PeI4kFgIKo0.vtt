31
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
does uh really two things right now
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
when someone either registers
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
and says that they uh last voted
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh especially out of state but uh even
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
in state
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh that information is put into election
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
net and
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
this shifts the responsibility of
 
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.749 align:start position:0%
this shifts the responsibility of
notifying

00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
notifying
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
the out-of-state people
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
from the town clerk and the supervisors
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the checklist
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state they can
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
gather these things up
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the contacts that they have through
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's network
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
and provide that information and also
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
get that information from
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
the other states that we're doing this
 
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:24.710 align:start position:0%
the other states that we're doing this
with

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's the surrounding states and it
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
should mean
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
a much more efficient and
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
easier process on the towns to complete
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
that and to keep their
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
their checklist updated with the
 
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
information that's provided
 
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.469 align:start position:0%
information that's provided
[Music]

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
the other portion of this has to do with
 
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.509 align:start position:0%
the other portion of this has to do with
the

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
absentee affidavit
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
both of these items were talked about in
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
the interviews that were done with the
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state after the last
 
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.269 align:start position:0%
secretary of state after the last
election

00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
and they noted that there was people if
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
they had a problem with the affidavit
 
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.269 align:start position:0%
they had a problem with the affidavit
sometimes

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
they didn't sign either one and when
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
asked about it they were confused about
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
which one to sign
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's really no reason in state law
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
that we need to have
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
two separate affidavits this combines
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
the reason at the top of the form
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
lets you sign one place
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
and that combined with some other
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that you'll get
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
about opening the outer envelope sooner
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
should ensure that even if someone does
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
make a mistake
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh that there will be ample time for
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
them to correct it
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh but like i say with this piece of
 
00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.310 align:start position:0%
uh but like i say with this piece of
legislation

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
um the first section that i talked about
 
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.670 align:start position:0%
um the first section that i talked about
should

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
make it more accurate the information
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
going back and forth between
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
us vermont maine etc
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and also in here reducing the confusion
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
of the voter of which affidavit they
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
should be signing so
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions you
 
00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.190 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions you
have

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%

mike my question deals with the first
 
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.710 align:start position:0%
mike my question deals with the first
section

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
654 654-13 action by supervisors
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
lines eight through ten um it states
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
that if a person
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
enters uh the place last register
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
registered to vote on the voter
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
registration form it shall be entered
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
into the statewide
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
voter registration database there's
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
already a statute that
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
i guess maybe it doesn't demand that
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
they do it but there's already a statute
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
the the form and the database shall
 
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%
the the form and the database shall
include

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
the current information on the voter
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
registration forms
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
pertaining to last place registered to
 
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.069 align:start position:0%
pertaining to last place registered to
vote

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
why is there a need to have this in two
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
different statutes
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
there probably isn't this wording
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
was provided to me by the secretary of
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that it conflicts in
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
any way
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
and having it in both parts of the
 
00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:26.310 align:start position:0%
and having it in both parts of the
statute

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
having it here i think promotes
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
readability of the statute
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh without having to go to another
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
statute to read
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
what it says there okay if your
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee decides that you want to do
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
something different
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll review it when it gets
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator no further
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
crosscheck
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
program or an interstate program
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
to monitor movements in and out of the
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
state change of addresses
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
which i think a good idea
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
but what i would direct the committee's
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
is the electronic registration
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
information center
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
also known as eric um which was founded
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh in 2012 as part of the pew
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
charitable trust but has now been taken
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
over by the member states
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
um of which there are many um a majority
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
of states are now
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
members of eric um and these are uh
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
republican controlled state
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
democratic controlled states um and eric
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
was created to fix
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
a major challenge facing election
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
officials um and that's how to ensure
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
easy access to voter registration while
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining accurate voter lists
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
in this difficult for election officials
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
to do particularly now in days as
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know americans move around so much
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
um inexpensive research confirms that
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's mobility can make it hard for
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
voters to keep up to date
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
for example in the past 10 years i've
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
lived in newmarket i've lived in ward 2
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
manchester ward 3 manchester so
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know me alone i i i appear
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
on many different motor lists so um
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
since voter lists and records can be out
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
of date
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
election officials can send information
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
to voters who do not exist
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
voters who cannot receive information
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
from where they've moved
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
or how to vote when voters don't have
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
that correct information they end up
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
having problems at the polls
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
leading to longer lines frustration
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
all things that can be avoided uh so
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
eric is a sophisticated data center
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
governed again
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
by the state to choose to participate um
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
which helps keep these voters up to date
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
while also increasing access to voter
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
registration for eligible citizens
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
again 31 states plus the district of
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
columbia are members
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and notably both florida and
 
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.230 align:start position:0%
and notably both florida and
massachusetts

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
are member states of eric and why i draw
 
00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:13.829 align:start position:0%
are member states of eric and why i draw
attention

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
to those two states in particular is
 
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
to those two states in particular is
that

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
during our participation in cross
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
check the some run out of kansas which
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
is now
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
um defunct and uh no longer operating
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
a majority of those duplicates that were
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
flagged for the secretary of state
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
came from florida and massachusetts
 
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.749 align:start position:0%
came from florida and massachusetts
what's

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
what makes a lot of sense if you lived
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for any period of time
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
so both of those states are members of
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
this existing program
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
as well as a majority of northeastern
 
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.710 align:start position:0%
as well as a majority of northeastern
states

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
and so what does eric do and what are
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
the benefits for new hampshire
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
one it's going to identify millions of
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
voters who have moved within
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
state and out of state you know they've
 
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.069 align:start position:0%
state and out of state you know they've
identified

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
2.5 million voters who moved out of
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
state and therefore no longer eligible
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
to vote in that state
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
over 240 000 voter records for
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who have passed away
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
since they last voted over 320
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
000 duplicate registration records um
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
in all total since 2018 eric is
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for correcting
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
over 10 million voter records were no
 
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.069 align:start position:0%
over 10 million voter records were no
longer

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
accurate so this really does a good
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
job of making sure
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
we are catching double registrations
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're tracking who's moving in state
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
out of state and there's all of this
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
will be done for new hampshire
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
as a member of eric um for a very
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
nominal cost
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
of you know the the first year um of
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
eric membership which includes an entry
 
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:53.590 align:start position:0%
eric membership which includes an entry
fee

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
due would be around 50 to 60 thousand
 
00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.629 align:start position:0%
due would be around 50 to 60 thousand
dollars

00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
mr myers this is a representative
 
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.230 align:start position:0%
mr myers this is a representative
griffin

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
griffin
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
um are you testifying about the state
 
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
um are you testifying about the state
joining

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
joining
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
eric or are you testifying about the
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill because i don't see a fiscal note
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
and i didn't take this bill to mean we
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
were joining eric and
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
senator gray is still online perhaps you
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
can respond after you finish
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my the reason i bring up
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
eric is i believe i i would encourage
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider an amendment
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
for section
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
three senses instructing the secretary
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
state to build a program
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
that already exists in the form of eric
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me to be a colossal waste
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer dollars
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the secret secretary of state to
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
build an independent system
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
from what already exists that we could
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
become a member of and join a majority
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
of states
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
that would accomplish the goals fourth
 
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
that would accomplish the goals fourth
in

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
that amendment in section three of the
 
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:04.230 align:start position:0%
that amendment in section three of the
bill

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
represent for
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
mr meyer from committee members yes
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
ma'am can i have a question
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry uh mr meyers did
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
you say that massachusetts was a member
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
of eric
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh they are in the process of becoming
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
okay so they're not currently a member
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
but they have passed legislation to join
 
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:30.070 align:start position:0%
but they have passed legislation to join
and

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
and also the technically hampshire does
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
not need legislation to enter into eric
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state could could do that
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
on his own
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
um you know be good forever to be on
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
senator greg lord as a member
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
mr meyer you just told us massachusetts
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
was a member and apparently they're not
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
so perhaps you can follow up in writing
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
as to who exactly is a member of eric
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gray did you want to
 
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gray did you want to
respond

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
um certainly over the past uh six seven
 
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.630 align:start position:0%
um certainly over the past uh six seven
years

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
we have had the discussion about
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
cross-check and eric
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
several times it was brought up in the
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
last sessions
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
you know eric is out there eric requires
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
you to do several things beyond
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
this cross-checking of information it
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
prescribes how you were going to solicit
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
new voters uh parts of the things that
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
are in eric are also considered
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the u.s house bill h.r
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
one um and we might be having a
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
different conversation had
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
had that bill been passed by both the
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
house and the senate and signed by the
 
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
house and the senate and signed by the
president

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
but it is not this is not a new system
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
the system out there uh often referred
 
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.150 align:start position:0%
the system out there uh often referred
to

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
as the election net is existing it
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
already has the capability to produce
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
the files
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
that would be transmitted to the other
 
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.310 align:start position:0%
that would be transmitted to the other
states

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a no-cost option that's why
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have a fiscal note
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
and if the good representative wants to
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.950 align:start position:0%
and if the good representative wants to
introduce

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that mandates that the state go
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
into eric
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that next november when we open
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
up the
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
ability for him to file that legislation
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
he may do so
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments from
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
um let me go to is there anybody else
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
attending this meeting
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
from the public who would like to
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:14.549 align:start position:0%
 
us

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
i believe i have pam if you're on it i
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
believe i
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
promoted miss spencer she hasn't
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
she's with us i'm so sorry i
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
i've didn't unmute myself i apologize
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
for that okay
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning um hello
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair for
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh taking my testimony this morning um
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
i did want to speak to to section three
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
as well uh because i think it is
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
so essential this component that we have
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
accurate voting rolls
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
it is the foundation of ensuring safe
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
and secure elections
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's what inspires confidence that those
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
who are voting are in fact current
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
eligible voters reduces the risk of
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
identity fraud
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
saves time for the state and local
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
workers who administer
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
our elections and and it reduces costs
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
so i think we all agree
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
here that um and i know that you as
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
members of the election
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
um law committee know this better than
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
than most
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
folks uh the national conference of
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
state legislators has said that the goal
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
of maintaining an accurate voter list is
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
that eligible voters are able to cast a
 
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
that eligible voters are able to cast a
ballot

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
to keep track of who has voted to
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
prevent anyone from voting twice
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
and by reducing inaccuracies speed up
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
the voter check-in process at polling
 
00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
the voter check-in process at polling
places

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
voter registration lists they also say
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
are the foundation of everything else in
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
election administration
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
so just underscoring that really
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
important point
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
and section three of this bill
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
of accurate voting lists the question is
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
how do we get there
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
and um as mr meyer testified there are
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
tools out there
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
and eric is is one such
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
tool um that i think it is
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful for this committee
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
to take a look at
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
in the context of of this bill
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
i've over the course of the last
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
election cycle i sat
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
in on many many supervisors of the
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
in on many many supervisors of the
checklists

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
checklists
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
um meetings and election net while being
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
a helpful tool
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
is by far um
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
from being the tool that is needed by
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
these election workers
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
um in fact one day i went to supervisors
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
of the checklist
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
meeting that had to be postponed because
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh election net was down and when
 
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh election net was down and when
everybody

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
signs in all at once when when these
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
meetings are held on the same day
 
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
meetings are held on the same day
leading

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
leading
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
up to elections uh the system gets
 
00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.669 align:start position:0%
up to elections uh the system gets
overloaded

00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
overloaded
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
um the beauty of a system like eric
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
is that it allows states to be uploading
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
i mean towns i'm sorry
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
to be um getting the data on a regular
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
rolling basis
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh so that they can update um as they go
 
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
uh so that they can update um as they go
along

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
also many times i was in on discussions
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
where supervisors were saying they were
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
not able to access
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
particular information about voters
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
and were trying to have to resort to
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
arcane methods of mix and match and
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
guessing about whether they were talking
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
about the same voter in fact i've
 
00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.390 align:start position:0%
about the same voter in fact i've
witnessed

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
witnessed
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
where they were unable to they actually
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
because of the difficulty in matching
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
this information
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
um made some mistakes about recommending
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
who should be removed
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
from the polls one thing i would like to
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
say is that a tool like eric
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
is really it is just that
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's a tool it does not require
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
the state to do anything in other words
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
it provides data that the state
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
can use i do agree with senator gray
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
that in the instance of eric it does
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
have some um the members do agree to
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
take certain steps in reaching out to
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
unregistered voters which i think is
 
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
unregistered voters which i think is
actually

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
a net benefit of a program like eric
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the data itself that is
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
stand-alone reporting that comes back to
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
the states
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
that then can be used as a tool so i've
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
seen the frustration that supervisors of
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
the checklist have
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that we need to
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
address there is
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
a tool out there and available and to be
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
suggesting that as the secretary of
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
state i know
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
has done in several meetings uh and
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
hearings that i've been a part of that
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
we should build our own tool
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh really um is going to present a cost
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
to the state that that is pretty hefty
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
um if not insurmountable
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and requires a degree of
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
investment of time and resources that um
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
seems unwise when we have such a good
 
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:23.510 align:start position:0%
seems unwise when we have such a good
tool

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
tool
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
as eric available so i too would
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
recommend and hope
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
that you would be looking at
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
adopting or having
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
an amendment brought before this
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee so that
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
you could really take a good look i
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
think we saw
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
that elections you know we we all
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's a bipartisan issue we all agree
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to ensure the safe
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
and secure elections and the confidence
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
that people have in our elections so
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%

perkins quoca i represent senate
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
district 21 which is
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and surrounding towns on the
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
seacoast i'm prime sponsor of sb46
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the use of electronic
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
poll books by cities and towns
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
a pilot program on the use of electronic
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
pool books began around 2015.
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
the towns that have been involved have
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
had a very good experience
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
and are anxious to make the program
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
permanent specifically i've spoken to
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
the town clerk of milford who has
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
participated in the pilot program she's
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
very supportive of this spell
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any issues that have
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
arisen with the electronic pullback
 
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
arisen with the electronic pullback
system

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
and the pilot the language involved in
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
sb-46 would create an entirely opt-in
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
system for our municipalities and no
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
municipality would be forced to adopt
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
electronic poll books if they did not
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
wish to
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
an electronic poll book is a small
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
administrative change that will be used
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
on election day
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
instead of having paper checklists towns
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
that choose to use poll books will have
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
electronically on a computer or ipad
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
such devices can or cannot be hooked up
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
to wi-fi
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
although i'll address that further below
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
poll books will speed up lines at
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
which will decr decrease waiting times
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
for voters and it makes elections
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
officials jobs easier
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
not only with less people flowing
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
through the point not only with people
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
flowing through the polling place
 
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.389 align:start position:0%
flowing through the polling place
quicker

00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
but poll books tabulate all of the
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
information that election officials have
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
to collect at the end of the election
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
saving municipalities time and money
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
the process on election day would remain
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
largely the same
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
the voters would be asked to provide the
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
same documentation they are now
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
if they do not have documentation they
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
will be able to sign an affidavit
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
the hope is that electronic pullbooks
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
simply provide a quicker check-in and
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
shutdown for the clerks
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
they also can enable additional ways to
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
back up the checkup information
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
as some towns have used the electronic
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
system alongside a paper system in order
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
to create duplicates
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
after extensive conversation with the
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office in the
 
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.350 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office in the
senate

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
process under the current language of
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
the bill the poll books will be
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
will need to be approved by the
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
as the and they are not comfortable at
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
this time approving the systems for
 
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.190 align:start position:0%
this time approving the systems for
voter

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
voter
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
registration which is another capability
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the poll books
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
that would require connecting the
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
machines to wi-fi or the internet
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
which is a process the sos needs more
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
time to vet
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
so at this time the ask is simply to
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
allow the use of electronic pull books
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
once approved by the secretary of state
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
for voter checking
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
that said the hope is that we have
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
electronic pullbacks available as an
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
option for voter check-in for the
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
municipal elections for the fall
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
so that the clerks wish they are able to
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
use the system in a live election prior
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
to the federal and state elections next
 
00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
to the federal and state elections next
year

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chairwoman for
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%

answer
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
any questions although there are some
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
here who may be better equipped to
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
answer those questions
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh is there are there
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
any members of the question
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
of representative terozian thank you
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you senator for
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question i think i heard you
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
um if this is adopted the idea is to
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
at some point have the ability in
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
essence have
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
um uh polling places be connected to the
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh internet did i hear that correctly
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
and could you elaborate on the reason
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
sure and and just to restate that's not
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the proposal
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
this year though this legislation would
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
enable the secretary of state to approve
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
poll books
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
in conversation with them and i don't
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
know if deputy scanlan is available
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
today but
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
um you know that that process would take
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
some time so
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
um that's not what we're proposing to be
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
available this year but
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
yes eventually you know um like any
 
00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:50.950 align:start position:0%
yes eventually you know um like any
computer

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
or ipad uh these the software could be
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
hooked up to the internet and it could
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
be used for voter registration so in
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
other words the system would be
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
updated live for voters that choose to
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
take advantage of same-day registration
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
on election day
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative lane
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um senator
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh why is it the secretary of state is
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
approving the poll books rather than the
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
ballot commission because i think it's
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
the ballot commission that approves the
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
voting system if i'm not the voting
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
machines if i'm not mistaken
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
um that is a very good question
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative i unfortunately don't
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
think i'm the
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
right person to answer that but i do
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
hope um we can defer that question
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
potentially to one of the other speakers
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i'll make sure that it's answered
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative prudhomme
 
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
thank you representative prudhomme

thank you and thank you rep senator
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%

can you can everyone hear me okay yeah
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
we can hear you fine
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
excellent so my question is about
 
00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.149 align:start position:0%
excellent so my question is about
section

00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh four at the end and it talks about
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state preparing
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
a regularly updated set of instructions
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
and best use practices for the use of
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
electronic poll books
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
is that where the uh the
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet would be
 
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet would be
addressed

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
um it could be yep and i think there are
 
00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:31.990 align:start position:0%
um it could be yep and i think there are
some

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
other references in here i'm just i'm
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
just looking
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
for example in section two um
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the third line it references approval
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state so
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
yes both of those references and
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
actually the first sentence of section
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
three i'll i'll refer to how
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state would be able
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
these devices for successive uses over
 
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
these devices for successive uses over
time

00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
sorry i did not mean to raise my hand
 
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%

you need to get together with
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative murrah he raises his hand
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
when he doesn't want to talk and you
 
00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:32.630 align:start position:0%

yeah so you too right now but then it
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%

again thank you madam chairman and good
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
morning senator good morning
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
my hometown of londonderry actually has
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
been using the um
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
this this system on the last couple of
 
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.349 align:start position:0%
this this system on the last couple of
elections

00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
would they have had to get permission
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state to do that
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative that's a
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
good question under
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
the pilot program i believe that
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
um each town that wanted to use a new
 
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.150 align:start position:0%
um each town that wanted to use a new
vendor

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
needed to have that vendor approved and
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
i i believe that would have been a
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
process through the secretary of state
 
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
process through the secretary of state
but

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
i i would actually like to make sure
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
that that's true and ask that one of the
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
later speakers confirm that for you but
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
again i'll make sure that you get the
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up madam chairman
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
um senator uh so is the purpose of your
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
bill to basically achieve a uniformity
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
and a
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
careful regulation of this system should
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
it go statewide or be
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
more widely used uh
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's one of the purposes i
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
mean this is a tool that
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully will save our municipalities
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
time and money you know i know
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
from my years on city council in
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
portsmouth that election days are long
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
days they're 15 or 16 hour days for our
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
clerks and so
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
um yes i think uniformity is a good
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
thing i also think
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
options are a good thing and so not
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
every city or town may be ready to adopt
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
this yet and
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
until they are you know we may not get
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
to that uniformity but
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
the hope is that um now that we've had a
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
successful pilot program that we're just
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
simply giving our towns and cities more
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
tools to do their job thank you
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.470 align:start position:0%

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature did approve a trial
 
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.470 align:start position:0%
the legislature did approve a trial
program

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
for electronic poll books which involved
 
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.150 align:start position:0%
for electronic poll books which involved
a

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
first of all a town or towns or cities
 
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
first of all a town or towns or cities
interested

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
in testing them to
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
make that decision and then work with
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
an evaluation vendor which is designed
 
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.589 align:start position:0%
an evaluation vendor which is designed
to

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
look at the electronic poll books in use
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
take a look at their security
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
look for vulnerabilities and and the
 
00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:37.190 align:start position:0%
look for vulnerabilities and and the
overall

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
usability in the polling place there
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
i believe four towns
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire uh there have been four
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
there have been four cities and towns in
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that have
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
attempted to use them uh but
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
londonderry and milford have been using
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
them now for a couple of years
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
in a in a kind of a quasi-test format
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
the report from the evaluation vendor
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
at this point is incomplete
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
on both of those poll books
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
they have found some vulnerabilities i
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
know that you know that the vendors are
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
working on addressing those but i think
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
what we have learned
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
and this will all come out in a report
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's due in november
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislature is that uh
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
simply looking at an electronic poll
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
book in its entirety
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
and trying to approve it is
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
a a lot too a lot to deal with um
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the towns that have been how are you
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
um the towns that have been using them
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
have been using them
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh in parallel with the current uh
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
check-in system
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
but they have realized some real
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
benefits in terms of
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of the line at the
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
and then gathering and reporting all of
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
the data that they need at the end of
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
the night after the
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
polls close so this bill
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
would allow that process to move forward
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a more formal
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
way and save the issues related to
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
voter registration on the electoral book
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
for down the road because those
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
those issues a lot more complicated when
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know how do we integrate that
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
information directly with
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
voter database election net um
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
is it going to be hardwired connection
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
is it going to be
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
wi-fi um and if it is i mean those are
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
issues where
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
there are real security concerns and
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
there have been failures
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
in those systems in other states um
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
we are going to be meeting with uh the
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
clerks and the moderators
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
from the towns of milford and
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
londonderry next monday
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh to start the process of just
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
reviewing where they're at
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
how we can move this this
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
tool forward uh you know anticipating
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
the passage of this legislation
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can make the system more
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
broadly available to other
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in the state and then
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
in an incremental way
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
components of the system uh you know
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
moving in the direction of using it for
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
as well and we believe that process is
 
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.630 align:start position:0%
as well and we believe that process is
prudent

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh it makes sense for the for the state
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
and it allows the towns to be able to
 
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.750 align:start position:0%
and it allows the towns to be able to
use

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
the benefits of these systems by
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
reducing their lines at the polling
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
place and being being able to report
 
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.550 align:start position:0%
place and being being able to report
results

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
much faster at the end of the night when
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
i say results results in terms of
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
voter check-in information um which
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
does take them some time to do after the
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
polls close
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
so with that um oh representative lane
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
did ask a question about why doesn't the
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
beltlock commission
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
approve these devices the statute
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
gives the responsibility to the ballot
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
lock commission of approving
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting devices but
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
a poll book is not an electronic
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
counting device
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's something different i mean
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
certainly if the legislature wants to
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
include them
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the uh approval process um
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think that we would
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
oppose that belt law commission might
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
because it's more more work for them but
 
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.710 align:start position:0%
because it's more more work for them but
um

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why uh you know the
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
language and the bill did not include
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
the belt law commission uh from the
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
start so with that madam chair i would
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any other questions
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i always defer to deputy
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
scanlon as the master
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
of this zoom meeting right having run
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
the meetings last summer with hundreds
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
of people attending
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative terozzian did you
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you deputy scanlan for taking
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
my question so i just
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
want a couple of points of clarification
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
if i may so
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
i heard i believe i heard you say the
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
towns of londonderry and milton
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
have been using this kind of as a test
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
pilot program are there any other
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities using it
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that rochester at one point
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
tried them out and i believe that
 
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.069 align:start position:0%
tried them out and i believe that
manchester

00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh at one point may have tried them out
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
there are two different
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh vendors that provide the machines the
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
one that is used
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
in milford is known as electec
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
and the one that is used in londonderry
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
is known as
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
no inc and their product is called the
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up question madam chair
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so um would
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
would you like to see more testing then
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh prior to this becoming a
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
potentially permanent um edition
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
and would um is this legislation needed
 
00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:23.750 align:start position:0%
and would um is this legislation needed
to

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
to have other towns do testing of this
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and get more data
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
um i think we have reached the point now
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
where we can move the trial
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
forward into a program in terms of using
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
the devices
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
for check-in i think that that they have
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
the the trials that these two towns have
 
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.109 align:start position:0%
the the trials that these two towns have
done

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
in that regard show that they do work
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
and that they're a useful tool
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
and they they can make the process in
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
the towns more efficient
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to continue the work
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
where uh where we might consider
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh using the devices for voter
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
registration at the polling place
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the future i think that there's
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
still a lot that has to be
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
vetted uh in that regard and so
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
um the the bill is necessary because the
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
trial program ends
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of this year and this is
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
the next logical step to move
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh the process forward and uh as i
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the beginning
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
we are in agreement with that thank you
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you deputy
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
scanlan taking my question
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
my question is a bit of a two-parter
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
i would like to know why the the city
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
ward in manchester
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the city of rochester had previously
 
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.910 align:start position:0%
and the city of rochester had previously
participated

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
participated
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the trial but then did not
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
continue with that that's is that
 
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.870 align:start position:0%
continue with that that's is that
correct

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
do you know why and then my other
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
question is about vulnerabilities you
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
said some vulnerabilities were found
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
but what were those specifically talk
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
about that a bit thank you
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um the the
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
first question
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know the reason why uh
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
manchester and rochester
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
only uh use the devices once
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
um uh i don't know if senator gray is
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
able to comment on rochester
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
but but i don't know the answer to that
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
i don't specifically know what they are
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
i know that the the evaluation vendor
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh was not able to just give the devices
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
a clean bill of health
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
um they are required to give us a report
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh which we have not yet received
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
um and when they do that will be
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
that information will be made public and
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
will be part of the report
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh that we issue in november
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
however uh in terms of the voter
 
00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:06.790 align:start position:0%
however uh in terms of the voter
check-in

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
check-in
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh and the way that process has worked
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
with the safeguards that are currently
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that's a pretty safe system to
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
use and
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the concern there obviously is that
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
if the devices crashed
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
or were unable to
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
continue in use after the polls had
 
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.309 align:start position:0%
continue in use after the polls had
opened

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
opened
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to fall back onto a
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the paper system that we
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
have in place so that we can continue
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
the election without
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
lines forming and kind of losing track
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
of where we are and i think that
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
the trials that have been undertaken in
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
both milford
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
and londonderry have shown uh that we
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
and so our comfort level has gone way up
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
senator gray did you want to comment uh
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
madam chairman uh rochester has six
 
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
madam chairman uh rochester has six
wards

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
wards
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
we did the test in one of the wards
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
it was all equipment that was lent to us
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
by one of the vendors and as far as i
 
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.630 align:start position:0%
by one of the vendors and as far as i
know

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
because of the other tests that are
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing right now that
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity has not been provided to us
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
for the other awards or for an ongoing
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
basis even in ward 4.
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon and
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps senator gray you could answer
 
00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:36.870 align:start position:0%
perhaps senator gray you could answer
this

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
there was some talk about paper backups
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
in case there's a problem then the
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
election can continue
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
have there been any problems such as
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire i know we'll only
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
have the two communities
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
four that have used it have there been
 
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.870 align:start position:0%
four that have used it have there been
any

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
problems where they then had to use the
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
paper backups in new hampshire
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
how did that go um madam chair and
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of the trial towns having
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
any issues
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
with the poll books uh that they have
 
00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:10.870 align:start position:0%
with the poll books uh that they have
used

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
they both of the towns are using a paper
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
backup system
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
so that they're keeping track of the
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
voters that are going through
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh independently of the
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
at the check-in by the elect electronic
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
poll book
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
so if at any point uh during the
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
election there had been a failure
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh they would be up to date within 10 or
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
15 minutes
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and could put in
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
place a paper checklist to continue
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
the process moving forward with a very
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald you need to
 
00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:05.190 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald you need to
unmute

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um um
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
just a comment uh and i would refer to
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
our town clerk sherry farrell but by all
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
indications that i'm aware of
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
the system has worked very well for
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
londonderry so far
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
in every election when we've used it so
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
it has it has proven beneficial from
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
what i can see
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon this is barbara griffin i
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
um i am aware that there are other
 
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.230 align:start position:0%
um i am aware that there are other
jurisdiction

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
voting precincts not in new hampshire
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
that have used electronic poll books
 
00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
where the electronic poll books have
 
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.430 align:start position:0%
where the electronic poll books have
malfunctioned

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
malfunctioned
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
resulting in court proceedings to extend
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
the time the polls are open for the
 
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:53.990 align:start position:0%
the time the polls are open for the
amount

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
of time the poll books are were down
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i note that you say that we're doing
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
a paper
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
checklist parallel and there's a lag
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
time but if i go to
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill line 26
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
section 1 it provides that
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
or a paper checklist shall be marked in
 
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.910 align:start position:0%
or a paper checklist shall be marked in
parallel

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
parallel
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
so is a parallel checklist
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
required or not
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
and if it's not if the electronic pull
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
books go
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
down how do you then switch to
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
a paper checklist that has not been
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
getting completed
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
in parallel thank you uh thank you madam
 
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
in parallel thank you uh thank you madam
chair

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe the language in the bill
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh gives the flexibility
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh to require a
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know a paper checklist in parallel
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
with the electronic poll book which is
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much the
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
practice right now that is occurring in
 
00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.470 align:start position:0%
practice right now that is occurring in
londonderry

00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
londonderry
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
and milford there may be at some point
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
um you know enough
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
you know enough practice with these
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
devices enough experience
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
and enough confidence that you know we
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
can move away from that
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
process in the future but that would
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
only happen
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
if if we know that we can conduct an
 
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.589 align:start position:0%
if if we know that we can conduct an
election

00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know without the potential for
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
the failure because where it has
 
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.390 align:start position:0%
the failure because where it has
happened

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh it it has been catastrophic
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
and obviously that's something that we
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to have
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire and uh you know
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
and we would
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have proper procedures
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with that if it were to occur so
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
um hopefully that that answers your
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
question but
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe that that we would
 
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe that that we would
approve

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
a system where we would simply rely on
 
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:54.470 align:start position:0%
a system where we would simply rely on
the

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
electronic poll book until we have a lot
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
more information
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know relative to their ability to
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
to not malfunction well deputy if you
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
could take another look at the bill
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
because i think this bill proposes
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
exactly that that the paper checklist
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
is an alternative that's available and
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
o'brien has her hand up thank you
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon i'm not sure if this is a
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
question exactly but but i'll try to
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
phrase it as one
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
if the possibility for catastrophic
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
how is this an improvement over over
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
paper poll books i i understand
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
wanting to make the whole process go
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
faster but i think
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah how is it an improvement i'm just
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative o'brien so
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
the way the system uh has been working
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
now is
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
that that the polling places have been
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
following the statutory process
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the law which involves a paper
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
checklist which has to be marked off
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
as a voter goes through the towns
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
that are using the devices have decided
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
to use them in addition to the statutory
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
process that is currently
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
taking place and even by doing so
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
the benefit that they are realizing is
 
00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:33.510 align:start position:0%
the benefit that they are realizing is
that

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
the voters showing up at the polling
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
place does not have to get in a line
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
first of all by
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
the alphabet of the first letter in
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
their last name
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
they can go into any line that is the
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
shortest and
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
check in and then
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh and then there's a process there's a
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
slip that comes off that can be taken to
 
00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.109 align:start position:0%
slip that comes off that can be taken to
the

00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
supervisors that are marking the
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
checklist the name is marked off
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
checklist uh with a bit of a lag time
 
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:03.750 align:start position:0%
checklist uh with a bit of a lag time
but

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
but the paper checklist is being
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
maintained at that point
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that's a time savings right there um
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
and helps keep the lines in the polling
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
place moving
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
the real benefit however is at the end
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
of the night when the polls close
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the poll workers the supervisors of
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
the checklist are charged with
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
collecting the information off the paper
 
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.750 align:start position:0%
collecting the information off the paper
checklist

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of how many voters checked in
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of a primary
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
might be which which primary ballot they
 
00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:35.109 align:start position:0%
might be which which primary ballot they
took

00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
took
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
and things like that as that information
 
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:38.950 align:start position:0%
and things like that as that information
is

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
entered into the electronic poll book as
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
the voters check in
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
that information is immediately
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
available at the end of the night when
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
the polls close simply by
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
pressing a couple keys on the you know
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
on the laptop
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh that keeps that information and
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's a tremendous time savings
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the towns in that regard and
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
and so those two those two items alone
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh have been the real benefit that the
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
towns have seen
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh regarding these devices and i'm not
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
sure if if the clerks or the moderators
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
from milford or londonderry are
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
going to testify but you know they could
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
probably give you a better
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
you know a better explanation of
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that savings um uh
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know with their testimony thank you
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman i just
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment on a couple of those
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
um there's also savings after election
 
00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:37.990 align:start position:0%
um there's also savings after election
day

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
is that the town clerks go back into
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
election net
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
and mark you down as voted not voted
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
if it's a primary they also take and
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
mark up
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
what ballot that you've took um whether
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
you returned to your undeclared status
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
and that is another savings in addition
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
to the savings at uh
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
election day um the uh
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
there was another point i was going to
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
comment on uh but it escapes my mind
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
right now if i remember i'll i'll be
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
back with you if you have
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
any addition oh the
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
paper checklist okay that
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
the receipt that you get okay if the
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
voters are
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to go to any of the machines
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay then
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
the paper checklist isn't there for you
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
to mark it up
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
so there are schemes out there that says
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
that you would take that piece of
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
paper use that to get your ballot
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
and then that piece of paper would be
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
given to a clerk and the clerk would
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
mark up the checklist
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
from that slip of paper that was printed
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
out for when you voted
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's also talk about putting a qr
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
code on it
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
and having another computer there that
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
would scan that
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
and then automatically make up the
 
00:57:57.839 --> 00:57:58.710 align:start position:0%
and then automatically make up the
checklist

00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
but that would mean that you would have
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
to go back and
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
actually print the checklist in that 10
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
minute time frame that is talked about
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh in communities that have uh you know
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
more than 20 000 voters in the community
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
that becomes very difficult to do
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
so just those two comments i appreciate
 
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.069 align:start position:0%
so just those two comments i appreciate
you

00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
uh giving me the opportunity all right
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
we'll let you jump back in at any time
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh is there anybody else on the
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
committee representative growing
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary scanlan if
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned that there are
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that there have been
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
some significant security failures in
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
that have been catastrophic wouldn't it
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
be better at this point
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
to extend the trial period rather than
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
make this
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
a a permanent feature as it appears
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative growing for
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
that question um
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that we are ready to to move
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
the ball forward
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
on this understanding that
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
that there are there's a lot of
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
functionality to these devices
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me that that if we have to
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
approve the device
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
in in in one motion that it's going to
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
be a long time
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
coming um i think i think
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
the the great thing about this
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it allows
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
us the process to approve the
 
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.069 align:start position:0%
us the process to approve the
functionality

00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
in an incremental way where can
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
can realize the benefits of using them
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
where we are comfortable
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
that the technology is is going to be
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
safe and
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to impact
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
our election process if they go down
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think all of you know if you've been
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
following you know the
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's use of technology
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know in other areas in the state
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
is that we are very very cautious about
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know about going with newer
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
technology for these reasons is
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
that you know other states that have
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
that have tried things
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and and had failures
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
experienced real problems at the polling
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
place and and
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're pretty adverse to that so
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to approve something
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
technologically unless we are really
 
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
technologically unless we are really
sure

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh that has it has been properly vetted
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
that you know the experts
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know have taken a look at it and and
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
have that confidence that
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
the system is going to work and not and
 
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.109 align:start position:0%
the system is going to work and not and
not

01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
cause a failed election so um we are
 
01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.270 align:start position:0%
cause a failed election so um we are
comfortable

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh using the device where we know that
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
that it's going to function properly
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
um but we're also willing to look at the
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
other functionality uh again in an
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
incremental way so that
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're comfortable uh
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
seeing those benefits moving forward
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
once once we're confident that
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
they're fail safe
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so uh thank you
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon for joining us i'm going
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
to move on
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
to people who have signed up ahead of
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
time to speak
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
if they would raise their hand um i will
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
recognize them
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
um is there a joan doggie here
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%

you want to unmute you can speak to this
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
bill welcome
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much uh madam
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and uh
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone on the committee
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
and other others um
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes i am the town moderator in milford
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
i've been the town and school
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
district moderator now for uh 13 years
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
and have participated with our town
 
01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
and have participated with our town
clerk

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
joan dodgey in implementing the tests
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
that have been referred to
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
earlier today in milford we use the
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
electech brand of e poll book
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that process involves having the
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
voter checklist after the last
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist meeting
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
prior to an election that list is
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
downloaded onto the e-poll book
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
and then the e-poll books are brought to
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
the polling place
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
in electex implementation
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
in the way we use it in milford the
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
e-poll books are all hardwired one to
 
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
e-poll books are all hardwired one to
another

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
so there is no internet access
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
um on the e-poll books
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact the poll books and our
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
implementation are our computers
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
and they don't have wireless features on
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
those computers
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
when when a voter approaches the the
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
ballot clerk
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
and successfully checks in the voter is
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
handed a
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
a slip of paper much like a receipt that
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
you might
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
receive at a retail outlet and that
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
slip of paper has the information the
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
public information about the voter
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
their name their address their party
 
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
their name their address their party
affiliation

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
and before the voter leaves that station
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
we ask the voter to
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
double check to make sure that the
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
information on the slip of paper
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
which is the record that we have for
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
them in the checklist
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
is correct um so once that's
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
once the voter has reviewed the slip of
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
paper that we give them
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
they go to a common location where they
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
exchange the slip of paper
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a ballot if it's a primary
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's the obviously it'll be the party
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
ballot and if it's a local election it
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
would be the town and school district
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
ballot that slip of paper is retained by
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
the clerks who are handing out the
 
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.670 align:start position:0%
the clerks who are handing out the
ballots

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
and then periodically throughout the day
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh those slips of paper
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
are gathered up put into alphabetical
 
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.109 align:start position:0%
are gathered up put into alphabetical
order

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a set of clerks who are
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
marking on a paper checklist the voters
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
who have checked in
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
during the course of the day so as uh
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan pointed out
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
and as noted in the proposed legislation
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
we are we are making a copy of
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
the names of people who have uh checked
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
in successfully
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
in near real time um depending upon the
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
number of people in the in the
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
polling place at the moment it's it's in
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
that 10 or 15 minute
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
window that is referred to in in the
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
legislative proposed legislation
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
now when we think about catastrophic
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
failure remembering that
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
the implementation we have in milford is
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
not connected to the internet
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
that they're hardwired the machines are
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
all hardwired to each other and in
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the case of the match election just
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
passed we use
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
six books last fall in november we used
 
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.349 align:start position:0%
six books last fall in november we used
12.

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
when they're when they're all linked
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
together if it's a catastrophic failure
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's i it's it's uh would be depending
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
upon your definition of
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
catastrophe it could be one machine that
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
goes down
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
in which case all the others are still
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
up and running and still can process
 
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.470 align:start position:0%
up and running and still can process
voters

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
if several or all of the machines go
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
down that's when
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
we we would revert to the paper
 
01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
we we would revert to the paper
checklist

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
so anticipating the possibility
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
of a failure as moderator when i set up
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
the check
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
the polling places the night before i
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
make provision
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
for being able to change over to paper
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
checklist and remove the paper ballots
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
put up the signposts that indicate the
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
letters of the alphabet and so forth
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
and the time it would take us to relay
 
01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:14.789 align:start position:0%
and the time it would take us to relay
out

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the polling place by removing those
 
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.549 align:start position:0%
the polling place by removing those
electronic

01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
e-poll books and implementing the paper
 
01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:22.069 align:start position:0%
e-poll books and implementing the paper
checklist

01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
is about the time time that it would
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
take us to catch up
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
so that we have recorded on the paper
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
checklist all the voters who have
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
checked in prior to the failure of the e
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
poll book
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
so we do have a paper backup
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
that is going to provide us the
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
provides me as a moderator and it
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
provides the voters with an assurance
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
that if there is a failure in the e-poll
 
01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
that if there is a failure in the e-poll
books

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability with negligible
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
if any delay in the process
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
aside from changing over from electronic
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
to paper
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we can make that happen and we have
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
a paper backup
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
that will be used generally speaking if
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a question about the poll books
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
or in the case of a catastrophic failure
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
so again i just wanted to stress that in
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
our implementation
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
the electec books are all wired each to
 
01:07:20.559 --> 01:07:20.950 align:start position:0%
the electec books are all wired each to
what

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
each other um in milford we've been
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
using it for well over two years now
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
starting with a local election we've
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
used it in the primary
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
use in the general election and the
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
national election last fall
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
with no issues whatsoever
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
and as i point out if there was an issue
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
the change over time is negligible
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
and one last point um is that
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
if i if you take the pole books away the
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
they love them you know it's it's like
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
well first come first serve
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh first person in the in the polling
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
place it gets checked in and the next
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
one behind them they don't have to wait
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
in line with all the other m's or
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
c's or whatever so thank you for
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
listening to my uh
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
comments and i'm welcomed i'm happy to
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
take any questions

madam chairwoman that you may allow
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody on the committee
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
have any questions for
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much

for joining us today and giving us your
 
01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:27.749 align:start position:0%
for joining us today and giving us your
experience

01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned and i have on the list
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask again
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to ask if cordell jones
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't oh
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
can you hear that i can't you're you're
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
you're uh
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh code so i didn't realize it was all
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
welcome i clicked the wrong line when i

signed in
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay so uh one thing uh representative
 
01:08:54.719 --> 01:08:55.030 align:start position:0%
okay so uh one thing uh representative
griff

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
griff
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you everybody for um hearing
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
my testimony again
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
um uh for representative griffin when
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
you were asking about the
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
the um the or paper checklist
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's in reference to we are required
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
enough high-speed color printers on hand
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
or the paper checklist we opted for the
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
paper checklist because i did some
 
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
paper checklist because i did some
research

01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
into what the cost of having high-speed
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
printers that could print out
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
our 800-page 900-page
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
checklist in less than 50 minutes and it
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
would have cost us 24 000
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we opted to get use our volunteers
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
and fill out a paper checklist in the
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
back of the room
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that you asked about
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
was catastrophic failure
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
and um when i looked into the
 
01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
and um when i looked into the
catastrophic

01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
catastrophic
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
failure that happened with poll books
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the united states mariposa county is
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
the one that comes to mind
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
and their catastrophic failure was they
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
never set the poll books up correctly
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
to start in the morning so when people
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
arrived at six a.m
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
they had no backup and they in their id
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
department had not
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
put them together correctly so
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
i i sort of that was in uh preparation
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the election
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
i felt because i really looked into what
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
could be catastrophic failures
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
um on another note it was and i'm not
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
sure if manchester
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
did do a pilot with these but it was
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
bedford that did the um
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
the test um uh
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm i'm not aware of manchester
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually um ever doing one um it was
 
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.550 align:start position:0%
actually um ever doing one um it was
bedford

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
bedford
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and again um oh in the vulnerability
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
abilities i've been working a lot with
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
our elect tech book vendor
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
and um the volume
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
found some issues with the system but
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's no vulnerabilities on at least
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
the ones that we're using
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
with um it was cyberscout that
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
did the came to our site and they did a
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
security check while we were using the
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
whole books
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the the issues that are that they
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
found are all in the background in
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
auditing um and i guess i'd question
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether that's
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
necessary because the auditing that
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking at like today with a
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
paper checklist
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits that came up uh
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
during covet
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
was that i had a voter who came in and
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
voted with covid
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
i was able to go into the electronic
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
poll book
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
and see exactly what time they checked
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
in and who the
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
who the ballot clerks that were working
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
at that time which is a great feature
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the cyber scout who was looking
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
into the background of the system wants
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
it even more detailed than that but i
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean i could
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
our person that came and checked in with
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
kobit came in at 10 29
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know and um and we can tell exactly
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
what poll book they checked in on
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
um i i you know i i know everybody's
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
heard all this before
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%

hampshire municipal association
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and i just uh want to agree with
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh to the extent that i understand
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
the technology i certainly agree with
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
everything that others have said
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh the
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
municipal association is very much in
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
support of
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh i'm
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
i have talked to uh uh pete besseler
 
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
i have talked to uh uh pete besseler
from

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
milford quite a bit about it and he
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
raves all the time
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
and um i know that there are other towns
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
very interested in pursuing this maybe
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
not immediately but
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
in the near future um
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
the i i i think there are probably a lot
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
of towns smaller towns that would not
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
pursue this because there is a cost to
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
it the the
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of the poll books is borne by
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
the town so it's a
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
matter of uh figuring out whether it's
 
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.470 align:start position:0%
matter of uh figuring out whether it's
worth

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
the expense and the effort but for the
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
larger towns in the cities
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
um it really it really is a
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
time saving and uh and
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
many of our members would be interested
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
in pursuing it
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's all i'll all i have to say
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
unless anyone has any questions
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you does anybody have
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so thank you for
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
joining us that concludes the persons
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
who have signed up ahead of time to
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh michael o'brien joins us and he has
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
asked to speak to this bill good morning
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
mr o'brien
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative members of the
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is michael o'brien
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
um i just want to clear up a couple of
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
things um i'm sorry with pretty
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
strategies on behalf of my client
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
america votes
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
um i used to work directly for american
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
votes for for years and worked on
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
electronic pull books
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
um through the trial um and so
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
have uh some history with these couple
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
things uh one manchester never ran a
 
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:58.470 align:start position:0%
things uh one manchester never ran a
trial

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
just so folks know that um that never
 
01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
just so folks know that um that never
happened

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and so i know there was some question
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
um i think this might have been covered
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
but i do want to say to your question
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative griffin the full sentence
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
um in the proposed legislation
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
says that you can either do a printer a
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
high-speed printer
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
or a backup paper checklist so the
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
high-speed paper printer um
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
would cost the towns a lot of money and
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's why they decide not to do a lot
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
of times they want to do that but
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
either way you're gonna have something
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
that creates an effective backup right
 
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
that creates an effective backup right
away

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
um and then as far as some of the things
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
that we've heard about
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
problems with the e-pullbooks most of
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
these problems were
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
um driven by the user so we look back in
 
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.350 align:start position:0%
um driven by the user so we look back in
georgia

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
georgia
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
for instance there was one where they
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
tried to open up the polling place and
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
um you know there was no data on the
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
poll book but that was because the
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
person who runs their election i don't
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
know what the name of that person would
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
be in georgia here we call him the
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
moderator obviously
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
didn't upload the list to the pull book
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
so when he turned it on there was
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
nothing there
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's user error it's not public error
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and because in
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation we are requiring paper
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
checklists we can be rest assured that
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
if that were to happen
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that we would have a paper list there
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
ready to be used
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
additionally so folks know if there was
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
like a power outage or something that
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
happened in the town not only would we
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
have the paper
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
checklist but much like every electronic
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
device that we own
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
um these things run on batteries right
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
they don't if the power goes off they're
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
not going to turn off and
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
lose all connection to the world um they
 
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:31.750 align:start position:0%
lose all connection to the world um they
will

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
still be operational in use and again
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
because we're not using internet with
 
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.390 align:start position:0%
because we're not using internet with
them

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
we don't worry about losing the wi-fi et
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
but all of that also gets solved with
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
the backup paper checklist which this
 
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.709 align:start position:0%
the backup paper checklist which this
legislation

01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
mandates so i'm happy to answer any
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
questions um but just wanted to clear up
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
some things that i heard
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
during uh the question and answers from
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for mr
 
01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.270 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for mr
o'brien

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any hands mr o'brien this
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
is representative griffin
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
back to the catastrophic failure there
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
seems to be a lot of reliance based on
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that you can print
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
the list if the town has opted for a
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
high-speed printer
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh when there is a catastrophic failure
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
um is there any guarantee that a
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophic failure
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a shutdown of the pull
 
01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:24.630 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a shutdown of the pull
books

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
and at that point then printing a list
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
is impossible
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
or am i missing something i think
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
printing the list would be hard like if
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
you lost power
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
um you could still print it at city hall
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
and have the list delivered to the
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
polling place or town hall
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
have the list delivered to the polling
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
place i also do think that every clerk
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
that i've talked to
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it's been numerous who wants to use
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
pull books
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
um acknowledge that they would show up
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
to the polling place with a paper
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
checklist because they want that backup
 
01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.189 align:start position:0%
checklist because they want that backup
right

01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
just as just as you all wanna in the
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee no
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
moderator clerk who's running a polling
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
place is going to want
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
to run it without making sure that
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're prepared for anything
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
right and that's why our elections run
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
so smoothly because of all of their hard
 
01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.270 align:start position:0%
so smoothly because of all of their hard
work

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
and that's part of their work and they
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
understand that and so i you know i
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
i strongly suspect we'd see paper
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
backups um
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
ready for for any situation because they
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
know um they want to be ready as well
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from mr
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:24.630 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from mr
o'brien

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so thank you mr
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
like to speak to this bill

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
relative to electronic poll books
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anybody oh hold on i've
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
got a question it looks like
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh pam does somebody have their hand
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%

everyone yes thank you hi i'll be very
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
brief because so many
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh points have already been made in
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
my name is sherry farrell i'm the town
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
clerk here in london derry
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard joan in milford
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
really led the
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
the um force on this and i jumped on
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
board with her
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
based on the knowledge that she had and
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
as representative mcdonald stated
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
here in londonderry it's been a complete
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
success but
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
we have guidelines through our
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
phenomenal secretary of the state's
 
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
phenomenal secretary of the state's
office

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
um and as dave stated eloquently for us
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
they have watched and observed every
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
move that milford and londonderry has
 
01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.550 align:start position:0%
move that milford and londonderry has
made

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
and it's been a huge success um
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
everything that stated is accurate and
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh we're grateful
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
the towns that were mentioned that had
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
the early studies um were really more
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
just kind of exploration
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
points i'm not really jumping into the
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
reports and all that
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'll leave you with one cute story which
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
goes along with what pete from milford
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
had stated
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
about that you know if we're not allowed
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
to use these uh wonderful resources our
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
voters residents will
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
probably burst into tears here in
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
londonderry an 85 year old woman wrote
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
me a letter after
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
the general election and said that she
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
almost didn't come she voted every year
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
every time since she was 18 but getting
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
older she
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
just couldn't bear to come in and look
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
for that alphabetical
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
m again and wait in that line when you
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
know somebody else in a y
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
could just zip in and when she walked in
 
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.550 align:start position:0%
could just zip in and when she walked in
85

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
85
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
mind you and saw the pull pads and that
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
there were no
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
crazy letters anymore and you could go
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the first person that was open
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
she was elated and i'm just so grateful
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
for this new technology and it speaks to
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
what are
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
in what's coming into the future with
 
01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:45.590 align:start position:0%

described by mr vasilier
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%

keep the checklist
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh updated as you go through the day
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely and again you know this is i
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
know we can kind of tend to jump into
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
things and
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
new ideas but our secretary of state's
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
office through the years that's why we
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
are first in the nation and
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why here in election i i have
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
great pride in being part of the process
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
as a town clerk
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
because of the transparency and the
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
checks and balances that we have and yes
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
that is part of the requirement in us
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
getting involved in the test program
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we had to have that paper checklist
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
ready and available at all times and uh
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
and they actually came down and observed
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
in milford
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
and in londonderry to make you know sure
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we were doing it according to their
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines so
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know i have to thank them for their
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
support and that you know and it really
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
takes a village to make these things
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
happen one person can't think of
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
all the things that we need to take care
 
01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
all the things that we need to take care
of

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%

thank you comments at the same time uh
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
asking the absentee voters to provide a
 
01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.110 align:start position:0%
asking the absentee voters to provide a
photocopy

01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
photocopy
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
of a driver's license um much in the
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
same manner as we ask
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
people when they vote in person we've
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
modified that
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
very difficult for for some of our
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
voters to do that
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
so that if you look at the bill the way
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
it is right now
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
on page two um
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at uh lines
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
25 through pretty much the bottom of the
 
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.510 align:start position:0%
25 through pretty much the bottom of the
page

01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.550 align:start position:0%
page
um

01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
we tried to make that as easy on a voter
 
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:10.470 align:start position:0%
we tried to make that as easy on a voter
as

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
we could do it and still provide some
 
01:25:12.719 --> 01:25:14.070 align:start position:0%
we could do it and still provide some
information

01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
we ask that they put in if they have a
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
driver's license or
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
a non-driver id
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
that they put in the number in the state
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
or they can use the option of providing
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
the last four digits of the social
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
security number
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then we've got one other thing at
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
is some contact information that the
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
town clerks have
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
town clerk if you were married in the
 
01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
knows who married you who stood up with
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
you certainly they could
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know if you could verify that
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
information because the the records are
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
there for in every town clerk
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it may be the account number on your
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
your tax bill it may be
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
the account number on your water bill it
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
the name of the person that's running
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
the shelter
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
that you stayed at last night it may be
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
um any number of things
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
that the town clerk can can verify
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
and they have a wealth of information
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
that if you just let your imagination go
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh that can uniquely identify the person
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
again we're not trying to make it more
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to register
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
if they are the person that they say
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
writing down those last four digits of
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
the social security number is not hard
 
01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.590 align:start position:0%
the social security number is not hard
not

01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know but if they choose not to do
 
01:26:46.639 --> 01:26:46.950 align:start position:0%
you know but if they choose not to do
that

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
because uh they don't want to share that
 
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.629 align:start position:0%
because uh they don't want to share that
information

01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
there are other options out there that
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
they could uh use
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
um another one that comes to mind if
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
they registered a car
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
um certainly those records
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
are available to a lot of the town
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
clerks because they also function as the
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
tax collector
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
so again whatever the town clerk uh
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
can you know look up and verify
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine because the people who
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
should not be voting if someone were to
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
try to use your
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
your name your identity and try to vote
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to to weed out the
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
worst of the worst
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
and not make it difficult for the voter
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
not make it difficult for the town clerk
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
um the driver's license number and state
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
or run non-driver id and the
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
four digits of the social security
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
number are fields
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
in election net right now uh certainly
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
those could be
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
used that way again it's uh what we
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
think is a common sense
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
way of doing this and i mentioned
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
the u.s house bill hr1 before
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it still talks about being able to
 
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.229 align:start position:0%
and it still talks about being able to
use

01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
no more than the last four digits of the
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
social security and identification
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
and things so we think that this is a
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
common sense bill
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
provides us some indication
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
i tell people that if propriety would
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
allow i could go there with
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in my hands nothing in my
 
01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:36.310 align:start position:0%
nothing in my hands nothing in my
pockets

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
pockets
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
and go in and sign four affidavit and
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
affidavits and vote um that's still the
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
case this doesn't take that away from
 
01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
case this doesn't take that away from
them

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
but it allows you know communications
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
between the people
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so uh enough said and
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
if the good senator when he gets here
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
wants to add to that i'd be certainly
 
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.229 align:start position:0%
wants to add to that i'd be certainly
happy

01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
happy
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
but since i did write the amendment that
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
did this
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
i might be able to answer your questions
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
senator gray just for clarification
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
you uh mentioned registration a couple
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
of times this bill
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually has to do with applying for an
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot correct
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
correct but in the registration form
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
there is an option to include the
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
driver's license number and state
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the last four digits of the social
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
security so it
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
can work together with that application
 
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.030 align:start position:0%
can work together with that application
process

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time and provide information
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
that the voter may have already provided
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
when they registered and that being a
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
good check to make sure that
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
with very little trouble for the voter
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
and make it easy for everyone
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
that would be appreciated they enter
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
gray for taking the question
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
so just a point of clarification
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
if a voter was to pull an absentee
 
01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.669 align:start position:0%
if a voter was to pull an absentee
ballot

01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
request and didn't want to show their
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license or any other id
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
they could simply give their their name
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
in the last four digits of their social
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
security number
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
if they did that is there a way to let's
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
say somebody come in and said they were
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
frank smith
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
and just gave four digits of a social
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
security number
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
is that enough information to verify
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
that person is who they say they are
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
again we're because we are on the
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
application for the absentee ballot
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they are already registered in the
 
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.790 align:start position:0%
and they are already registered in the
system

01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
um then their name
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
address and other information which they
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
also would be providing
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
on that application form and if they
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
provided that information
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know at the time they did the
 
01:30:59.199 --> 01:31:00.550 align:start position:0%
uh you know at the time they did the
request

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
you notice that in the lower section of
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
the bill it also allows the
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh town clerk to contact
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
the state or the local uh office
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
police chief or whatever to verify
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
so if they did not provide say the uh
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
driver's license number in state
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
um and you know or did provide that
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't in election net then
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
they could certainly go and look that up
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any oh representative
 
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.790 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any oh representative
meerhead

01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
meerhead
 
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.629 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
senator

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask about the phrase one or
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
more of the following
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
on line 25 and
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
is one of the following sufficient or
 
01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.390 align:start position:0%
is one of the following sufficient or
are

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
voters expected to fill out
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
all four of the following if they can
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
one is sufficient some
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
may want to provide additional
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
information i
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't uh stop them from
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
the two easiest for the clerks
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be the driver's license numbered
 
01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
would be the driver's license numbered
state

01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the last four digits of the social
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
security number
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
which there are fields in the statewide
 
01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.510 align:start position:0%
which there are fields in the statewide
database

01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
often referred to as election net for
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
recording that information
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
and should they request ballots in the
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
future if they provided either one of
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
they could be verified with the
 
01:32:44.639 --> 01:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
they could be verified with the
information

01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
they previously provided may i have a
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up madam chair
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that voters applying for
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot will
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
be anxious that their absentee ballots
 
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
be anxious that their absentee ballots
count

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
count
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
as they're filling out this
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
and um and they may wonder whether
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
one of these is sufficient to
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
make their absentee ballot count um
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
if if one or two of these are actually
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
better ways
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
of making ensuring the ballot counts on
 
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.310 align:start position:0%
of making ensuring the ballot counts on
others

01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
have you thought about singling those
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
out so that an anxious voter can be
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
certain that their absentee ballot will
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh many many
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
many of these absentee ballots the
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
person is actually
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
standing in front of the town clerk at
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
the time uh
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
so if they provided their driver's
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
license there's a separate
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
section in state law that talks about
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
not having to do signature requirements
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
which are enjoined
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
right now us from doing that but
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
there is a statewide system that you can
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
go in and check on your absentee ballot
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's available on secretary of state's
 
01:34:08.239 --> 01:34:09.590 align:start position:0%
it's available on secretary of state's
website

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
and you can certainly do that remember
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's also a piece of legislation
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's coming before you
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that just expands upon the opening of
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope

uh in fact our organization has long
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
been very focused
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
on a nonpartisan civic engagement and
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
participation in our political process
 
01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:06.870 align:start position:0%
participation in our political process
we

01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
in our involvement in these issues is
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
nothing new
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
i have submitted written testimony which
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
i provided to the committee
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
and i would start by saying we do we do
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh and i understand uh the senator's
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
comments and the reasons for it but we
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
we we appear in opposition to the bill
 
01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
we we appear in opposition to the bill
because

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
really we oppose things that create any
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
barrier to voting
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i want to give you a perspective
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
that i think is important in this case
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
um the whole idea of a driver's license
 
01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:39.350 align:start position:0%
um the whole idea of a driver's license
or

01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
social security number we might all
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
assume that's an easy thing
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
to provide even the last four digits um
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
or that it's it's easy to figure out
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
on a utility bill i don't think that's
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily so
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and it is certainly more burdensome
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
than what we currently do and and i
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
believe i understand
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
why the the effort is happening now to
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
do what we're doing
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
but it would also say that some 30 to
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
40 percent of granite staters voted
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
absentee in the last
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
election by virtue of uh the pandemic
 
01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:15.590 align:start position:0%
election by virtue of uh the pandemic
and

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan legislation which um
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
that both chambers passed and the
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
governor supported
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
we also supported that legislation uh
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
and certainly
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
in any given year it's about 10 percent
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the electorate from the best
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
information i have from the secretary of
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
votes by absentee so it is really
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
important that there is no
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
there is no impediment to to
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
voting and i think to the extent that
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
this creates one
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
like somebody couldn't find their
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
identification or their license or they
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
could not recall the number
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
or they they didn't have their social
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
security card or the last four digits of
 
01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
security card or the last four digits of
it

01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's a barrier it's a burden and you
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
know i would come back to the point of
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
these are fundamental rights and there
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
are two that i really highlight and you
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
all know well and
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
in you know new hampshire we're blessed
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
to have a great
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
a great house and a great senate and and
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
our elections are run well here
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
um but article 11 is is amongst the
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
rights that we enjoy is the right to
 
01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:18.550 align:start position:0%
rights that we enjoy is the right to
vote

01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and any anything that makes it more
 
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.229 align:start position:0%
and and any anything that makes it more
difficult

01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
for a person to enjoy that franchise in
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire particularly since
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
we really had in the past very
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
uneventful elections i mean in the in
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
and again this according to secretary of
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
state's office i know we have one town
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
we're having a recount
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
but generally the elections were secure
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
and well run
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
i mean the vast majority of it
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
and you know article 11 really talks
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the fundamental
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
right to vote is a right that is so
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
important and if people
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
exercise that right via absentee ballot
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
they ought to be able to do with new
 
01:40:58.239 --> 01:40:59.189 align:start position:0%
they ought to be able to do with new
hampshire

01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
easily and readily and without
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
impediment and
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's another there's another
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
article we talk about
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
with much less frequency and it really
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't been changed since 1754 and it's
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
about the inculcation of social virtues
 
01:41:12.639 --> 01:41:12.950 align:start position:0%
about the inculcation of social virtues
and

01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
you know we we residents and citizens of
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i'm a native of the state
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
was born here and been here an awfully
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
we look to our elected officials to to
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
really safeguard
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
the fundamental principles of the
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
constitution and what is really more
 
01:41:29.679 --> 01:41:30.950 align:start position:0%
constitution and what is really more
fundamental

01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
then the right to cast one's ballot um i
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i do talk about uh article 38 and i
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that we talk about it a lot
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
but in a time when these are these are
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
things and and
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
concepts that were drafted you know
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years ago
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
to really make sure that we weave
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
tightly into the fabric of
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
our of our democracy those things that
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
we all hold dear
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
so um with those two thoughts and the
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
third thought is
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
there might be some privacy act concerns
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
under federal law
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm not going to say with the def
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
with certainty that there are
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
i would just flag it for the committee's
 
01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
i would just flag it for the committee's
consideration

01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and it may be nullified by the fact
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
that you're only requiring four
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
digits of the social security number but
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
nonetheless it's something worth
 
01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
nonetheless it's something worth
contemplation

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
contemplation
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons um we would ask
 
01:42:18.239 --> 01:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons um we would ask
that

01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
that this uh not pass out of committee
 
01:42:21.679 --> 01:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
that this uh not pass out of committee
and

01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh without certainly further changes to
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
be sure that there's no impediments to
 
01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
be sure that there's no impediments to
uh

01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
to a granite stater's right to vote
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
are there questions from mr fahey
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%

and um if you're aware of
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
any way that the current proposed
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislation would violate that could you
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
supply that
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
specific information to the committee
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%

01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
sure uh i think i i did put some written
 
01:43:22.239 --> 01:43:23.189 align:start position:0%
sure uh i think i i did put some written
testimony

01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative in and and that would be
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
the extent of the position i i didn't
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
say it with the certainty that it was a
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
violation i simply
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
flagged it for the committee's um uh
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
consideration as you go about
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
considering this legislation
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
and then secondarily to go back to your
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
point it's not necessarily about
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
the the social security number
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative it's it's whether people
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
have the ability to recall it
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
and to produce that information without
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
having to maybe
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
go to the go to the social security
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
office or
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
go through additional steps to provide
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
that information that may not may be
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
readily available to you or i but it may
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
not be readily available to some
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that was the position we take
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question any other
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
of our committee members for mr fahey
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr fahey do you
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
i just got the state constitution and
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
started reading article 38
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say that the people have
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
the right to require their law givers
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
to exact and to to form and execute the
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
laws necessary for the good
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
administration of government
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
government government wouldn't this fall
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
under that and i just want to make a
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
note that
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i recently cared for my elderly
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law for
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
many many years and at my fingertips at
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
all times
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
was a file that says important id and
 
01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.950 align:start position:0%
was a file that says important id and
papers

01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
papers
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
i can i could get it at a moment's
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
notice because i had to
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
every time she had a doctor's
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
appointment or medical care
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
was that is this something that's too
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
burdensome for
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
your members thank you for the question
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative the last few sentences i
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
didn't out here
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
i i did hear your comments i could speak
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
to them i just want to make sure i'm
 
01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.350 align:start position:0%
to them i just want to make sure i'm
responsive

01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
something about our members i was just
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
reading from the
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
state constitution from article 38 which
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
which requires of lawmakers to form and
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
execute laws necessary for the good
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
administration of governance and
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this fall under that
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
with suitable amendment it certainly
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
would representative um
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i think i would i would hearken back
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the beginning of article 38
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
and it says a frequent recurrence to the
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles of the
 
01:45:47.679 --> 01:45:49.109 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles of the
constitution

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
um which is the first sentence and the
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
drafters were
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
not ones to um be reckless with language
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
so i do think with suitable amendment
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
and and i recognize that you were going
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
about the work of the people
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that the work of the people
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
and the charge of article 38 would
 
01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:07.669 align:start position:0%
and the charge of article 38 would
require

01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
further questions further questions from
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee members from mr
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
faye mr fahey i actually have a couple
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
of questions well i think i'm welcoming
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
you back to our committee is that right
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard from you on other bills
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
right so welcome
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
you said that you're um live here in new
 
01:46:31.199 --> 01:46:32.229 align:start position:0%
you said that you're um live here in new
hampshire

01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
um my recollection is you might have
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
been out of this state for a few years
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
and um i'm saying that because i'm
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
looking at your testimony and talk about
 
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:41.750 align:start position:0%
looking at your testimony and talk about
sb

01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
sb
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
54 um requiring a reason
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
for voting absentee ball
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
for taking an absentee ballot are you
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
aware that's currently in the statute
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing in this bill that
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative i'm speaking only to the
 
01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.310 align:start position:0%
representative i'm speaking only to the
requirement

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
of an additional information to
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
be provided so as to exercise the right
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
to vote via absentee ballot
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and no i have not been out of the
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
state i was i was i've been
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
here very much i haven't gone very far
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
frankly for quite a while
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
all right well that's good because your
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
letter says specifically
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
that sb 54 requires certain things and
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
those are currently in statute
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to clear that up um
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
as to your comments as to um
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
the constitution you did a lot of work
 
01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
the constitution you did a lot of work
on

01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
article 11 and all the amendments so
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
um so my final question my question
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
would be then
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
um is there anything specific in your
 
01:47:48.239 --> 01:47:49.750 align:start position:0%
um is there anything specific in your
testimony

01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
that comes from the organization that
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
you represent aarp
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of constitutional
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
arguments but i'm curious to see whether
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
aarp um based on its members has
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
something specific
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
well i would thank you for that question
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair in
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
two two points uh i wouldn't be
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
testifying if the testimony was not
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with aarp policy on voting
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and okay so my testimony is entirely
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with the aarp
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
policy on ensuring that the franchise is
 
01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:20.550 align:start position:0%
policy on ensuring that the franchise is
not

01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh denied or made more difficult to to
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
any voter in the united states
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly those who are members and
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
those who are over 50 plus
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
um and so i would speak to that issue
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
and then secondarily i mean certainly
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know people
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
our members have you know great concern
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh about
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
about their ability to vote and to vote
 
01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.550 align:start position:0%
about their ability to vote and to vote
safely

01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
safely
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
and to exercise their right um that's
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
something that that we have been
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
involved with for
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
for years and certainly as recently as
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
last year when we did i did indeed
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
testify before your committee
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
all right i think did i answer your
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
question man i'm sure if not i'm happy
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
to go further
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
no that's fine if i have a further
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
question i'll just follow up with you
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um any other questions from
 
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.709 align:start position:0%
thank you um any other questions from
panelists

01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
all right i'm seeing none so thank you
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
mr fahey
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this bill is
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
see your your chair has to take her
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for joining us
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
ms says yeah hello
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can yeah
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair for
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i would like to bring in a few points
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
first of all the language when i read it
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
one or more
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the following um that should be
 
01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:54.950 align:start position:0%
of the following um that should be
provided

01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
that was confusing even for me and
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
created some anxiety
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
so i i wonder if it would be better to
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
simplify the language and just say
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
one of the following since this is
 
01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.790 align:start position:0%
one of the following since this is
sufficient

01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
not requiring um secondly
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
i would like to mention that recalling
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
social security number
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
is not as easy for some people
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
as it would be for others my mom is over
 
01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.470 align:start position:0%
as it would be for others my mom is over
65

01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
65
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
she's 66 and she always has difficulty
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
recalling her social security number
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
so it may seem like it would be
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
something straightforward but even like
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
like account number for some uh
 
01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.070 align:start position:0%
like account number for some uh
utilities

01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
or other information might be cumbersome
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
and would certainly
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
add additional barrier um to request an
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
absolute vote
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
um my parents are naturalized citizens
 
01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.550 align:start position:0%
um my parents are naturalized citizens
and

01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
even following my basic instructions for
 
01:50:55.599 --> 01:50:56.149 align:start position:0%
even following my basic instructions for
them

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
is um requiring some level
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
of you know reading comprehending
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
but any additional information always
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
always adds additional layer of
 
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:08.870 align:start position:0%
always adds additional layer of
complexity

01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
which should certainly be determined and
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
i can imagine that
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
is more difficult for elderly people or
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
those with
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities as well and uh the last
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
point is um i think these bills are
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
requiring the signature of the person
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
who is assisting
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
in filling out the form um
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
which would also be difficult because
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes assistance can be provided
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
over the phone
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
or the elderly person might be living
 
01:51:40.239 --> 01:51:40.870 align:start position:0%
or the elderly person might be living
alone

01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
and they might be showing this form or
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
discussing it through
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
like what we call tele you know
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
communication video
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
something like that and so that person
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
may not be able to sign the form
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
which would certainly be additional
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
barrier so i would like to speak in
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill um and i agree with many of the
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
points that were raised
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
previously by um um
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%

01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%

01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%

01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thanks a lot and

and that is the last person that i have
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%

01:52:36.639 --> 01:52:37.669 align:start position:0%
on this bill is there anybody else in

01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
who wants to speak on this bill
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
there now i'm unmuted i'm representing
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
timothy oregon i represent grafford
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
county district six
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of durham and madbury
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
um durham is in fact a college town so i
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
was pleased to see that they did
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
recognize the reality that uh
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
drivers licenses from other states
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
thanks to a
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
interstate compact which we between
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
all the other states and actually all
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
the canadian provinces one driver's
 
01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
the canadian provinces one driver's
license

01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
is punchable with another so that's
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
something that we lose
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
track of a lot like we're losing track
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
of it and this is a
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
different this is not within the purview
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
committee but like even over like
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
the vaccine uh rollout and certainly
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
over voting so
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
um i i testified against
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
the original version of this bill in the
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
senate uh election law municipal affairs
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee and this
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
isn't quite as the original version of
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
ill was
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
even more uh misguided but this is a
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary unnecessary bill um
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
and this also requires people to write
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
down information on the absentee ballot
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
form which they
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily want to share with
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
all the people who
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh look at a special cajon election nets
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure the security and lexington
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
is good but still there's people on
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
there who you might not necessarily want
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
to know your driver's license um that's
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
usually between me and the dmv that's
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
why concerned or even the last four
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
digits of my social security number
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not much younger than the young
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
woman's uh
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
grandma mother and i'm pretty sure i
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
know the last four digits of my social
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
security number
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
but i personally often mix them up with
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
the last four digits of my credit card
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
number if i was asked so that's uh
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think there's there's no need for us
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
there isn't really any procedure for
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
what to do if the clerk gets
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
what appears to be a bogus driver's
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
license number or both a social security
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
number and i don't
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
by what senator gray said i don't think
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
they really have any
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think they can just necessarily
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
look up that data in the other files and
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
verify it so
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
um i this bill is just one more attempt
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
to overcomplicate
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
the electoral process if anybody was
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing this on a large scale
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know having fictitious uh absentee
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
ballot uh
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
applications that would be caught anyway
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
despite what people say the attorney
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
general secretary of the state's office
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
do pay a lot of attention
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
to uh voter fraud which also of course
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
is a felony so it's very risky so if
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
somebody was doing
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
multiple fake absentee valid
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
applications i'm quite confident they
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be caught i'm quite confident that
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
they could be published
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
they could be punished very severely
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
anyway so all this
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
thing doesn't just make but it's already
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
a difficult process more difficult for
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
average citizens you just want to uh do
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
their civic duty and
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
vote so i would say uh i would say you
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
should uh find this bill any speed to
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislate and um
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if any significant the fact
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
that you're hearing it today instead of
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
putting it off till after our
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
after uh april 7th through 9th if
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
indeed you are planning to fast track
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
this and execute today so it can be on
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
next week i hope your decision will be
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
something other than ought to pass like
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
preferably inexpedited to legislate so
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's basically what i have to say
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
about the bill so
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
i think thanks for recognizing me sorry
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit slow
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
getting unmuted and i suppose i can
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if anybody wants to
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
ask me anything
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
there are some people who want to ask a
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking that question
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
um do you see any need
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
for assuring that the identity of a
 
01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.790 align:start position:0%
for assuring that the identity of a
person

01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot remotely
 
01:57:07.599 --> 01:57:08.070 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot remotely
uh

01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
that we do make some assurance that that
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
person is who
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
he or she says she here she is or do you
 
01:57:16.239 --> 01:57:16.790 align:start position:0%
he or she says she here she is or do you
think

01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
we should just simply take their word
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
for it that they are that person
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
um i think i'll just say i think the i
 
01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
um i think i'll just say i think the i
think

01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
the uh protections are already in place
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
are sufficient i know
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
my town clerk and every count clerk
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
takes your job very seriously i know the
 
01:57:33.199 --> 01:57:34.310 align:start position:0%
takes your job very seriously i know the
supervisor

01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
are checklists and they're uh they're
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
trained to detect fraudulent activity
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
and this bill that passed would not help
 
01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:40.950 align:start position:0%
and this bill that passed would not help
them

01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
do that because there's probably still
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
ways that a criminal
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know a sufficiently the turbine
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
criminal um
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
could still like could still try to gain
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
the system so i
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think all this will do is like confuse
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
a few people who
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh who are maybe struggling with their
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork anyway but are still
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
they'll still have the right to vote and
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
still should vote and also um
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
it also allows orders as you provide
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
certain information that's put in a uh
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
a form that uh that probably
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
formed and maybe other unauthorized
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
people can see in the database
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't i don't
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily 100 trust
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
but i know it's necessary so that you're
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
putting information
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
leaving lying around like i know i most
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
sensible people like
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
try not to provide uh when unnecessary
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
so i would say i would say the
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
protections we already have are are
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient and certainly there's no
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh like what some people said there's no
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of massive
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
fictitious absentee ballots out there so
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying what we already have is
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient that our i trust my town
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
clerk i chose my supervisor the
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
checklist you know and i
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
trust those in other communities
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
including rochester so that
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's my answer
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm talking to myself the host i got
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
reminded that i'm
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
i was muted to cough and didn't unmute
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative growing
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes follow up please representative
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
growing go ahead
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
um representative morgan i'm from
 
01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.149 align:start position:0%
um representative morgan i'm from
rochester

01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
rochester
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
a city of a little over 30 000 people
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
and our clerk in rochester is very
 
01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
and our clerk in rochester is very
capable

01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
capable
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
but i doubt if she knows 30 000
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
people by name or by voice uh
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to recognize if someone
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
applying for an absentee ballot
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
is uh john smith or is not john smith
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
how how is the safeguard there to assure
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
that person is again who he or she says
 
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
she is
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know me mike my town clerk
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
and also well actually our assistant
 
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.310 align:start position:0%
and also well actually our assistant
congressman

02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
congressman
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
every community 15 000 people have to
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
decide comparable and they
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're pretty with it so i think
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
they don't actually need to know
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
everybody my name or site and i don't
 
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:18.870 align:start position:0%
everybody my name or site and i don't
know

02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
like why why writing down this
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
information is going to really
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
help them that much but they know what's
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
normal and what's not they know
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
they know when they're being scammed and
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
when they're not being scammed so i i
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
i just uh i think i trust them even in
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
the larger larger communities
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
so even uh i would even trust the city
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horgan
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative mooney
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if you know uh if
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's acceptable
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh for example if a voter's ballot
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
were to be nullified by an invalid
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot are you familiar with
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
that scenario
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
or do you know of any acceptability
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
related to that
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
i'm probably not the right person the
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
tracked you do uh if you do show up
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
at the polling place after there's an
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot in your name the uh
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we've been modifying that somewhat
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
in order to require
 
02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
more processing um you can cast the
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
ballot in person so that's probably
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
something you might wreck more at the
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state but that's i mean
 
02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:35.109 align:start position:0%
secretary of state but that's i mean
that's

02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
something that can happen even if you
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
have this bill and certainly they do
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
publish the names of people who applied
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
for absentee ballots and that's
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why they do it in
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
case there's a either a clerical error
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
or an attempted fraud so that's uh
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's a concern already so that's uh
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
um i really uh i know uh
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office secretary
 
02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
state's office do actually do
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh pursue voter fraud and i've actually
 
02:02:03.199 --> 02:02:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh pursue voter fraud and i've actually
uh

02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't recall seeing that particular that
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
particular scenario playing out but um
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
you should uh
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
i mean that question probably is better
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
directed at them and certainly
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
i understand the concern that certainly
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
would be good reason not to
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
not to pass on this bill today if that
 
02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
was indeed uh
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
what you what what the chair or whoever
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
what the share had in mind but that's uh
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's
 
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's already that's already an issue
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that can happen this bill
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
isn't going to prevent it it's just
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to make things harder for the
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
clerks and harder for the voters so
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horrigan
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan you mentioned
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
that you have some trouble with
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh remembering your social security
 
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
uh remembering your social security
number

02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
what about the other documents that
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
senator gray
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
brought up that could be used if you
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
discuss with your town clerk um
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
would you do you find those impossible
 
02:03:06.719 --> 02:03:07.750 align:start position:0%
would you do you find those impossible
to

02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
access as well i just you'd only need
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i mean i wouldn't be that big a deal
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
for me but i'm uh i'm a relative
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
i mean sometimes i'm a little spacey but
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's lots of people
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
lots of people whose memories are worse
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
than mine or whose life support
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
disorderly than mine so i
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
just uh i mean personally for me
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know i could have my driver's
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
license with me at all times i actually
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
despite what i said i
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
am fairly confident that i do remember
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
my social security number but there's
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
have a harder time with that with me but
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
they still have the right to vote
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're still capable of making a
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
diligent decision and also
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
frankly much as i love my town clerk
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
and she's very trustworthy i don't
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to have to tell her
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
what my driver's license number is i
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
even though i'm sure she could look it
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
up in the dmv database i don't
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to follow
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
left where this is my social security
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
number are the context where
 
02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary you know i don't
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to burden her with all
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
that stuff or trust her with all that
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
stuff so that's uh
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh all this does would stop for
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
individual voters uh you know it's
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
an organized attempt to vote or fraud
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
would still be
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
carried out without it but it would uh
 
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.750 align:start position:0%
carried out without it but it would uh
fire

02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
fire
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
it would be i'm quite confident it would
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
be caught and it's a pretty serious
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
felony if you do do it anyways i don't
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
think anyone's
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to falsify mrs jones's uh absentee
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
ballot just to cast a second vote i
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a fantasy
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i you know once again also those
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
concerns should probably be best to be
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general the secretary
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
of state's office who
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
probably are listening in on this and
 
02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:50.069 align:start position:0%
probably are listening in on this and
also

02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is also something you can bring up
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
in some community so
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know you wanna i think if
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
you do wanna move forward with this
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
ability it's a bad idea you certainly
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't wanna pass it as it is today you
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
wanna verify right thank you
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
is there are there any further questions
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so thank you
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative horgan
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
also asking to speak to this bill is
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can hi okay thank you
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to bring up so as part
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
as a co-chair of the new hampshire city
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
and town clerks legislative committee
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
we are not in support of this bill um
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
we i do have a suggestion that i'll
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
bring up at the end
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
but the first thing um
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
the the few concerns is number one we
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
have no access to verify
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
anybody's social security number we just
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't have it it's not an election that
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's no way so anybody could write
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
any four numbers down they want and
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know so i don't know what that's
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
going to prove for verification
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
um secondly driver's license numbers
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
changed in the last two years
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
so if you've been a voter for 10 or 15
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
20 years the driver's license number
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
in election net is not the drivers
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
license number that is on your license
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
right now so again
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
verifying a driver's license number
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
would be difficult
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
so the way and and i will do want to
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
state that you know in
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we recently had record numbers all
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
of us of uh absentee voting
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
and um i have to say in milford we've
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
we've have never had a fraudulent
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
absentee voter
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
to date one of the things that prevents
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
when somebody mails in an absentee
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
ballot request
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
that request is mailed to the address on
 
02:06:48.239 --> 02:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
that request is mailed to the address on
record

02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
so in my mind that is the way that we
 
02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
so in my mind that is the way that we
prevent

02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
fraud from those absentee ballot request
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
forms that are
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
mailed in or dropped off prior to
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
having the ballots ready and my
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
if we'd like to amend this bill would be
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
that we just
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
add in that if you are going to request
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot in person
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
and vote that day get your ballot that
 
02:07:14.880 --> 02:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
and vote that day get your ballot that
day

02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
that they just show us an id there is no
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
requirement right now
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
to show an id when you pick up an
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot in person and and i
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
think that that would that would address
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
senator gray and senator guida's um
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
issues with that um because any absentee
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
ballots then that we are mailing out are
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
going to the
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
mailing address on record and any
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots requested in person
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
the person would be required to show you
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
id and i'll and i'll tell you nobody
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
would have a problem with that because
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
everybody that
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
shows up in town hall um to request an
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot when we have them
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
they always want to show me an id
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
because they're just so used to doing it
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
at voting
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that my concern
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
about having the last four of somebody's
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
social security number and their
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license number on those
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request forms
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
is that so many times people come into
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
town hall
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
and they'll fill out an absentee ballot
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
request form and they
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
just leave it anywhere so then their
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
private info is out there
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
for somebody else to pick up and find or
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're mailed to the wrong address
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else in town hall opens it um
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
again that's private information and
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i just think that by requiring that
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
a photo show an id when doing it in
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
person would
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
would help relieve those issues
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
and again i thank you for listening to
 
02:08:40.159 --> 02:08:41.189 align:start position:0%
and again i thank you for listening to
my

02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%

02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%

also uh i saw a hand raised to speak on
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
this was
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%

02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:28.390 align:start position:0%
your time spent on these important
issues

02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
again i wanted to thank my colleague
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
joan um for speaking before me
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
um we heard some comments about folks
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
looking out for the interests of voters
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
which obviously is where your
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
your emphasis should be but i wanted to
 
02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.669 align:start position:0%
your emphasis should be but i wanted to
selfishly

02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
selfishly
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
stand up for the interests of our the
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
town clerk who
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
um when i read the proposed legislation
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
i was quite
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
taken aback for how much discretion now
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
is being put on the shoulders of the
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
town clerk
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
um uh where because in fact it says
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
give us one of these two things and if
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
not talk to your town clerk
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i i'm just concerned that um
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
a bj's card um if somebody writes down
 
02:10:10.149 --> 02:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
their bj's number for me
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
might be okay but a bj's number for joan
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i i just think there's
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
too much uncertainty about well what
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to prove and then um
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
senator gray indicated that we have
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
access to a wealth of information
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
and absolutely that is true but we are
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
also sworn to use that information
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
only for the purposes for which we've
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
been granted that access
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
so we can't go diving into the motor
 
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
so we can't go diving into the motor
vehicle

02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
database and check out a plate number or
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
we can't go diving into the vital
 
02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
we can't go diving into the vital
records

02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
um database just to see who married
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
somebody because we're curious so i
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit a little bit concerned
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
about how we practically would
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
would um confirm this information and
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
then i i
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
did take to heart the question um that
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
one of your um
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
panel raised about do we think there's a
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
need to identify somebody who is
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
requesting an
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and i think the
 
02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:14.069 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and i think the
application

02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
again is is signed under penalty of
 
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.510 align:start position:0%
again is is signed under penalty of
perjury

02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
perjury
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
we do um we do confirm that they are a
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
registered voter and as jones said
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
we do confirm the address that it's
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
being mailed to an address
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we have on record or if they've
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
asked us to mail it to their home in
 
02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
asked us to mail it to their home in
florida

02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
florida
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
they have to um they have to list their
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
hanover domicile and so we have that
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
as well and then if this is truly
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
designed to catch the worst of the worst
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
as we heard
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
when the bill was introduced um again i
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
i i i think this is adding another
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
level of complexity and um frustrating
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
exchange between the clerk
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
and the voter um that again
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
we end up having to sort of try to do
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
our best to navigate
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and and i'm just not sure
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we're creating that friction for
 
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.229 align:start position:0%
that we're creating that friction for
any

02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
um any problem that's been illustrated
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
as worthy of a solution
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for taking my comments
 
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i would urge the committee
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
to um to not support this bill
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:30.950 align:start position:0%
in the committee who would have a
question

a question
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
the quick question uh thank you uh i was
 
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:48.310 align:start position:0%
the quick question uh thank you uh i was
wondering

02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
where you're from and what town you
 
02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
where you're from and what town you
represent

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
oh sure sure i'm from the town of
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
hanover and we have about
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
ten thousand people on our um voter
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
checklist and so
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
so we most of our absentee ballot
 
02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.109 align:start position:0%
so we most of our absentee ballot
requests

02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
requests
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
especially through the pandemic in fact
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
were coming through
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
via email and so um so again and i would
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
heartily agree with um ms daigle that
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
when people
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
appear before us they fully expect to
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
show us a photo id
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
um again i'm not i'm not sure um
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
other than the the the checks we have in
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
place with
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
um the addressing and the knowing that
 
02:13:28.159 --> 02:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
um the addressing and the knowing that
they're

02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
a registered voter and that the voters
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
signing under penalty of perjury
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
um again how we would confirm remotely
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
um a bj's card so
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%

who would like to
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
speak to the bill that we're having a
 
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it is senate bill
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
54 relative to the ballot application
 
02:14:03.199 --> 02:14:06.870 align:start position:0%
54 relative to the ballot application
form

02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anybody so uh
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
senator gray uh thank you madam chairman
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to uh respond to
 
02:14:16.639 --> 02:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to uh respond to
representative

02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
mooney's question about absentee ballots
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
and voting in person
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh right now that the state law
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
does not allow you to start processing
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots until
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
at least two hours after the polls open
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
those ballots both the absentee and the
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
regular ballots
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
are processed through the same checklist
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
and there's two conditions
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh where you would not be able to vote
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
in person
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh had an absentee ballot been processed
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
and that those things about processing
 
02:14:53.599 --> 02:14:54.310 align:start position:0%
and that those things about processing
them

02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
is if you've opened the internal
 
02:14:56.079 --> 02:14:57.430 align:start position:0%
is if you've opened the internal
envelope

02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
or you've marked the red av on the
 
02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
or you've marked the red av on the
checklist

02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
at the time okay those two things
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
would preclude the voter who might want
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
and not have his absentee ballot counted
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
um from uh actually uh going through and
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
voting in person
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
so if that answers your question i hope
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
that you're good
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i'll keep my bj's card in my pocket
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
because you guys wouldn't be able to
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
verify that anyway so
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
there you go any other
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions for senator gray or senator
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
geider i believe is still with us
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
he is and a last call for comments from
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative home o'brien thank you i
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question for senator gray
 
02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
i have a question for senator gray
is

02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
when you were writing this bill or
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill in the
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
did it come up that that that the town
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
clerks would not be able to verify some
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
of this information
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that makes me wonder is it is it
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
requested because
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the future should there be an
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
investigation it may be good to have
 
02:16:18.079 --> 02:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
investigation it may be good to have
this

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
information to verify things
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh let me answer this way
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
um that section near the end of the bill
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
the bill well i guess i do have it up on
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
my screen
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um we
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
specifically in there allow the clerks
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
to go in
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
and look at the dmv or contact
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
their local or state police to get the
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
information about the driver's license
 
02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:50.950 align:start position:0%
information about the driver's license
number

02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay and but not everyone has
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire driver's license has
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
been pointed out by our representative
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
from durham
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh and not everyone has a voter
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
uh i should say a non-driver id
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh so what other things are out there um
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
last four digits of the social security
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
number is something right now
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
that i don't know how a town clerk would
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
verify that
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh unless that information was provided
 
02:17:27.990 --> 02:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
at the time that they registered
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
but once provided
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
it would be entered into election net
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
and should someone
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
try to do that again with a different
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
set of four digits
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
then we certainly would be able to start
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
asking questions that those two numbers
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
because as far as i know my social
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
security number has
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
never changed okay
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
but remember that other section uh
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
hey there are so many things that
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh there are that the clerks do have
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
access to
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
and this bill um
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
maybe it needs to be strengthened in
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
that section but
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
this bill provides the authorization for
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
to go in and verify um
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
who married myself and my wife if i
 
02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
who married myself and my wife if i
chose

02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
chose
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
to uh to to use that as the information
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh who was my best man who was the um
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know maid of honor all those things
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
are on
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
the marriage certificate that is on file
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the state system uh i mean there is
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
so many things out there that could be
 
02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.190 align:start position:0%
so many things out there that could be
done

02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
now this is also
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
will be trained by the secretary of
 
02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:49.990 align:start position:0%
will be trained by the secretary of
state

02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i imagine that one of the things
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
that they will train
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
is that failing all else they can sign
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
an affidavit
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
i would be a little suspicious that that
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
would be the only thing that they could
 
02:19:02.719 --> 02:19:03.509 align:start position:0%
would be the only thing that they could
do

02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
but again that's not my suspicions that
 
02:19:06.719 --> 02:19:07.429 align:start position:0%
but again that's not my suspicions that
uh

02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
that are going to rule on this this you
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
know place
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh but you know i think that there
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
are yes the the last four digits of
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
social security number
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
um are something that we do have as an
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
option to provide on the
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
registration card it is not mandatory
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that's the best answer i can give you
 
02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:33.190 align:start position:0%
so that's the best answer i can give you
representative

02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative lane thank you madam
 
02:19:36.319 --> 02:19:36.790 align:start position:0%
representative lane thank you madam
chair

02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
personally i'll get this to a question
 
02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
personally i'll get this to a question
but

02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
i have grave issues with requiring
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
people to divulge any
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
of their social security number it was
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
it is not an identification number it is
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
used by the federal government
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
and creditors to identify you
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
for income and to make sure that you get
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
the correct benefits under the social
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
security act
 
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
why are we using it for voter
 
02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
why are we using it for voter
identification

02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
identification
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the intent of a social security
 
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.630 align:start position:0%
it's not the intent of a social security
number

02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
why did you choose that we are
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
providing um the opportunity to use
 
02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.389 align:start position:0%
providing um the opportunity to use
something

02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay now i'm uh assuming that
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
that you either own or rent a home here
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay if you rent the home and you can
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
provide the name
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the person who owns that residence
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is something that the clerk can
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
verify they have the property tax
 
02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.349 align:start position:0%
verify they have the property tax
records

02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
if you own a home then certainly you
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
have a tax bill
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
or other information so if it were
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the only piece of information that you
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
could provide
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'd say yeah we probably are going too
 
02:20:57.359 --> 02:20:59.030 align:start position:0%
i'd say yeah we probably are going too
far

02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
far
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
but you know we're not
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
we we have it open so that you can
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
plethora of information
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
and just choose one of them just choose
 
02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
and just choose one of them just choose
one

02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow-up please follow up
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh senator i guess in the drafting of
 
02:21:19.439 --> 02:21:20.389 align:start position:0%
uh senator i guess in the drafting of
this

02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
um well what if the town
 
02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
every town court does things differently
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
what if my town clerk
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
only wants the social security number or
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
my driver's id
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the correct number on
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
it because when i registered
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
before it's changed and you or i or
 
02:21:38.479 --> 02:21:39.190 align:start position:0%
before it's changed and you or i or
anyone

02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
else that finds that out should report
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
that to the secretary of state so that
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
that town clerk can be
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
re-educated correct but i want to get an
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot because i
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying we're putting a lot on
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
the boater or
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
putting obstacles in front of the voter
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i will desist at that point
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative muirhead
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i want to just
 
02:22:06.399 --> 02:22:07.670 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i want to just
clarify

02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
if i may senator is this bill asking for
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
information as proof of identity that we
 
02:22:14.319 --> 02:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
information as proof of identity that we
know

02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
town clerks do not possess i such as the
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
last four digits of the social security
 
02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
last four digits of the social security
number

02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
um they would not normally have the
 
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
last four digits of the social security
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
number that i know of
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
unless it was provided as voluntary
 
02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:32.790 align:start position:0%
unless it was provided as voluntary
information

02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
on the application but it was a piece of
 
02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:38.550 align:start position:0%
on the application but it was a piece of
information

02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh that uh most people have
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
access to um you know my grandsons
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
um by the time they were six their
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
father had to
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
file uh the taxes and they already had a
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
social security number at the tender age
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
of six months
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh so again you know
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
is this thing perfect um no it's not
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh does it uh you know we're making a
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
about this you know the constitution
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of things
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
constitution provides that um
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
just as a comparison um the right to
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
bear arms
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
all right what do i have to do if i want
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
to exercise my right to bear arms
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
i have to go through background checks i
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
have to provide information
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
i have to i have to i have to i have to
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
well now we look at the constitution and
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
says you've got the right to vote
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
well when that constitution was written
 
02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:41.830 align:start position:0%
well when that constitution was written
um

02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't it that it was only landowners
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
that were males that
 
02:23:49.270 --> 02:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know could have the right to vote
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
things have changed over time
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
and again i think that there is a
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
an interest in the state to make sure
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
that our elections
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
are conducted in a manner such that
 
02:24:04.319 --> 02:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
are conducted in a manner such that
every

02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
citizen of the united states has the
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
right to vote
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
unless they're convicted of a felony and
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
currently serving
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
a sentence but the question is is
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
where do they have the right to vote and
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
rsa 654
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire says that
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
once they've established their domicile
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
and they've picked new hampshire as that
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
place more than any other
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
where they want to interact socially and
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
civilly and participate
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
that once they've established that
 
02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.389 align:start position:0%
that once they've established that
domicile

02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
domicile
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
they have the right to vote in new
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire okay
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
what does that mean established thank
 
02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
what does that mean established thank
you

02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%

thank you senator gray representative

prudenhome o'brien thank you ma'am
 
02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
my question i'm not sure if this is
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
correct to ask senator gray but you may
 
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:04.469 align:start position:0%
correct to ask senator gray but you may
know

02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
or senator guyton may or later we may
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon but when it comes to
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
it just came up so i want to ask and i
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
which we talked about there was a
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
concern about driver's licenses
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
and number changes of of driver's
 
02:25:22.399 --> 02:25:23.030 align:start position:0%
and number changes of of driver's
licenses

02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
and and i'm looking at my own driver's
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
license and i'm seeing a pattern
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't that be able to be
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
established by anyone who's
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
trying to find out the driver's license
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
number and notice the change
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
i recall a number just a few years ago i
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with a police officer
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
and he was telling me about driver's
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
license numbers and telling me about how
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
he could
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
he would know by asking me just a few
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
questions he could tell me what my
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license number was
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
just by asking a few questions and he
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
did so
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
you would know it by my birthday my um
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
because because the driver's license
 
02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
because because the driver's license
number

02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
used to be and mine used to be the first
 
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
letter last letter of my last name
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
my first letter of my first name and
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
then a series of numbers that talked
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
about my date of birth
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then a sequential number depending
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
on who else might have that
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
that was all changed and one of the
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why you see
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
in this bill is allowing the clerks to
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
go in
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
and look at the records or
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
ask for assistance is because their
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
record even if that was
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
given at the time of registration may
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
not match what the driver's license
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
number is now
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
which is more sequential random
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
depending on when you got the number etc
 
02:27:00.319 --> 02:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
depending on when you got the number etc
so

02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
it is not does not match that pattern
 
02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
it is not does not match that pattern
anymore

02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman um senator
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
did it come up in in the senate hearings
 
02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
did anybody mention that not all city
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
clerks have access to uh
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle records because some city
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
clerks don't register cars it's the tax
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
collector that does it
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at the last page here it
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
says that they can
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
contact either the local police or the
 
02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:34.309 align:start position:0%
contact either the local police or the
state

02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
to get that information okay further
 
02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:38.309 align:start position:0%
to get that information okay further
question

02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead um
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
also you mentioned the possibility of
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
looking up marriage records as an
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
example of
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
other means of identifying uh confirming
 
02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:50.389 align:start position:0%
other means of identifying uh confirming
someone's

02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
identity are you aware that every time a
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
clerk accesses the bureau of vital
 
02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
records database to search a record
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
we're charged the clerks have charged
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
the fee for doing so
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
that may be a good thing to uh to
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
add to this bill is that the fee is
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
waived for the state right
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
if that's the case uh i was not
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
aware of that so that may be a good
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
catch representative bergeron
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and and one final question um
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
if a city or town is getting 9 000
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots for a presidential
 
02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:27.990 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots for a presidential
election

02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
this is adding a terrific burden on on
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the clerks to be
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
verifying 9 000 applications to uh
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
before those ballots are either sent out
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
or or sent to the polls on election day
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
um i will check with the city clerk but
 
02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh here in rochester uh we did receive
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know multiple requests uh but
 
02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh again i believe that a very high
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
percentage of that
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
were people who actually came in and
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
voted in person
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
we actually in the community center set
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
up a satellite office
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
for the town or for the city clerk to be
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
able to process those people who came in
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
um wanting to do that so that
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
certainly reduced the burden on the town
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
clerks for
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
looking up any of this information and
 
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
trying to process them by mail
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%

speak to the bill currently being
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
considered and that is
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
