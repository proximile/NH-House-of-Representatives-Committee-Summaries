about the amendment
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
um since i had it drafted and
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's in everyone's email
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
this morning so hopefully you have a
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's very short especially
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
relative to what we've seen before
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
my concern here was in the section
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
273 d11 uh which was part of the
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
original build
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh it states and i'll read from the
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
original text the attorney general and
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
each county attorney
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
shall investigate any complaints and
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
violations of this chapter
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so on um my concern
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
was actually a couple things with this
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
first of all um
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
requiring each county attorney to
 
00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:30.870 align:start position:0%
requiring each county attorney to
investigate

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
requiring each county attorney to
 
00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:34.070 align:start position:0%
requiring each county attorney to
prosecute

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
to me it sounded like we're asking the
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
counties to get involved
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
with an area oh and thank you christina
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's up on the screen there
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
um asking the county attorneys
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
to get involved in areas of labor law
 
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:50.870 align:start position:0%
to get involved in areas of labor law
which

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
they may never have been before
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
furthermore we're requiring them to get
 
00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
furthermore we're requiring them to get
involved

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
with areas of labor law which they never
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
have before
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
and that concerned me from the 28 a
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint are we imposing a cost on the
 
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
standpoint are we imposing a cost on the
counties

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
and if so uh aren't we required to
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for that but secondly and this
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
was an issue
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
that apparently was discussed in the
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
senate hearings although not here
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
it says the the state attorney general
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
both says the attorney general and each
 
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.029 align:start position:0%
both says the attorney general and each
county

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
setting up this parallel investigation a
 
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
setting up this parallel investigation a
duplicative

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
investigation process of any complaint
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
that eventually will have to be resolved
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
well who's actually responsible
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
or as the assistant attorney
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
general greg albert said in the senate
 
00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
general greg albert said in the senate
hearings

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't get resolved it sets up
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
this double jeopardy case where
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
the state has a prosecution and the
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
county has a prosecution and they're
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
going on at the same time
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
so to solve that i had this amendment
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
drafted which took out the
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
explicit reference to the county
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys and said the attorney general
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
or his her designee which allows
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
um a single point of contact to
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
designate the counties
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
if that's the appropriate way to do it
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
within the state's attorney general
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
office or
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
if it's a different department
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the gist of it it's only a
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
couple of words
 
00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
couple of words
changed

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you thank you
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
all bye sarah seaworth
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
are there any um
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak regarding the
 
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak regarding the
amendments

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
here in the lobby see any online
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i cannot
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
um i agree with representative seaworth
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh it does uh resolve the double
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
jeopardy um issue
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the uh is created by having two
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
different entities do an investigation
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
um however it leaves in place a
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that the attorney general
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
or designee investigate and prosecute
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
that creates two problems number one
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
it takes the prosecutor prosecutor yeah
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.390 align:start position:0%
it takes the prosecutor prosecutor yeah
prosecutorial

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
discretion away from the attorney
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
it should be up to them to decide if a
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
case warrants investigation or
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution rather than us to tell them
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
they must prosecute every case
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
um therefore um i will not be supporting
 
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.310 align:start position:0%
um therefore um i will not be supporting
this

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
amendment representative cahill
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're recognized mr chair i'm just
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair um is it the
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
practice of the committee that will
 
00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:16.149 align:start position:0%
practice of the committee that will
accept

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
some amendments from committee members
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
on bills but not others that are offered
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
that executive session
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of the recent experience
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
with hb
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
with hb
113

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
amendments can be presented when there
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
is a positive motion
 
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
is a positive motion
um

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
i don't recall exactly the motion that
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
was on the floor
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
when we had uh
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
are you sure it was 115 113
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
as i recall there was an itl motion
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
which prevented the
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
consideration of the amendment i just
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's our normal practice to
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
do things that way
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
in labor and perhaps in the new
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
but that that was another day and i just
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that question out there
 
00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:16.549 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that question out there
for

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
us to think about
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
are always in order when it's going to
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to answer his question
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
i don't want anyone to think that there
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
was something that was done
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
on one bill and not on the other and it
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
was no 115
 
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:41.550 align:start position:0%
113 it's 113
 
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.750 align:start position:0%
113 it's 113
[Music]

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
relative to payment for earned but
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
unused vacation time
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
i believe the motion was itl
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
so there was no ability when there's a
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
negative motion
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm quite confident but the
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the negative uh
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
motion without the opportunity to offer
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
a positive motion
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
therefore uh prevented the amendment
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
which would have improved the bill
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh greatly so that was that was my issue
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that is the rule
 
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.029 align:start position:0%
i don't think that is the rule
representative

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
when there is a positive motion that's
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
always open to many
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
as many amendments as people want to
 
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:24.690 align:start position:0%
present with this negative motion
 
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:28.830 align:start position:0%
present with this negative motion
[Music]

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
and then the first motion was a a
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
negative motion
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh had the first motion been a positive
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
motion it would have been able to be
 
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.669 align:start position:0%
motion it would have been able to be
done

00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question whether
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
you don't like the answer or not i
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
apologize but uh
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to be consistent and
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think i have been
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have a an amendment there is a motion
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
on the floor there
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
we are in discussion mode are there any
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
in the llp seeing none

committee
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
you heard approximately six and a half
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
i personally received over 200 contacts
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
ranging from to postcards to qualcomms
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's quite clear that this bill is
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
opposed it's polarizing
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
the decisions we make today will impact
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
following those who contacted us
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
but it will shape the workforce
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
landscape and new hampshire
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
as such it is our task to unpack
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and does it do and
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
to make not
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
only the legal but the more of the
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
correct decision
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
that will best suit new hampshire it is
 
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.509 align:start position:0%
that will best suit new hampshire it is
clear

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
through the testimony received by this
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee that those involved
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
do not want this to pass it's clear that
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
those involved
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
unions believe in the benefits the
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
unions provide them they would like that
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's also clear that those involved in
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
unions believe that this bill
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
would be detrimental to the union's
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
ability to provide
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
the services that they have come to
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
enjoy and expect
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
however such several questions still
 
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.630 align:start position:0%
however such several questions still
remain

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
which may be asked many times a specific
 
00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
which may be asked many times a specific
evidence

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
of how this bill would prevent legions
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
from performing negatives and functions
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
that must provide anecdotal stories
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
although compelling are not the evidence
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
required to support such a position
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does not curtail any current
 
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
this bill does not curtail any current
functions

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
except one that one's forced membership
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
as well as forced payment for that
 
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
as well as forced payment for that
membership

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
those who are against this bill claim
 
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
those who are against this bill claim
repeatedly

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
that they have a right to a decent age
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
and to provide for their families
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
through the membership
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
and the terms that fund their
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
negotiations as well as apprenticeships
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
and legal assistance this is the
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
nothing can be a right in which you have
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
to steal from someone else
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
just because you have benefited in the
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
past it does not give you
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
the legal uh right or the morality right
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
to hold a gun to someone's head and
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
demand a force
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh you force them to pay for your
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
benefit as such the government cannot
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
take sides of the free market
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill within the practice of
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
institutional coercion
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
and force against the workers of new
 
00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
and force against the workers of new
hampshire

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
furthermore unions and owners would be
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
free to negotiate the contracts
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
facing fit one issue that was brought up
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
often was how it is to benefit from
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
media agreements
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is at the discretion of the unions
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
they may decide to either have a human
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
represent all workers in a shop
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
and thus must accommodate those who do
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
not pages
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
or the unions may decide to only
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
represent union members
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
in which case there is no such
 
00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:40.710 align:start position:0%
in which case there is no such
obligation

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
tied to non-union employees it's their
 
00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:45.030 align:start position:0%
tied to non-union employees it's their
choice

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
in closing i believe our needs will be
 
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
in closing i believe our needs will be
stronger

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
our workforce will be stronger our new
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire advantage will be stronger
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
i recommend this canadian support the
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
motion for ought to pass with amendment
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions here in the lobby or to me
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
we sat through a seven-hour hearing
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
where community member after community
 
00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%

member
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
begged us yet begged us not to take yet
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
another sledgehammer to
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
whatever is left of the american middle
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
class following two
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the most downwardly unequal economic
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
catastrophes in american history only 12
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
years apart from one another
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
we listen to them tell us that their
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
unions were there for them and despite
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
what glossy postcards with clearly fake
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
actors would have you believe
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation would be bad
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
and we listen to the leaders of business
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
and industry
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
the same people who loathe the unions
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
they deal with
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
as they swore up and down to us that
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is just a line of companies
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
waiting at the border for us to pass
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
so they can set up shop here and make
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
life better for everyone
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
it was clear in this committee that
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
there was a struggle last week
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
and the only question on my mind is
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
which side are you on
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
first let me dispel the fiction that
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
this legislation isn't aimed squarely at
 
00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
this legislation isn't aimed squarely at
unions

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
unions
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
when i asked a supporter of this bill in
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing why if this
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't a union busting bill why all of
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the normal union busters were lining up
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
to support it
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
and he responded with saying i don't
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
know that it will have no
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
impact on private sector union
 
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.670 align:start position:0%
impact on private sector union
organization

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
and he's right it will have an impact
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
the bia
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
the afp new england taxpayers and
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce aren't supporting
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
because they are committed to supporting
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
democracy in the workplace
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
they don't give one holler about that
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
their support is there
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
because this is the second part of the
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
plan that has been in place to bust
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
unions over the last four years
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
and it is propaganda that i myself have
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
fallen victim to before
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
part one consists of industry business
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
leadership and their allies
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
whispering into the years of every
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
non-union worker in america
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
to try to make them jealous they say
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
look at the unions
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
look at all the nice stuff they get the
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
nice pay
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
the benefits and they go on strike
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
despite those
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
you don't get any nice stuff don't you
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
hate the union and how entitled they are
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
and then they propose this alec
 
00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.190 align:start position:0%
and then they propose this alec
legislation

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that the same poor people they've
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
been spoon feeding nonsense to
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
won't stand up for the union and in this
 
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.230 align:start position:0%
won't stand up for the union and in this
case

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
they were wrong we had plenty of people
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
from across the political spectrum
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
including independents liberals and
 
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
including independents liberals and
former

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
former
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
republican reps come before us and tell
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
us this legislation is bad news
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
we had no such equivalence on other
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:56.630 align:start position:0%
we had no such equivalence on other
issues

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
there were no democrats that came before
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
us to tell us
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
that paid sick days were a bad idea
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
where the minimum wage was bad
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
it just didn't happen i've fallen for
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
this industry propaganda before
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
and now i realize the answer isn't for
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
less people to have solid unions
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's for more people to have them in
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
fact every worker
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
should have access to a union whether
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
they're in bristol new hampshire or
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
bessemer alabama
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
the very least we can do here today is
 
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.030 align:start position:0%
the very least we can do here today is
not

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
go out of our way to make things worse
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the working-class people in new
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire who labor every day
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it is on that note that i will end
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
my remarks
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
with this uh old mine don't listen to
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
the bosses
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't listen to their lies us poor folks
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
haven't got a chance
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comment
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative to me you're right
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
i've got a comment as well yes okay
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
when the majority of a group of
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
employees decide
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
that it is in their best interest to
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
bargain with their employer
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
as a group rather than as individuals
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
they go through a process that
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
culminates in an election
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
being held by a government agency if a
 
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.270 align:start position:0%
being held by a government agency if a
majority

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
of the group votes for the union
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
the group is then certified as the sole
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agent
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
this means that all negotiations for
 
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.589 align:start position:0%
this means that all negotiations for
wages

00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
wages
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
hours benefits and working conditions
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
between the employer
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the employees in that unit will be
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
held by the group's
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
collected leaders and or
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
by appointed union staff no one
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
in the group is ever required to join
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
the union
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
nor is anyone in the group required to
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
pay dues
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
or service fees at that time
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future generally
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations are held
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
proposals by both sides are made and
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
such as safety and sick lead procedures
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits or advancement by
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
seniority and or by merit
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
one such proposal that can be made by
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
the union
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
is that all members of the bargaining
 
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
is that all members of the bargaining
unit

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
pay a service fee for the cost of
 
00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:30.150 align:start position:0%
pay a service fee for the cost of
negotiations

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
and representation once
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
all these terms are agreed to by
 
00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:37.589 align:start position:0%
all these terms are agreed to by
management

00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
and by a vote of the union membership
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
they become company policy
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
and as such must be adhered to by both
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the employee senate bill 61
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
can not be allowed to interfere with
 
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:53.829 align:start position:0%
can not be allowed to interfere with
this

00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
mutually negotiated agreement between
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
two private parties
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
and as such uh
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 61 should be voted and
 
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.109 align:start position:0%
senate bill 61 should be voted and
expedient

00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%

dispel a few uh
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
issues that seem to always come up in
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
this debate
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%

um 36 years i joined 36 years ago i
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
joined my union voluntarily

uh we are a approximately a 99 percent
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%

and value received i constantly

members it's it's it's not
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a republican versus the
 
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.230 align:start position:0%
it's not a republican versus the
democrat

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
during my 36 years i spent nearly eight
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
of those years
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
in leadership positions at our national
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
union i was a negotiator as a board of
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
director i worked on many
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh committees involved in arbitrations
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
um i've done a lot of union work um
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
personal union work during my time
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things i found interesting
 
00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:02.790 align:start position:0%
one of the things i found interesting
during

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
during
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing the other day
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
was one of the most common
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
issues or complaints or expectations is
 
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:12.550 align:start position:0%
issues or complaints or expectations is
that

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
should this pass there's going to be
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
this mass exodus
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
of union members from the existing
 
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
of union members from the existing
unions

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
unions
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
now i know in my personal experience
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've never seen that happen
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
as i said we're about a 99 voluntary
 
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.710 align:start position:0%
as i said we're about a 99 voluntary
union

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
union
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
as the hearing went on i i just randomly
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
asked two individuals
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
who i knew had been affected by the
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
janus decision
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
three years ago which extended right to
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
work to all public sector unions
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
and prior to that i've been trying to
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
get data on just how many people had
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
dropped out of union so
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
we had a uh a former rep who was
 
00:43:57.359 --> 00:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
we had a uh a former rep who was
testifying

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
he's a current firefighter and i asked
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
him specifically
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
how many members of your brothers in
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
your firefighter unions have
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit a little while later uh
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
rich gullah from the seiu
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
who represents i believe he said one uh
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
private union and then uh one private
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
sector union and then
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
40 plus public sector unions i asked him
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the same question
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
after janus and his answer was
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
none in fact we've gained membership
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
that uh fear grenade if you will that
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
members are going to start leaving just
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
won't happen and the reason
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
is those union members feel
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
or believe that they are receiving an
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
adequate value from their union
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
just as i do i will say
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
however that at any time in my remaining
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
five years at the ili pilots association
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
if i believe i'm not receiving an
 
00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.230 align:start position:0%
if i believe i'm not receiving an
adequate

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
to stop being a union member and stop
 
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.670 align:start position:0%
to stop being a union member and stop
paying

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh union dues i pay one in one and a
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
half percent of my
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
wages every year i can plan on
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
continuing that
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
i get good value and i uh should have
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
the ability for uh
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of choice should that point ever
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representatives
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
online representative cahill
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
is recognized thank you mr chair
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
for the record i am not now nor have i
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
ever been a member of the union i
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
haven't had that
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity though i i would have taken
 
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.270 align:start position:0%
opportunity though i i would have taken
up

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
and i i agree that there is value as my
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
good friend mr torkat said that there is
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
value in the union
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and people should pay for what they get
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't contribute to the
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the union either by a union dues or
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
union fees you're simply getting a free
 
00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:07.190 align:start position:0%
union fees you're simply getting a free
ride

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
ride
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
and having all the others all your other
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
pay for this benefit that you receive at
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
no cost and this just doesn't work that
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
way in our society so i will be voting
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
your rights
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
i said the right to work people she goes
 
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
i said the right to work people she goes
yes

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i i could only give them 25 because
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's all i could afford
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
i i was stunned i grabbed her by the
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
shoulders and said maria
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for thinking of me don't ever
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
send them money again
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
they have plenty of money and i know you
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
struggle to support your son
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
and then as i walked away with tears
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
going down my eyes
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
i felt that knife in my heart about to
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
stick up for these people
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
as long as i can and expose the people
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
for what they are
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
they have never done anything to help
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
they've never stopped the family from
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
losing their home in foreclosure
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
they've never stopped the family from
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
having their motor vehicle repossessed
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
they have never contributed morally
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
physically or financially to someone who
 
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.390 align:start position:0%
physically or financially to someone who
lost

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
a loved one these are people here
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire our union members and
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
our working people

are our community where this money goes
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
to virginia they don't do anything and
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
they don't care about what happens to us
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
we just wish they tried to stop fooling
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
and tricking them into donating to
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
something that works against them
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
and our community thank you mr chairman
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
love to take any questions that anyone
 
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
love to take any questions that anyone
has

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative burundi
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're on mute representative
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:30.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
fellow

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
fellow
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh as a long-time
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
president for over 30 years
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
as a president of a local and a
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
negotiator for
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
over 40 years i'd like to make
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh a connection of why i cannot support
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill i cannot support the right to
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
work bill
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
s sb 61 because i feel that this bill
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
is unfair to workers it will allow
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
employees to benefit from a collective
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
without contributing to the cost of
 
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.790 align:start position:0%
without contributing to the cost of
negotiating

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
negotiating
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
as well as implementing the collective
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
i also am very concerned
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
with the workforce morel there will be
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
created by this bill
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
because the right to work bill sb 61
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
will pit workers who have contributed
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
to the cost of the collective bargaining
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
agreement against those that have reaped
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
the benefits
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
without contributing to the costs and
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a big concern
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
because i can remember when i was
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
employed that people who were not
 
00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
employed that people who were not
members

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
nobody spoke to them they were great
 
00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:47.030 align:start position:0%
nobody spoke to them they were great
teachers

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
but they were ostracized until
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
we negotiated a
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the school board for a
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
a fee for them to pay for the
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
negotiation process
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative i
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
have hands up
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
on the zoom representative sullen smith
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if i heard it once
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
i heard it a thousand times
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
right to work is not right for new
 
00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.710 align:start position:0%
right to work is not right for new
hampshire

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rights from all all
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
corners of the state
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition to this bill i
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
lost count of the number of republican
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
voters who came out forcefully against
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
right to work for less
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
our republican brothers and sisters
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
clearly do love their unions
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
of course the out-of-state lobbyists
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
made their case
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
they directed us to look carefully at
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
the states of have passed work to
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
right to work in the last few years
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
that was clever because right to work
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
an immediate impact as uh representative
 
00:52:56.319 --> 00:52:57.030 align:start position:0%
an immediate impact as uh representative
turcotte

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
found out through his questioning this
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a long-term
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
if if you look more closely at these
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
states that have had right to work for
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
some decades
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are earning less
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're the ones with weaker unions
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
they're the ones with more folks on
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
welfare it's a long-term impact on
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
unions and workers that are of concern
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
right to work is union busting
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislation plain and simple
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not right for new hampshire
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
let's not join the race to the bottom
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should be raising up and
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
supporting our workforce
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
right to work for less is wrong for new
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire it should be itl
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
highlight what i took away from
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from last week and more in the
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of emails that we
 
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.790 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of emails that we
received

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
this is what i heard i was able to buy a
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
house for my family and participate in
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
my community
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
in my church in supporting the food bank
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
and special olympics and the nashua
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
children's home
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
because of my union i have more
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
disposable income to spend
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire in my neighborhood
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
and to support local businesses isn't
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
this what we should be striving for
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
secure families and strong communities
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
the truth is nobody is ever forced to
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
join the union
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill is an unnecessary
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
intrusion by the government
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that you know this will do what it
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
has done in other states
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
it will destroy good unions we've stood
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
against this
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
together for almost 40 years and we need
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
to do this again
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative susie
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
i know everything's been stated but i'm
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to reiterate a few things that uh
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
i took away from the hearing um
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
first of all this is going to be my 11th
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
time voting against
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation and some of the
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
problems i have
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i think people hit the notes very
 
00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:10.549 align:start position:0%
and i think people hit the notes very
well

00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill during
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing the emails uh people
 
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.309 align:start position:0%
the hearing the emails uh people
testifying

00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
to me it's very clear um that they don't
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
want right to work here
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
that it's not a problem um
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
what i find problematic
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
is as a committee
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
and i said this to mr juve
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
from the bia is that on two other bills
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
we clearly stated that
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
there wasn't they we didn't want
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
government intrusion
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
and privately held businesses
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
so why now why a union company
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
why are we going to have government
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
intrusion in a
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
privately held company answers pretty
 
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.150 align:start position:0%
privately held company answers pretty
simple

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it's a union there's no
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
statistical data that anybody showed
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
during the hearings that's
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
show that this is going to benefit the
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire economy
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's no statistical data showing that
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
people are going to line up at the
 
00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:33.190 align:start position:0%
people are going to line up at the
borders

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
borders
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
to come here and open new businesses
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
what was very clear was that
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
our constituents do not want right to
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
work here
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's disappointing to see that an ought
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other members of
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
online that would like to speak on the
 
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:10.630 align:start position:0%
online that would like to speak on the
motion

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
i see no others anyone in the
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
lob wishing to speak
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
anyone wishing to speak a second time
 
00:57:20.559 --> 00:57:21.670 align:start position:0%
anyone wishing to speak a second time
representative

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
pageant thank you mr chairman i watched
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
a question for you
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
um i appreciated your earlier
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh commentary with representative cahill
 
00:57:32.079 --> 00:57:32.789 align:start position:0%
uh commentary with representative cahill
about

00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee consistency on making sure
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
we're hearing the same things
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
if that is the case wouldn't the correct
 
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.109 align:start position:0%
if that is the case wouldn't the correct
motion

00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
on this be to retain
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
because the logic that was established
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the president that's established by
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee on labor
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
as it regarded to the minimum wage bill
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
was that we were not going to deal with
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in committee
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
that was actively being debated in dc
 
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.270 align:start position:0%
that was actively being debated in dc
which

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
the pro act a bill that would strip out
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of state's rights to work laws
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
is so in the name of that consistency
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be the correct motion
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
so so when this when this committee
 
00:58:21.119 --> 00:58:22.069 align:start position:0%
so so when this when this committee
retained

00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
the 15 hour minimum wage bill we said
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to move forward with
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
it because
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
we were waiting to see the fate of
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
competing legislation in washington
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
that might influence state decision
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
if this house and it ultimately gets
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
signed a right to work law
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
and then the pro act immediately comes
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards that strips that legislation
 
00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.270 align:start position:0%
afterwards that strips that legislation
out

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're establishing a
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
precedent for the minimum wage
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily agree since you
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
asked this of me uh that there's that's
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
apple's apples the
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
the right the minimum wage was initially
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
pending immediately with the new cares
 
00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:05.430 align:start position:0%
pending immediately with the new cares
act

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
and some of the things that were going
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
on uh the pro
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
act um see is either immediately pending
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
or something that's going to come up
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the next week or two i believe that
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
was my understanding of why
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
i at least supported
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a comment uh if
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
everyone else
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
has completed their their comments on
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
the motion of the floor
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
um someone actually said to me
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
well you took money from the right to
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
work people
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
i have never taken money from the right
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
to work folks
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
i have never given money to the right to
 
00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.190 align:start position:0%
i have never given money to the right to
work

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
folks i've never met with the people
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
from the right to work
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh i did have one phone conversation
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
companies find influence spending a
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars i don't know
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
who they
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
sent it to but i don't know anyone in
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
this committee i certainly did not
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
and would not take their money even if
 
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
and would not take their money even if
offered

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
offered
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of things that go on in
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
in that regards uh there's supposedly
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know you only take what you read
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars worth of money
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
going into a house rep race in merrimack
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's from out of state
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
i try to look at both sides
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
i listened to everyone what they said i
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
listened and wrote excuse me read every
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
single email i received on this and
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
there were a lot
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
i even responded to some people
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
requesting some additional information
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
the one thing that struck me that was so
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
disappointing in this entire process
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
to me was the fear and anger
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
that has been instilled by the people
 
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.069 align:start position:0%
that has been instilled by the people
who

01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
contacted me that this was going to ruin
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
their way of life
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
ruin their salaries ruin their benefits
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
and i tried to weigh the
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
positive and negative things that i have
 
01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:24.710 align:start position:0%
positive and negative things that i have
read

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to have increased more
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
infant mortality
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
and and the the deaths in on
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
workplace or more in new hampshire than
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
others and
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
i like to deal with data show me the
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
data show me the information
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
i have no issue with unions whatsoever i
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't like some of
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
arbitration that comes out case in point
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
the city of manchester recently without
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
having to pay a year's page or a police
 
01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.109 align:start position:0%
having to pay a year's page or a police
officer

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
after he was fired for i think some
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
significant cause
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
so some things like that i don't like to
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
see but
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
overall i do not have any issue with
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
unions i think
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
actually unions probably have done some
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the best things for this
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
country in the 1800s and 1900s what they
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
did in the five-day work week and
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
getting benefits and
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
reducing child labor and everything else
 
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.109 align:start position:0%
reducing child labor and everything else
um

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
but it all comes down to my opinion of
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
this going to be good for new hampshire
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
or not and i like it in your
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
um mystery box
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
the mystery box um analogy you use just
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
you don't know what's inside
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
so what do you want so you don't know if
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
anything inside that message box is good
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
or bad
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
and so you have to look at what's going
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
to possibly happen and i think the thing
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
that swayed me was the recent
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
article by the josiah bartlett
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
that states adjacent
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
to other states that do not have right
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
see a significant increase in both union
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
and non-union
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
employment hampshire is a very unique
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
state we all know that
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
we cannot compare new hampshire to
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
alabama or wisconsin or many other
 
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.270 align:start position:0%
alabama or wisconsin or many other
states

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
um we have to look at how things are
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
here uh into states around us
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i honestly feel
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
that passing this will be a
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
benefit to jobs
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire both union
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
and non-union
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
um and that's why i will be supporting
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
i don't it does bother me
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
personally as i said earlier the fear
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
and the anger
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
as well some of the inappropriate phone
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
calls to my home
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
but hey you know that's what we that's
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
what we can pay the big bucks for here
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
um to take it and to listen to folks
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i honestly feel um
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
this will benefit new hampshire because
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
of our position in new england
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
because of the way new hampshire is the
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
way our tax position is
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
um young people are coming back in new
 
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:14.950 align:start position:0%
um young people are coming back in new
hampshire

01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
and i hope this would even help them so
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting bill
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
